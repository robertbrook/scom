Disabled People (Access)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>1. <span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What plans she has to amend Article 103 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 in respect of access for disabled people. (47186)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are no proposals to amend article 103 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991, but I may be able to provide more information when I have heard the supplementary question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled that there are no arrangements to amend, when there is a proposal before the House. Does the Minister accept that insufficient consideration is being given to the need for open access for people with disabilities as distinct from those who drive invalid cars? Government policy is to provide open access for people with disabilities, but the proposal will restrict such people from part of Belfast.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are no proposals to change the order, but a consultation document has been issued. The problem arises throughout the United Kingdom. When it is necessary to provide exemptions for some vehicles in pedestrianised areas, there are complaints about abuse of those areas. The Department is not prohibiting access for disabled people to Belfast city centre; it has simply issued notice of its intention to maintain pedestrian priority and to reduce the number of vehicles using the main shopping area. We are introducing special arrangements to provide six parking places for holders of orange badges in the central pedestrian area and approximately 70 parking bays for disabled people on the periphery of the central pedestrian priority area. There has been consultation with organisations for disabled people, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we need a balance between people's general desire for pedestrianised areas with access for some categories of vehicles and the difficulty that arises when there are 15,000 holders of orange badges in the Belfast area.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will accept that the 15,000 holders of orange badges do not go to the city centre at the same time. I accept the concept of limiting the use of the orange badge, but those with certain disabilities will be unable to go to Belfast city centre. Will the Minister keep the matter under review because the disability lobby has contacted me with its concerns?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course we understand those concerns, and I urge organisations for the disabled to return to the Department for discussions. The consultation paper has been issued and I hope that the Department's invitation will be accepted.</span></p>

Repair Grants (Houses)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>2. <span class='member'>Mr William Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What plans she has to review repair grants for houses in Northern Ireland. (47187)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ((Mr. Tony Worthington)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Repair grants have been reviewed and a proposal for a draft housing order to be published later this year will include a number of changes to Housing Executive grants, including repair grants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that the previous major change to repair grants altered the criteria from the state of the house to the capacity of the individual to pay, plus changes in relation to landlords. That has had some unforeseen consequences. In some areas, not least the Londonderry and Limavady council areas, there have been long delays—at one stage, up to two years—between initial application and initial inspection. That delay has been reduced, but what steps do the Minister and the Housing Executive intend to take to reduce that delay further and to ensure a more equable distribution of funding throughout Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will respond to the consultation paper that is shortly to be issued. The Department thought it necessary to review the grants because of the considerable lack of consistency of approach by environmental health officers. One of the criteria for getting a grant has been the issue of a pubic health notice, but the procedure by which owner-occupiers can apply for a public health notice has led to abuses of the system. Other changes are proposed, but I urge the hon. Gentleman to look at the consultation paper and check with the Department of the Environment to be sure that the consultation has been fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The other point is that replacement grants will have to be carefully considered, because some of the sums granted for replacement dwellings are surprisingly high. Something will have to be done in that respect, because those who sought replacement grants as an alternative to a repair grant never expected—or, indeed, wanted—what we have actually seen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments. Again, I urge him to look at the document, because he will find that that aspect is covered.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the past, there has been fraudulent use of grants; I hope that that has now passed. Are security measures in place to prevent such fraud in Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have detailed knowledge on the question of fraud. When discrepancies occur in the issue of public health notices, one assumes that the strict criteria for the awarding of the grant have not been applied. Following what was said by the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross), there is a desire to limit the amount of money that can be paid out in grant, particularly when one suspects that it is not the best use of public money.</span></p>

Prisoners (Releases)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>3. <span class='member'>Mr William Thompson (West Tyrone)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the maximum number of prisoners eligible for release under the provisions of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill, by quarter, over the next two years. (47188)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the terms of the Sentences Bill, which has been considered by the House and is now in the other place, it will be for the sentencing commission to determine whether prisoners are eligible for release. It is obviously not for me to prejudge the decisions of the commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed in the Minister's reply. I should have expected the Department to know the maximum number of prisoners who could be released during the various quarters, given that it knows all about the sentencing conditions and the number of days still to be served. I am disappointed that the Minister has not been able to supply that information. The Minister hit on the word eligible. What are the Department's figures on the number of prisoners who could be released each quarter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. gentleman might be less disappointed had I anticipated his supplementary question. I obviously cannot say who will be eligible, because when the sentencing commission is up and running it will be a matter of judicial function. However, I can give the hon. Gentleman an estimate of the number of prisoners who seem to have been convicted of qualifying offences—that is, persons who were sentenced to five years or more, or for life, for a scheduled offence that was committed before 10 April and not scheduled out by the Attorney-General. In that category, there are approximately 418 prisoners. However, as I said to the hon. Gentleman, whether those prisoners satisfy the other conditions will be a matter for the commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that the criminal—almost certainly a murderer—who perpetrated the explosion at Canary Wharf, which signalled the end of the previous IRA ceasefire, will also be eligible for release after two years? The crime was committed on the United Kingdom mainland against people who could not vote in the referendum of the peace
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
agreement. Is the person who was responsible likely still to have access to large quantities of explosives such as Semtex, or will some of those explosives have been handed in by then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I cannot comment on the hon. Gentleman's last question, but I can deal with his first one. Matters connected with that question may of course be the subject of further legal proceedings and it would be improper for me to prejudice those proceedings by commenting on the court's decisions. I cannot comment on whether an individual prisoner will qualify for release, or on when a prisoner could be released, under the legislation. As I have said, no prisoner will automatically qualify for release. Only prisoners serving sentences in Northern Ireland will be eligible to apply. Prisoners sentenced in England and Wales who are transferred to serve sentences in Northern Ireland could, of course, apply to the commissioners who would decide whether those prisoners satisfied the legislation's conditions. Prisoners so released will be on licence, and can be recalled if the terms of the licence are breached in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Hope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend and the Government on yesterday's successful inaugural meeting of the Assembly. In view of the questions asked this morning, does he share my opinion that it would be entirely wrong to break the agreement? I understand the worries of those who voted no in the referendum or in the elections. However, does he agree that, as democrats, we should accept and implement the agreement in good faith, and move towards the future positively?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that point, especially with regard to the Assembly, upon which we may touch during this morning's debate. As he says, the agreement is a package that consists of more than just constitutional matters. The Northern Ireland people's vote in favour of the agreement by a substantial majority was in many ways replicated in the Assembly elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response to the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan), who raised the matter of the person who was sentenced for the bombing of Canary Wharf, suggests that that prisoner may be eligible for release under the scheme. It is disgraceful that a person who was involved in such a heinous crime should be released after two years. That may be democracy, but it is not justice. Will the Minister confirm that terrorists who are presently sought by the police, if charged and convicted, will also be eligible for release after two years if they meet the criteria? How can the Minister, or any member of the Government, justify that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said in an earlier reply, no prisoner will automatically qualify for release. The matter will be for the commissioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the clear and reasonable sensitivities that have been expressed by the Opposition, can the Minister assure us that careful
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
consideration wil be given to the message that prisoner release conveys? As the prisoner release programme is intended to reduce tensions, can he also assure us that the Government will be extremely careful not to increase tensions by their implementation of that programme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I perfectly understand that. I welcome the return to the Committee of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr Öpik). He has gone through particular traumas, and we are delighted to see him. I agree that the issue is a difficult one. It was recognised as such when the agreement was put together in Castle Buildings before Good Friday. I understand that many people in Northern Ireland have been touched in some way by violence over the past 30 years. These matters have to be dealt with sensitively, which is why the commission has been established to deal with individual cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) asked about the number of prisoners in Northern Ireland that are to be released, but prisoners can transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. How many terrorist prisoners connected with the IRA are imprisoned in Great Britain, and how many are expected to be transferred?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the precise figures, but I shall write to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In respect of the release of terrorist prisoners, will the Minister assure us that the victims who suffered at their hands will be consulted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. Under the proposed legislation, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has a duty to provide information to victims on persons who may be released under the scheme. That will include information on those applying for release, whether or not release has been granted. If granted, the proposed date of release will be provided. However, there are important provisos. Not all victims will want to be informed. My right hon. Friend will respect their wishes and will provide information only if requested. No information will be released that poses a threat to the safety of any person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his earlier reply. Of the 418 prisoners what will be the maximum number of releases per quarter? We need to have some idea of the programme based on the assumption that all who are technically eligible to apply will get out. Is not it the reality that under the agreement, all those prisoners will get out? That is what Sinn Fein has required and that is what it expects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree. The hon. Gentleman knows from the Bill's passage through the House—it is now in another place—that the release of prisoners depends on the decisions of the sentencing commission. If the commission thinks that the release of a particular person poses a danger to society, it will not release him.</span></p>

Road Schemes</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4. <span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If she will list the financial commitments and commencement dates of the road schemes to be proceeded with under the Chancellor of the Exchequer's economic package for Northern Ireland.(47189)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will bear with me while I list the information.<br><br>
The additional £87 million that my hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer allocated to the roads programme will enable the Roads Service to carry out a significant programme of work on the strategic road network. Details of the financial allocation and proposed commencement dates of the various schemes are as follows: Westlink roads and bridges, an allocation of £35 million, proposed commencement date 1999–2000; Belfast to Larne road, an allocation of £10 million, proposed commencement date 2000–2001; Loughbrickland to Newry road, an allocation of £15 million, proposed commencement date 2000–2021; Antrim to Ballymena road, an allocation of £7 million, proposed commencement date 1999–2000; Londonderry to Ballygawley road, an allocation of £12 million, proposed commencement date 1998–1999; and, finally Toome bypass, an allocation of £8 million, proposed commencement date 2000–2001.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. We welcome the allocation of funds by the Chancellor for roads in Northern Ireland, but will the sale of Belfast port have to go ahead before the sums that the Minister mentions are spent? He will recall that when his party was in opposition it was against the sale of Belfast port. Will Belfast port be privatised to provide money for the road programme? If that is the case, will it be privatised before the Assembly has considered the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The income that is anticipated by the Chancellor, which includes the sale of the Belfast port, is a substantial part of the package, but it is not the only part. My right hon. Friend's promises about road improvements will be honoured. The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that when the Assembly is up and running, it will be for its Members to decide how to spend money on roads in Northern Ireland. They will decide which projects to fund—my ministerial colleagues and I faced that difficulty previously. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor is certain that the roads to which I referred are strategic and highly important routes, and that they should be handled in the way that I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If some of the expenditure is conditional on the sale of Belfast harbour, will steps be taken to ensure maximum benefit to the public purse? We should not create fat cats overnight or end up in a situation similar to that which resulted from the sale of Belfast airport. The sale of public assets should ensure maximum benefit to the public purse.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0627">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with the hon. Gentleman. Lessons can be learned from previous sales and privatisations, and I hope that there will be no fat cats. If the sale of Belfast harbour raises sufficient funds, the money will certainly be used for important transport schemes in the Province.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the sale be completed before the Northern Ireland Assembly takes over the relevant responsibilities, or will the Treasury be responsible for the sale? What safeguards are in place to ensure that there will be no repetition of previous problems? It is important to emphasise the economic situation and the role of the Westlink. Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland firms face blockades which prevent them from getting their goods to market at the earliest possible opportunity, but money was promised in that connection. Might slippage occur again—might future promises likewise slip away? Is the new plan designed to punish Belfast harbour? At one stage, money was to be put into that scheme but the trust would not allow harbour money to be used to assist businesses that were outside the harbour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly no intention of punishing Belfast harbour, or any other body, but I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point about the Westlink. As I said to the hon. Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe), the Westlink has been allocated £35 million, for the reason that he described. The sale will take some time, and the Assembly might be established by the time that the scheme is finalised. It is important for my ministerial colleagues and I—and shadow Ministers in the Assembly—to work in harmony in that regard. This is an opportunity for the port, and we have adopted the best approach. I assure him that the Department of Finance and Personnel and other Northern Ireland Departments are examining the terms of the sale very carefully, and the speed with which it could be effected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister giving a categorical assurance that all the schemes will go ahead according to the time scale that he outlined this morning, or is he saying that they will be subject to review by the Assembly? People in Northern Ireland are exercised about whether the terms can be changed. Assurances have been given, but have they been set in stone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that, in life and politics, nothing is ever set in stone or concrete. All I can say is that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
it clear that, as a consequence of consultations in Northern Ireland, those were his priorities and those of the Northern Ireland Departments on the roads programme. I cannot anticipate what Members of the Assembly are likely to do, but I hope that by the time the Assembly takes over, much work will already have been done by way of preparation and in anticipation of those schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the announcement that £12 million will be spent on the Ballygawley to Londonderry road. What schemes will be covered by the £12 million? I hope that it will commence within this year, 1998–99. If the Minister does not yet know which schemes are involved, perhaps he will let me know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. He will understand that I do not have details of the schemes in my possession, but I shall write to him on that point. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) refrain from conferring with a person in the Public Gallery?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the Minister's reply, can he say whether the money that is being supplied by the Chancellor will be additional to the financial plans that have already been presented by each region in Northern Ireland? Will the money that is being provided finish the dualling of the A26 between Antrim and Ballymena? What improvements will be made to the road from Cores corner to Lame with that money, and how much of the Larne road will be improved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The £10 million that has been allocated to the A8 Belfast-Larne road will enable the Roads Service to carry out substantial improvements. I assure the hon. Gentleman that road safety, in which I know he is interested, will be an important factor when the detailed design is finalised. On his more general point, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has allocated specific money to those schemes. That is extra money, over and above the money usually set aside for such schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the debate on the draft Appropriation (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998. I remind the Committee that the debate may continue for three hours.</span></p>

Appropriation (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.27 am</p>
</section>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Appropriation (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
Details of the sums are given in the estimates booklet and the statement of excess, which I arranged for members of the Committee to receive in advance of today's sitting. The order covers, in total, almost £7,000 million of expenditure—an increase of 6 per cent. on 1997–98. The Committee needs no reminding that estimates from the Northern Ireland Office, covering law and order services and other services dealt with by the Northern Ireland Office, are not covered by the order. It covers expenditure totalling £7,000 million, which, after February of next year or thereabouts, will be the direct responsibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly and its Executive.<br><br>
Yesterday, at the inaugural meeting in Belfast of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister were appointed. It will fall to them and their colleagues and the Assembly as a whole, in February, March and beyond of next year, to deal with all the matters to which members of the Committee will undoubtedly refer this morning: education, health, transport, agriculture, roads, the environment, housing and local government. All those matters, which are currently dealt with by the six Northern Ireland Departments, will become matters for the Assembly. The Committee will be aware of the momentous change that that will bring in the years ahead if, as we all hope and pray, the Assembly is successful.<br><br>
As the House of Commons will deal with the block grant, it will still have an important say in how the money is distributed. Similar arrangements will apply to Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland in that respect. There should be—and I am sure that there will be—a good working relationship between the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly with regard to the distribution of these funds. Seven thousand million pounds is a great deal of money for a population of 1.6 million. However, it is necessary money, not only because of the problems of the past 30 years but because—as in my country of Wales—of the decline of staple industries, such as shipbuilding in Northern Ireland or coal and steel in my part of the world. Places like Northern Ireland therefore need and deserve such public expenditure.<br><br>
I shall refer only briefly to the sums of money in the booklet. Members of the Committee, especially Northern Ireland Members, must be given the opportunity to discuss in the House and in this Committee matters affecting them, their constituents and people living in Northern Ireland in general. The Minister with responsibilities for health and education, the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who will wind up the debate, has specific responsibilities for much of the expenditure to which I refer and to which other members of the Committee will refer in their speeches.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
The Committee should note that £17 million will fund EU and national agricultural support measures that apply throughout the country. Members representing agricultural constituencies will be especially interested in some other measures. Fourteen million pounds will provide support for farming in special areas by means of headage payments on hill cattle and sheep. Funding of £130 million will be provided for on-going regional services and support measures, and that will include £63 million for agriculture and agricultural products industries. Farm support, enhancement of the countryside, fisheries and forestry will receive funding of £23 million. Twenty-two million pounds will be provided for central administration and information technology. Funding will also be provided for the Rivers Agency, some of which will match European Union funding.<br><br>
The money allocated to the Department of Economic Development—especially the £160 million for the Industrial Development Board—will provide opportunities for economic and industries development in Northern Ireland. Those opportunities will inevitably be enhanced by the advent of peace and—as a consequence of the Assembly—political stability. When the Assembly is up and running, I hope that whichever Department is responsible for economic development will have the capacity to increase the good work of past years in encouraging industrial investment. It does not matter whether that is inward investment or investment from Europe, the United States or elsewhere. What matters is that the work force in Northern Ireland—particularly its younger members who are highly trained in information technology—are ready to take advantage of the opportunities ahead.<br><br>
People often talk of the Celtic tiger and of the way in which the Republic of Ireland has developed in the past decade, which has been partly due to its membership of the European Union. That development also occurred because that country had the sense to ensure that its young people were well trained in skills and technology. The opportunities ahead for Northern Ireland will depend not only on the way in which it governs itself but on a sound educational system on which much can be built, and to which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will undoubtedly refer when he winds up the debate.<br><br>
A sum of £210 million is sought for the Training and Employment Agency; £62 million will fund nearly 15,000 training places under the job skills training programme. There will be £23 million to assist companies in improving their competitiveness by developing the skills of their work forces. Under the Government's welfare-to-work initiative, £40 million will be used to provide employment and training for young people in Northern Ireland as part of the new deal. From November, £42 million will be provided to assist the long-term unemployed, establishing 30,000 places for them.<br><br>
The Northern Ireland tourist board will receive about £14 million. That is an interesting and significant point, because as it increasingly becomes evident that there is peace in Northern Ireland, people will want to see the great treasures there. That will provide great opportunities for tourism; indeed, the Republic of Ireland has exploited such opportunities extensively. The tourist industry that has been developed in the south of Ireland could also be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
extended to Northern Ireland. Tourism currently accounts for 6 per cent. of GDP in the republic; it is 2 per cent. in Northern Ireland. IF we can exploit the potential for tourism in the north, and attain the same percentage of gross domestic product as in the south, we could create 8,000 extra jobs. The opportunity is there.<br><br>
We have referred to the environment in questions; and £174 million has bee allocated for roads, transport and ports, of which £20 million will be for road passenger services. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the voluntary housing movement will receive £267 million. The total resources for housing in Northern Ireland next year will be just over £600 million. An amount of £194 million will be allocated for the provision of water and sewerage services, of which £87 million is for capital spending and £104 million is for operation and maintenance. Hon. members—especially those from Northern Ireland—will be aware that much remains to be done in relation to the water and sewerage infrastructure. That will be a high priority for the new Assembly and for those hon. Members representing Northern Ireland who will be involved with the estimates. It will be a major task to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to achieve economic development.<br><br>
A host of environmental and other services will receive £190 million; that is about £5 million more than last year. The Northern Ireland Fire Authority will receive £44 million. Almost £1,500 million will be provided for education in next year's budget. Taking into account the sale of the student loan debt, spending will increase by just over 3 per cent.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will probably refer to several of the matters relating to education that he has considered during the past year. There are some good stories about education in Northern Ireland: the development of Springvale; the fact that the Department and the boards now work together on school improvement plans; the fact that 20 per cent. of children will begin pre-school education this year; the restoration fo cuts in the library budget; the fact that further education colleges now stand on their own and that there has been a tremendous new investment in computers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not catch the exact capital figures. Will the Minister repeat them? Do the figures refer only to public finance or do they include the amount that it is hoped will be provided from private finance initiatives?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The bulk of the expenditure is public. There will be an announcement soon about private-public partnerships in education. I know that the hon. member for Belfast, South is interested in that matter. When that announcement is made, I hope that we will be able to draw on public funds and on those private companies that are interested in providing decent education opportunities for people in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The estimates allow for £1,600 million for hospital, community health and personal social services, health and social services trusts and family health services: that is an increase of about 2.3 per cent. on last year's final net
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
provision. That takes place in the year of the 50th anniversary of the national health service, the introduction of which was as welcome in Northern Ireland as it was in Britain.<br><br>
There is still much to be done in the health service in Northern Ireland, as there is in the rest of the country, but the priority that my Government places upon that will be reflected by the priority that is placed on it by the new Assembly. With regard to the health service, I do not believe that there is any difference in the priorities of the elected politicians who took their seats in Belfast yesterday and those of hon. members in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that today the Prime Minister is to announce funding for a modernisation programme for the national health service. Will the Minister ensure that Northern Ireland gets its fair share of the moneys that are made available for that? As he knows, Northern Ireland takes great pride in its health service. However, there is always a need as there is in the rest of the country to update and modernise the resources that are available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the Question is yes. It is important that any modernisation plans are spread in such a way that all parts of our country, including Northern Ireland, will benefit. When the comprehensive spending review announcement is made later this month, I hope that good reference will be made to the health service in this, its 50th anniversary year.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to the funding of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, whereby £9 million is sought for set-up and operational costs. Assemblies have to be paid for—democracy has to be paid for—and we have therefore to include in the appropriation costs the costs of setting up the Assembly that met yesterday in Belfast. When it is up and running, after February or March 1999, it will have to pay for its own running, like its Welsh and Scottish counterparts. However, that is a small price to pay for political stability and a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. No one will begrudge Northern Ireland its fair share.<br><br>
I have made only a short speech so as to ensure that Committee members, especially those from Northern Ireland, have an opportunity to look at the figures, comment on them and, I hope, approve them at the end of the debate.</span></p>
<p>10.42 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross (East Londonderry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of Members of my own and other Opposition parties, I express abhorrence of the arson attacks that took place last night on places of worship in Northern Irleand. My own parish suffered in such a way a couple of years ago, and I have personal experience of how hurtful and nasty such behaviour is. Why or by whom it was done is not yet known, but it was certainly a vicious and wicked series of acts, which was carefully planned. It wil undoubtedly cut into the sums that are available to the Minister and which could be put to better use than the repair of arson damage.<br><br>
The £7 billion that the Minister announced this morning is, of course, a global sum. When I first came to the House of Commons I was taught to be fairly sceptical about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0630">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Government accountancy practices. I am well aware that, while the Minister can announce a global sum today and the Chancellor of the Exchequer can announce £200 million for road schemes, as he did a few weeks ago, in reality the money is all in one pot. One wonders how the accountants manage to move such sums around. I am always curious, and sceptical, about whether there is extra money or whether it gets lost in the huge sum that is being spent in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Creative accounting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend perhaps goes a little too far. Accounting can prove that money has been spent on specific objects, but whatever the appropriations made, as it is put so carefully in the appropriation order, transfers of money that take place elsewhere are always a matter for concern and for argument. We hope that the money will be used for the purposes for which it has been earmarked and that it will be clearly seen to be extra money, over and above expenditure already decided upon for Northern Ireland as a whole, as well as for roads specifically.<br><br>
Interestingly, the Minister did not speak about whether PFI was being used until challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth). I have been very sceptical about the idea of the PFI since it was first announced. It can only do so much—buying public services on the never never does not appeal to me. The use of PFIs seems to have disappeared for roads. They have been mentioned in the past as a source of finance for the Westlink, for many sewerage works, water works and so on. As well as for education I hope that the Minister will be rather more forthcoming in his reply than he has been hitherto.<br><br>
The Minister dwelt for some time on the Assembly. Massive changes will occur because of it. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be affected by such changes, which will apply to their relationships with the House and its Committees. What will the role of this Committee be next year, when it comes to consider appropriation for Northern Ireland, which is really Northern Ireland's budget? That is a massive question, to which we do not yet know the answer, because the constitutional bill for Northern Ireland has not been made public, unlike those for Scotland and Wales. We are still groping in the dark. Will the Minister explain that a little further today?<br><br>
I turn to two other items, one of which is relatively small. The Minister will note the provision for an extra £1,000 for teacher's superannuation in Department of Education, vote 2. That was made only to make up a shortfall of about £240,000, which arose because of an underestimate of the number of persons retiring through redundancy in the latter part of the year ending March 1997. Hon. Members now again have to contemplate the reduction in class sizes and doing all sorts of wonderful things for education. There does not seem to be much sense in having to find extra money in one year to pay for redundancy and extra money the next year to pay for more teachers. I hope that the Government will in future get their figures a bit more accurate. The £240,000 would be much better spent in the classroom than on pensions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a waste of public resources and grossly unfair to unemployed and qualified young teachers that early retirement is still being paid for out of pension funds and so on? Such early-retired teachers are then re-employed in posts that could be equally well filled by young, qualified teachers who need the opportunity to gain recognition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know about the matter from family experience, as I have a daughter who is training as a teacher. In recent weeks, she and a number of her young friends have made the same point as my hon. Friend, vividly and forcefully. The Minister must keep in mind the anxiety that exists. I have always thought it crazy to retire a man one day and re-employ him the next. It is crazy that he should leave school on Friday and go back into that school or another on a temporary substitution arrangement on Monday morning. That has actually happened. Many such teachers figure that they are just as well off with part-time work as they were with full-time work and that they have a lot more freedom.<br><br>
Most of what I have to say relates to economic development in Northern Ireland and to two or three issues in particular. The first is road transport. As part of yesterday's debate on the Finance Bill, we discussed hydrocarbon duty. Every hon. Member has received letters from the Road Haulage Association in Great Britain, complaining about the cost of fuel. The association draws attention to the great difficulties that that causes and says that instead of a beer run, there will soon be a diesel run. I am afraid that, as usual, Northern Ireland is ahead of Great Britain: the diesel run is already operating there. One does not have to put a 500 or 1,000 gallon tank on a lorry in Northern Ireland—the smugglers are taking care of it. One can buy cut-price diesel and petrol all over the place in Northern Ireland, to the point where the legitimate business man is being forced out of business. It is an absolute scandal. The Revenue has been taking steps to try to control the problem. It is a criminal activity, which is conservatively estimated to cost the Revenue £100 million a year and the money is going into the pockets of criminals.<br><br>
The minister knows that that is not acceptable to me and I hope that it is not acceptable to him—I am sure that it is not acceptable to the Chancellor. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, we saw the same sort of caper in Northern Ireland with cars, which were being brought in from other EEC countries. Again, the land frontier was the problem—it was easy to bring them across. The end result was immense damage to established, legitimate car dealers in Northern Ireland. It is amazing that folk who started out as little better than smugglers have now become highly respected business men running very large garages, while those who complied with the law at that time are often out of business. Will we see the same thing happen to the legitimate fuel supplier in Northern Ireland, or will something serious be done to stop the practice? It is an immense problem, which will not go away.<br><br>
I appreciate that there is a slight trade the other way, because heating fuel is apparently taxed at a higher rate in the Republic than in the north. One can therefore make money both ways, by bringing a load of petrol or diesel to the north and taking a load of heating fuel south. I hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
that the Minister is taking account of that problem. As Dublin is also losing revenue, perhaps the Government there are also taking note.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will no doubt be aware that I tabled eight questions on that very to topic a few weeks ago. He will share my great surprise at the replies, in which Ministers for Departments in Northern Ireland pretty well washed their hands of the matter, saying that it was for the Treasury to deal with. If jobs and businesses in Northern Ireland are going to be lost, surely that is as much a matter for the Minister with responsibility for industrial development as anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I, too, tabled questions and received some interesting answers.<br><br>
Another scam is going on. One or two people have discovered that rather than paying the huge amount of vehicle excise duty that is levied in Northern Ireland, they can simply move their operations to Donegal, Louth or Monaghan. There, they pay the lower rate—several thousand pounds per vehicle in some cases—while still operating throughout Northern Ireland. Quarry owners are doing it and no doubt transport people are doing it, too. I do not know how widespread the practice is, but I know that it is going on. There is not just a loss to the Revenue in Northern Ireland, but an enormous loss of jobs and, presumably, tax. Again, the legitimate, hard-working, honest person in Northern Ireland has suffered. Those loopholes have been opened up by membership of the common market—that is the source of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an uncommon market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is uncommon because there is no commonality of taxation or anything else. We all know the background to the problem, but I am not concerned about that—I am concerned about the effect on the honest citizen in Northern Ireland. I want something done, and I hope that the Minister will tell us exactly what the Government will do.<br><br>
The legal, honest business man is being crushed by the cowboy, the chancer and the guy who is prepared to abuse and misuse the system and the loopholes. It is time that we put a stop to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, despite efforts by many of us to bring the matter to the Government's attention, there is a certain lack of concern about it among Ministers? It would be helpful if they could give us assurances for which the hon. Gentleman is asking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and I am glad to have the hon. Gentleman's support and to see him back in his place. We have missed his wise words on Northern Ireland. Having been brought up there, he at least knows something about the place.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, no matter how frequently we have raised the issue at different levels in the House, all we have got is tokenism and lip service? If the same thing happens as has happened in the past, two additional officers will be appointed when we raise the problem with Customs and Excise and with the Treasury. That is nonsense. It is clear that officers' actions already justify their cost to the public purse thousands of times. We need to tackle criminal activities seriously and to take measures that are clear to the illegal operators, who are prepared to drive over soldiers in the road in pursuit of their illegitimate exploitation of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend reminds us that such activity has already cost the life of one soldier, who was deliberately run down. Heaven only knows how many more lives it will cost. In the light of the behaviour on that occasion, we do not have to ask too many questions to come to a firm conclusion about who benefits most from such behaviour. The terrorist organisations are in it up to the neck and they always have been—even if they were only running a hosepipe across the frontier.<br><br>
Many of my hon. Friends—and, no doubt, Labour Members—want to speak in the debate, so 1 will move on to my next point. Economic development in Northern Ireland has suffered grievously over the years. As a peripheral region, it depends largely on high value-added products, which are easy to transport. For that reason, high-technology products have become attractive in recent years. If one can place products in one or two shoe boxes—as is the case at one or two high-technology factories, such as Seagate—it is not difficult to transport them to the ends of the earth, although 1,000 people could engage in producing them. It seems crazy, but that is how high technology works.<br><br>
One would think that firms producing such products would be attracted to Northern Ireland, with its high-quality education and convenient research facilities. I have always found it astonishing that Coleraine, with its university campus and good educational facilities at all levels, has been passed by. I have always been astonished that so many of the people who have been brought to Northern Ireland by the Industrial Development Board never seem to go more than 10 miles outside Belfast. Opportunities in many other places should be utilised, but that has not happened.<br><br>
I want the Minister to ensure that people who come to the Province are taken to remote areas and advised of the opportunities there, and I understand that the IDB is now making more effort to do that. It should be pointed out that Northern Ireland consists not only of the west bank area of Londonderry and west Belfast but that there are opportunities elsewhere. It is time that my constituency, and especially the Coleraine triangle area, got a slice of the loaf. We do not ask for the cake, just for a fair share—there should be fair dos all round.<br><br>
When the Chancellor was in Northern Ireland recently he announced money for roads and also said that he would fund a science park development to the tune of £10 million. That is good news; there are several places where such funding would be useful. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) will put his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
oar in for a bit more for Antrim and I am glad that there is progress in that town. Coleraine has a favourable atmosphere and the conditions for a science park.<br><br>
The Chancellor did not say where the £10 million would be spent, but I am sure that Northern Ireland Office Ministers have given the matter careful thought; it was clearly left in the hands of the Secretary of State and her junior Ministers. The merits of the Coleraine area are such that it must be the front runner for such investment. The Minister will be aware that the university has worked for many years translating theory and technology into business practice. Indeed, in 1996, the school of biomedical sciences obtained top rating in a research assessment exercise, which says much for the quality of the work being done on the campus. Thankfully, the IDB has zoned 10 acres for high-tech business in Wattstown in the Coleraine area, and the university is also making some of its own land available.<br><br>
Recently, I attended a presentation in Coleraine. It was on the night that the IDB presented its view of the future in Ballycastle, so I went from one to the other. It was an interesting presentation of what can be done by the university and by local business, especially in regard to the incubator units on the Coleraine university site, of which I am sure the Minister is aware. The Minister will also know that in August last year, the local council and the Coleraine borough partnership injected a small sum of money into the establishment of a number of high-tech incubator units on the university site. The intention is to provide a bridge between research in the university and commercial production and that seems to be working; the project is progressing well. It is a perfect site for expenditure of some of the Chancellor's £10 million, as the units are based on the research strengths of the Coleraine campus in life and health technologies. In other words, this is different from Seagate, AVX, chips and other information technology. We have a head start and we should build on it, but it needs an injection of capital into the business, high-technology, science parks to get it off the ground.<br><br>
The groundwork has been done and it is time for the Government to deliver to Coleraine. It would be incredible if the Minister were worried about the project's viability because I am sure that he has been well advised by his officials, but if he is I invite him to put his anxieties to the test by visiting Coleraine university and sitting through the presentation that I attended. He would find it useful, informative and helpful. If the Minister, or any other, cares to come to the university, he would be very welcome, and would go home much encouraged by what is happening on the campus. He could see at first hand what is being done and that there is an opportunity for growth and for new technologies to take off. I hope that he would then see fit to put in the cash that is necessary to move matters from the laboratory to production, thus promoting the health and welfare of people in this country and throughout the world.<br><br>
We have the beginnings of a project that can grow and be successful. I hope that the Minister will take up my invitation to visit as soon as possible.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p>11.5 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank colleagues for the messages of good will and the get well cards that I received during my time off. For those who do not know, I remind the Committee that I narrowly escaped death when I plummeted 50ft to the ground in a paragliding accident. One of my constituency colleagues remarked that I was 10ft short of a by-election, and he was probably right. That I am here at all is a tribute to the national health service, and I have nothing but praise for the nurses and all the other staff who helped me return to full health.<br><br>
It was interesting to watch, from a hospital bed, the momentous events unfolding in Northern Ireland. I was given sedatives during my recuperation, more to calm my agitated political disposition than to alleviate the pain in my back. I add my praise and unequivocal congratulations to all those in this Room who played a part in securing what we all hope will be a lasting and sustainable peace, in the context of a democratic environment, in Northern Ireland. We must all do our best to help that flourish.<br><br>
The £7,000 million that the Northern Ireland Assembly will spend is comparable with the £7,000 million that the Welsh Assembly will be responsible for spending. It seems that democracy is breaking out all over the United Kingdom and, in the medium term, there is no doubt that that will have an impact on the relationship between this Committee and that sum of money. I shall return to that topic.<br><br>
Our discussion is broad-brush, but the Assembly will have to discuss these matters in great detail. Many members of the Committee will have an intimate responsibility for ensuring wise decisions. I wish to raise three issues, in the expectation that in future such matters will be discussed at greater depth in a flourishing Northern Ireland Assembly.<br><br>
First, I agree that Northern Ireland has an enormous opportunity to increase its tourist income and press ahead with economic regeneration by attracting the foreign money that visitors will bring to the area. In general terms, £14 million has been allocated to the Northern Ireland tourist board, and that is good. However, that money is not a panacea to ensure economic recovery in the rural areas. Established industries such as farming must maintain their economic base. I hope that careful consideration will always be given to the limitations of tourism in the context of an economic package.<br><br>
Secondly, I want to bang the drum again for integrated schooling. The £1.5 billion allocated to education in Northern Ireland sounds a great deal but it has to go a long way. I do not think that there is yet sufficient commitment to investing in integrated schooling. I have been challenged by Ministers in exchanges on other occasions to prove the demand for integrated schooling and now that I have returned to the House, I hope to be able to do just that. I also hope that, in the spirit of that challenge, if we can prove that a large proportion of parents would like their children to benefit from an integrated schooling environment, changes will be made to the budget allocations.<br><br>
Thirdly, I echo the concerns of the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) about the PFI. Private finance initiatives are much more expensive in the long
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
term. Like him, I am worried that there will be an overdependence on PFI schemes to deliver the results that we want in Northern Ireland. They are effectively a cash-flow trick that we will pay for in the future. I, too, urge caution before we go headlong into a PFI process that will eventually cost future Administrations a great deal more money. I also stress that it is likely to be the Assembly, rather than the House of Commons, that has to pick up the tab for PFI schemes that are entered into now. I hope that that will be taken into consideration.<br><br>
On health, I we want to check what I think the Minister said implicitly: that Northern Ireland will get its fair share of increased expenditure, on the assumption that the announcement that has been so hailed of an injection of money into the NHS is made on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
I return to the role of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee in the context of the changes in Northern Ireland. We must recognise the diminished role of our debates in future. If we believe in the effectiveness of the Assembly, we must relinquish some of our responsibilities to it. Future debates on appropriations are likely to take much more of an advisory character than they have done in the past. Evidently, we are establishing new etiquettes and new ways of operating as the United Kingdom becomes more of a federation and less of a single unit. It will be exciting to see how that develops. However, that means that for all our respective interests in Northern Ireland affairs, we must stand back a little bit and give the Northern Ireland Assembly the space to make responsible decisions without too much interference from Westminster.<br><br>
In conclusion, we have come an enormously long way. If this is the kind of result that we can expect in Northern Ireland every time that I go off to hospital, I shall have more accidents—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall resist the temptation to respond to those no doubt warm and generous comments from Labour Members.<br><br>
We have been told that democracy has a cost, and the initial cost of the Assembly is £9 million. That is a small cost compared to the cost of an absence of democracy. Ultimately, it is up to the Members of the Assembly to determine their effectiveness in the matters that we have discussed today, but I am sure that we all share the same sentiment: that the clarity with which the people of Northern Ireland spoke shows a genuine willingness to try something new.<br><br>
The Liberal Democrats will unequivocally support the great work undertaken by Ministers, and by those who have courageously fought the case in Northern Ireland. All hon. Members, especially those from Northern Ireland, can be assured that if there is any way in which Liberal Democrat Members can assist with and facilitate the process, we are at their service.</span></p>
<p>11.13 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the remarks by my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry about the disgraceful events that took place in Northern Ireland yesterday evening. They are absolutely disgraceful, and we all condemn them thoroughly. That is certainly not what we want in Northern Ireland, particularly at this time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
I turn to the sections of the appropriations order, and start with the Department of Economic Development vote. In my day, I was a plumber, and served my apprenticeship to that trade in the days when apprenticeships were apprenticeships. We were taught many things in the trade, and that stood those who served their time in good stead in their lives.<br><br>
I draw Ministers' attention to the case of a young man under the new system. He was accepted into a training centre and was excited about getting into a trade. After he had served one year, the training centre managed to find him an approved employer, who was paid according to the system. The young man wanted to continue to study for his level 3 national vocational qualification, but unfortunately the training centre was unable to provide NVQ 3 training.<br><br>
The young man went to work, but the new employer completely ignored the year that he had served at the training centre and insisted on paying him a low starting wage. The employer paid the same amount as he would have paid someone coming in off the street without any training. Apparently, that was acceptable to the training centre.<br><br>
The lad continued to work for the employer, because NVQ 3 was not available at the training centre. However, he then discovered that a technical college offered the course that he wanted. He applied to the college, but the employer said, "Well, you can go on the course if you wish, but I will not pay you." First, the employer, who was approved by the training centre, did not pay the lad properly and, secondly, he would not allow him to get his qualification. The lad was unable to study for the qualification.<br><br>
I know that there are two sides to every question and that those on different sides say different things. However, it was most unfortunate that that lad was put in that position. He was then made redundant. A competent lad was made redundant by an approved employer. He then became a jobseeker and, as such, was obliged to look for work. Although NVQ 3 could have been available to him, he had to find a job. He managed to find a job, but he could not leave it to get his qualifications because the new employer was not interested in letting him do so.<br><br>
I am talking about a training centre, an approved employer, another employer and a lad who is now in limbo in a system that was supposed to assist him but did the opposite. I know that Ministers have some knowledge of this case. Although we do not usually discuss individual cases, I do so this morning to illustrate the fact that systems that are set up for good reasons and provide assistance, which I support, can let young people down because of snags in the system. That is very unfortunate.<br><br>
I shall refer to another case involving welfare to work under vote 5 for the Department of Health and Social Services. I support that system because it is better that those who can work should do so. They should be allowed to work and the state should assist them in whatever way it can. However, unfortunately, the forms are still not quite right for the applicants and claimants. Even under the excellent new scheme of a one-to-one interview, some people lose out because they do not realise that certain things have to be done before a certain time—if they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0634">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
not, they find that they are unable to claim benefits to which they are entitled. No one can do anything about that. Perhaps the Minister would pass that on to some of my colleagues so that they can raise the matter with those concerned.<br><br>
As a member of the Select Committee on Social Security, I strongly supported cracking down on fraud; I knew that there was much fraud in the system and we heard evidence that that was the case. However, under the new disability living allowance operation, it almost seems to be assumed that each applicant is a fraudster—which leads to some ridiculous cases of investigation. We are all protectors of public money: that is our job, but we have to use our common sense, even in working to iron out fraud. I support all those who work in the DHSS. They have a difficult job, particularly those at the sharp end in the social security offices; I condemn the disgraceful threats, from both sides of the community, that are directed at DHSS staff and hope that they cease. I am sure that Ministers do all that they can to help in those situations. Unfortunately, however, even with the best will in the world, there is a perception that applicants for disability living allowance will get an easy ride. That is absolutely not the case.<br><br>
I have a few brief points on the road system and the Department of the Environment. I welcome the money that is coming forward, even though I have reservations about other aspects of the system, as the Minister has just heard. I welcome the Toome bypass, as will my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry. The people in that village deserve great credit from both sides of the community because they have successfully argued their case and worked together. The Minister is also to be congratulated on bringing forward the initiative. Secondly, I support the A26 dualling between my constituency and that of the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley). We regularly have to take that route to the Government offices in Ballymena. It will make life better for everyone, particularly those in business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the support for the Toome bypass. The village is a nightmare to get through at 5 o'clock in the evening. Will my hon. Friend also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the road to the east of that bypass, to the end of the motorway, is not good? It would be sensible to make the connection through to the proposed bypass and to have a dual carriageway from there to the Castledawson roundabout, which is the main link to the north-south route. That was the original scheme for that stretch of road 35 or 40 years ago, when the motorway system was first planned for Northern Ireland, but it was not pursued in the intervening years, which was foolish. It would have been much better to finish the original scheme rather than have the piecemeal expenditure that we have had over many years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention; naturally, I do not disagree with him. Perhaps I should not put words into the Minister's mouth, but I am sure that he will say that once we receive some things, we want a whole lot of other things. A former Northern Ireland Minister told me that in Great Britain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
people were fighting to stop roads being built; in Northern Ireland we are fighting to have roads built. I am sure that the Minister heard what my hon. Friend said and will reply accordingly.<br><br>
I am disappointed that Belfast harbour, which has been held in trust for the people of Belfast—indeed, for the people of Northern Ireland—will be privatised. If, however, the Minister or the Assembly decides to proceed with that, I hope that it will be successful. I think that it is unfortunate and should be watched closely, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) said earlier.<br><br>
I hope for co-operation between the new Assembly and the Scottish Parliament about the road between Stranraer and Carlisle and that the matter will be closely examined.<br><br>
Unfortunately, on some housing estates in Northern Ireland—the same probably applies in the rest of the United Kingdom—residents are tormented, threatened and intimidated by gangsters who deal in drugs and intimidation, among other things. That leads to empty and burnt houses, and to estates becoming notorious. I realise that that is a public order matter, but it is unfortunate. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the problem to some extent, but it should be examined closely. There has been a great exodus of people from some estates, who have, sadly, been driven out by gangsterism. I hope that we can keep that in mind in future.</span></p>
<p>11.27 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put on record my complete abhorrence and total condemnation of those responsible for the attacks on places of worship in Northern Ireland. Those of us who are committed to upholding and securing several religious networks for all condemn what has taken place.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for the opportunity that he gave months ago to me and my colleagues to discuss future expenditure in Northern Ireland, which is always useful.<br><br>
In his opening remarks, the Minster referred to developing the skills and qualifications of young people in Northern Ireland and to how that would contribute to the future prosperity of everyone living there. We agree entirely with that. Bearing that in mind, I appeal to the Minister responsible for education in Northern Ireland to ensure that with the more than £1 billion allocated for expenditure in his Department, he can find ways and means whereby Northern Ireland students are no less favourably treated than their Scottish peers.<br><br>
The Government's discriminatory policy will force English, Welsh and Northern Irish students attending Scottish universities to pay an extra £1,000 to pursue a four-year honours degree course. I hope that the Minister—unlike some of his colleagues, including the Prime Minister—will explain why a student from England, Wales or Northern Ireland should pay £1,000 more in tuition fees than a student from mainland Europe, and why a Northern Ireland student should pay £1,000 more than a student from the Republic of Ireland? It is discrimination plain and simple. I have always been proud to be British because this nation is respected across the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
world for being fair and undiscriminating. This policy goes against everything that this nation, and, more precisely, the Government purport to stand for. the issue goes a long way towards filling my daily mail bag in east Antrim—and the mail bags of other hon. Members.<br><br>
Over the years there has been a strong link between the universities of Scotland and Northern Ireland. There has also, crucially, been a high application rate from Northern Ireland students for places at Scottish universities. Will the Minister confirm that this rate has fallen significantly? I know that it has, because the average Northern Ireland student cannot afford the extra costs. The possibility of an obligatory additional £1,000 for tuition fees means that many students will be denied the privilege of attending a Scottish university.<br><br>
This issue will not go away. It will return to haunt new Labour. The Government must get off the hook on which they are currently caught. The Minister could right this wrong and restore my, and other Members' confidence, and that of the education establishment, including, importantly, the confidence of students. He should avoid a possible waste of public funds on legal costs trying to defend the indefensible. We know how litigious Northern Ireland has been. We remember the debates about people tripping on pavements that led to claims against the Department of the Environment. There are strong feelings on this issue and it is only a matter of time before someone identifies entitlement to legal aid and challenges the Government's decision in the courts as perceived discrimination. I trust that the Minister will put up a fight for Northern Ireland students. Just as a Scottish Office Minister has discriminated in favour of Scottish students, so, within the bounds of available funding, should fair treatment be given to all Northern Ireland students who wish to attend Scottish universities.<br><br>
In view of the sensitivities of Northern Ireland, I remind the Minister and his departmental officials that the closest scrutiny is given to announcements about capital projects. The Minister knows that allocations that seem to be heavily weighted in favour of one side of the community or the other will not seem so if it is clear that funding for capital starts has been allocated on the basis of need. Ministers should ensure that, in the allocation of funds for new capital starts, there is balance and evidence of balance in respect of the distribution of those funds for grammar schools, the controlled sector and the grant-maintained sector.<br><br>
We were all pleased with the Chancellor's announcement about new funding for roads. I, too, took some small comfort from the prospect of £10 million, but, while appreciating that after so long improvements will be made to the A8 Larne-Belfast road, it would be remiss of me not to bring yet again to the attention of Ministers the serious congestion that is occurring between Carrickfergus and Belfast on the A2. It is important that that is dealt with and that the entire road infrastructure in that area is put right. In its present state, it is inhibiting the development of new housing. It is also seriously affecting trade and business, and it may be restricting the attractiveness of the area surrounding Carrickfergus to new inward investment. The sum of £35 million is to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
spent on the west link to improve access to Belfast harbour and, at an early date, adequate investment will have to be made in respect of the road between Carrickfergus and Belfast.</span></p>
<p>11.37 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate being able to take part in the debate. I did not hear about the arson attacks until my colleagues raised the matter. I was travelling this morning and I missed the news. I share their view about such matters. I understand the hopeful attitudes that were adopted in relation to the Assembly. We are told that the amount of money being spent on it is the price of democracy. I have a problem with that, however. The Minister said that it will have to pay its own way in the future and I take that as meaning that the moneys will come from the block budget.<br><br>
I referred to the matter earlier on the Floor of the House, and I wonder whether the Barnett formula has been applied. Given the size of the Northern Ireland Assembly compared with the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament, things seem to be out of kilter. I raised that point when I referred to on-going expenditure and, as we say in ulster, "As you make your bed, you lie on it." Much of the money could haver been used more productively, however, to met social, educational and industrial needs in the Province.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) might have missed a point when he was arguing correctly for funding for students from Northern Ireland who were attending Scottish universities. One of our difficulties is that not enough university places are available in Northern Ireland to meet the demands of our students. Over the years, Scottish and English universities have offered places to young people from Northern Ireland early in the application round. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, so many of those places have been taken. Most departments at our local universities, Queen's and the University of Ulster, have been demanding higher admission standards, so if students are offered the chance to study for a British degree they will take it.<br><br>
The resulting problem—we have raised the matter on the Floor of the House—was not the Government's fault but the result of European legislation. Those coming into the United Kingdom, or into any other European country, from other countries within the European Union, get the same terms for tertiary education as resident students. That, of course, has been to the detriment of the Northern Ireland education budget, where millions of pounds have been spent educating students from outwith the United Kingdom to the detriment of our own students. I have pleaded for extra funds to be given to the education budget to meet the demands of what could be called our local industry.<br><br>
In that context, as we are debating the broad budget appropriations and such matters as our industrial base, I should like to put on record a tribute to the quality of our developing industries. My hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry argues his case for developments around Coleraine, and he is right to urge that we should go down some of those roads, especially when we have a head start. However, we should not overlook the advances
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
that have already been made. I am sure that the Minister of State would have shared my joy if he had been present at the Nortel lunch and demonstration in London on Tuesday; Wales has benefited from the Nortel development, but so has Northern Ireland.<br><br>
One fascinating development is that a modern technology firm in Monkstown is now producing for websites throughout the world. Three hundred fine young graduates are doing research of the highest level there and that is being replicated in other parts of the Province and in other industries. We should not minimise that; we may look back to the old days and think of the industrial base that we had then, but we must now build on our modern industrial base.<br><br>
In that context, I share the views of my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim. The Minister will remember that we raised some of those issues when debating jobseekers and the new deal. It is still rather early to assess what has been happening under the new deal in Northern Ireland. However, I am worried about the awful possibility of approved employers using the system, rather than equipping young people to go into the job market properly trained. I ask the Minister to keep that matter before his officials. Not long ago, I had a session with those from the training and employment departments; I realise that they are seeking to improve matters, but that must be done on the ground.<br><br>
I turn to the Department of Environment vote and the water supply in Northern Ireland. When local government in Northern Ireland was so massively reorganised, much was taken away from local government and subsumed into the Department and many local plans went missing. As a result, we still have a problem with the waste of water, and of the pollution of water supplies. I am not thinking of the sort of pollution that comes from the farming community. I am thinking, for example, of the problem affecting Malone golf club in my constituency, which has existed for some time. Neighbouring residents and those who walk across the club's ground, as well as those who play golf, have been told not to touch the water in the stream because it is polluted. It is strange that after almost two years the source of that pollution, which is a health hazard, cannot be identified.<br><br>
I share with the Minister and others the concern about waste of water and I pay tribute to what is being done in Northern Ireland to minimise that. However, there is another problem. Householders and owners are responsible for the inlet pipes to their properties and the public authority is responsible for water mains.<br><br>
It took the best part of six months to locate one leak in my constituency, and the person who located it said that the cost of repairing it would be higher than the cost of the water being wasted. I took up the matter with the water authority, which rightly repudiated that decision because, in the long run, the cost would mount. The leak was located to a property occupied by pensioners, but it is not known whether it is under the house or in the garden—planners and builders in the past paid no attention to where pipes were laid. The pensioners face the undisclosed cost of repairing the leak with no help available.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim is a master plumber, but my father was a real plumber. My first Sunday job was to help him with a job at a spinning mill where I acted as plumber's mate. It is unfair to ask people with limited incomes to bear the high cost of repairing a leak which might be under the house or in the garden, and perhaps the matter could be examined.<br><br>
I referred earlier to roads and the Minister is aware of my concern. The grant has been announced and plans seem to be well advanced. People on the Donegal' road and broadway did not complain about a flyover, as they did at Knock. The Blackstaff river and high pylons on the surface, increased the cost of erecting a flyover, so those concerned were left with a wide roundabout which quickly became a bottleneck and has had an adverse impact on many of the humbler people who already lived in dismal conditions in that part of south Belfast. A delay on that stretch of road adds to the associated costs. That little stretch of water and the associated problems that have developed over the years mean that the cost of exporting from Northern Ireland is already high enough. We should push ahead with the scheme—it should be ready to start by 1999–2000, or even before the end of 1998–99, although I realise that I may be hoping for too much when I press for the earlier date.<br><br>
Disability living allowance was mentioned earlier, and the House of Commons has already heard of scandals in that regard. It is important to deal with fraud—some people make false statements, which are not properly examined, and others, who are honest and who do their best to be as independent as possible, are penalised. I have seen medical forms on which the medical examiner has made erroneous or terse comments—although, thankfully, we have won such cases on appeal. A war veteran said that he could do a couple of hundred metres, but he failed to say that he often had to rest or have a snack at a cafe before continuing his journey. However the medical examiner stated on the medical form that the veteran could do 800 metres without any problem. Such cases destroy confidence in the system and are demeaning to the applicant, who has a right to help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that when officials make home visits to assess applicants—especially the elderly—for benefit, they should be given clear guidance? In general, pensioners are so independent that they leave officials with the impression that they are competent and capable of doing everything for themselves. They will not admit to the help that they receive from family or neighbours, and wrong decisions are consequently made. A member of the family should, where possible, be present when a pensioner applicant is interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. That problem has been going on for years. A phrase is used in this connection—doing the rounds of the kitchen. An old women might be asked, "Can you manage to move around unaided?", and she would reply. "I can", when in reality she could not. The situation must be handled sensitively.<br><br>
I do not for one moment want to diminish the spirit of sturdy independence—if we take that away from people, we demean them and could push them down the road of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
rapid decline—but neither in Northern Ireland nor in any other part of the United Kingdom should we rely completely on kindly neighbours who do what they can to help individuals. Giving such help is the proper way of life, but we should provide appropriate help to individuals.<br><br>
In that context, it is a matter of interpreting law. An occupational therapist visited a constituent of mine who lives in a house with an outside toilet. The only heating is an electric fire—the most expensive form of heating. Due to the condition of my constituent's health, it was recognised that she needed economy 7 heating. But the law says that if a person can handle an appliance—she could press the switch—then he or she does not quality. But the electric fire does not provide enough warmth and, when she moves rooms, there is no warmth at all. I know that the Minister concerned was worried abut the situation, but we need a more sensitive approach to interpreting the law, even if it means amending it.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to ask the Minister about the private finance initiative. I appreciate that some people are looking for a killing. Businesses hope to get in on a scheme and, if it has good prospects, go for it, especially when it involves land. One health establishment has valued its 60-odd acres of land at £1 million. Not many miles from there, four acres of bad land were sold in a public auction for £1.1 million. I know that people would be prepared to participate in PFIs.<br><br>
Before I ask specific questions, I want to pay tribute to the PFIs that have helped to develop research work in hospitals, in particular the cancer facilities in Belfast City hospital—now a European centre of excellence—which provides tissue types for Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, Europe and America. I welcome the tremendous advances that it has made.<br><br>
I am concerned, however, about the development of schools. There is no public secondary school in inner south Belfast. There were at least two. One was moved from Lisburn road to Annadale on the Ormeau road, where it was called Deramore. It was run down and transferred to a site at Larkfield, which is on the periphery of south Belfast. The other school, Kelvin, was closed and moved from Grosvenor road, Roden street, in the Donegall road area to Larkfield where it became Balmoral high.<br><br>
There is a rumour that a business man is prepared to build a secondary school in inner south Belfast. Is there a PFI to encourage that or is there a PH pending to improve Balmoral high? How close are we to using a PFI to replace Wellington college, where people have been living and working for years in sub-standard conditions, with modern buildings? My information is that bids had to be submitted by the end of June before being sent to the Department of Finance, and that if the Department did not agree with the figures, the bid would go back into the melting pot. In the meantime, young people have been attending Wellington college and doing remarkably well. They were promised a new building to unify the old Annadale boys' grammar school and Carolan girls' schools. They are on the site vacated by Deramore, where there has been a problem of asbestos. About five years
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
ago, the Belfast Education and Library Board made the college one of its priorities—I think that it was fourth—but then the Department lowered its position to about eighth. How soon can we expect to see building in progress on the Wellington college site to provide the accommodation that is necessary for modern education to equip our young people to face the challenges of the 20th century?</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I noticed how eloquently the Minister spoke this morning and how he waxed when he spoke about the new Northern Ireland Assembly and the wonderful increase in expenditure on Northern Ireland. During the election, I listened to the video reports of what the various candidates were saying and noticed that they all promised the electorate the world—no hospital services were to be reduced, every road would be approved and everybody would be kept wonderfully happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that not simply prove to us all how normal Northern Ireland and its politicians have become? [<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is some reality in that. When politicians go to the people, they always promise them what they want; that is human nature. However, now that we have the new Assembly in Northern Ireland, it will have to deal with the reality, and I am afraid that the reality is somewhat different from people's expectations. The Minister enthusiastically welcomed the new Assembly, but I am not as keen as he is. I do not understand how an assembly, or indeed any parliament, can run a country on the basis of consensus. Imagine what the Chamber would be like if every decision had to be reached by consensus between Labour, Conservative and Liberal Members—we would all be sitting there a long time, and taking any difficult decisions would be problem. I am afraid that that will happen in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Indeed, I happened to be in the 1973 Assembly when we had an Executive for, thankfully, a short time. We were told that it would announce a wonderful economic programme to solve all Northern Ireland's problems. Then we discovered that its members could not agree. the announcement wa put back and back, and was never made. Because of the nature of the parties, it was very difficult to reach and agreement.<br><br>
I am not confident about the New Assembly because it is undemocratic. If the Ulster Unionist party goes to the country with a policy that it believes is good for the welfare of Northern Ireland, it will not be able to carry it out because it will not have the power to do so. Everything must be brought down and levelled out by consensus. That is not a good way to run any Government, nor is it practical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point. On balance, would he prefer me or his right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) to take decisions on Northern Ireland's financial priorities?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get involved in the question of personalities. Nor do I want to say that the Minister is the best person to take the decision. However, because he is part of an Executive that will curtail his policies and aims in order that agreement might be reached, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party will be unable to take the decisions that the Minister currently takes. Any Minister whose policy has the endorsement of the people should have the right to take such a decision.<br><br>
I turn now to Northern Ireland estimates. As a new Member of Parliament, one tries to reconcile figures. It is especially important to try to understand the financial situation in Northern Ireland, and the connection between votes and reality. We are told that extra money is available here and available there. However, it is difficult to see where the money is to come from. Is it to be drawn from existing estimates, or is it new and additional?<br><br>
On 11 December, Committee members were told that the total figure for Northern Ireland is £8,289 million. When £926 million is deducted from that figure, £7,363 million is left for Northern Ireland Departments. In respect of Northern Ireland estimates, £7,475 million is allocated to Northern Ireland Departments. that leave £112 million apparently unaccounted for. Can the Minister explain that discrepancy?<br><br>
We were also told that extra money was available for health, personal social services and education, and that that money was to be drawn from the reserve fund. The July budget set aside £27.6 million for schools and £31.1 million for health. Are those sums included in the estimates? One assumes that they are not, given that they are drawn from the reserve fund.<br><br>
We were further told that £36 million would be provided for the new deal for the young and long-term unemployed. Is the £36 million welfare-to-work programme included in that estimate?<br><br>
According to figures given in the booklet, the provision for last year was £6,721 million, of which the outturn was £6,555 million. The estimates are cash limited and apply to a large section of the Northern Ireland budget. Do those estimates include spending on the environment? Was that money saved because social security spending, which is not cash limited, proved to be less than was originally estimated? We need clarification of that matter.<br><br>
Total provision last year was £6,721 million whereas the provision this year is £6,780 million. This year's estimates therefore seem to represent only an increase of about £60 million—or £59 million—on last year's. Will the Minister explain whether the figure of 4 per cent. that he mentioned is based on the outturn of last year or the estimates for last year?<br><br>
As regards agriculture, everyone in Northern Ireland welcomes the fact that we can now export beef again. The fact that the first consignment has left is especially welcome. Those who consumed Northern Ireland beef in the past found that it was very good beef and are willing to eat Northern Ireland beef again. A marketing programme will take place and, not withstanding the high value of the pound in terms of exports, we hope that in the near future beef exports will increase and reach the level that they attained before the beef crisis arose.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
Those of us in Northern Ireland would also like the date-based system to come into operation as quickly as possible. A number of farmers have flagged herds and find it difficult to sell their beef stock—nobody wants to buy stock from a flagged herd. Given the fact that Northern Ireland farmers entered the scheme early—or, in other words, that they are back to exporting beef—perhaps they might also benefit early from the date-based scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that the flagging of some farmers' herds cannot by any logic be justified? A constituent of mine who sold a calf at a week old had his herd flagged because eight years later that calf turned out to have BSE. But there is no way that that man could have had any influence over the feeding, care or treatment of that animal after it left his farm at a week old. The flagging of his herd was therefore completely unjustified. Can something be done about that aspect of the problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. Some of these occurrences are the result of the agreement made with Europe—the number of flagged herds has increased in order to allow farmers to export beef again, and that has led to anomalies. The sooner that the problem is solved, the better.<br><br>
The serious farming difficulties experienced in the United Kingdom as a whole have had a greater effect on Northern Ireland because of its dependence on agriculture. Farm incomes have reduced drastically and the pig and poultry industries are experiencing severe problems. Every aspect of farming seems to be afflicted with problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the pig industry. May I suggest to him that it is important to make an early decision about support for the replacement of the pork-processing factory in Ballymoney? That factory was important for the pig industry in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The matter to which he referred also hurts me. The factory, which was destroyed by fire on 20 June, was taking about 40 per cent. of the pigs slaughtered in Northern Ireland. The Minister stated that Department of Agriculture staff was visiting the plant and that the Industrial Development Board was doing everything possible to ensure that the factory was rebuilt. Will the Minister update the Committee about developments in that matter?<br><br>
Problems in agriculture have an effect on business throughout Northern Ireland. When I was in business, I was well aware that when farmers did badly, so did everyone else, because of the strength of the farming industry in Northern Ireland. Ulster Unionist Members hope that the situation will improve and that the value of the pound will go down. That would make life easier for farmers, whose incomes might then return to reasonable levels.<br><br>
The provision for the Department of Agriculture in 1997–98 was £159 million; the provisional estimate for this year is £130 million, which seems a considerable decrease. Will the Minister explain that?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
Turning to the estimates for the Department of the Environment, I note that last year there was a provision of £182 million for road transport and ports, but that the amount this year is £173 million. That also seems to be a reduction. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether the new money that has been announced by the Chancellor is additional to the estimates? Furthermore, does the provision for this year include the £12 million that will be spent on the road between Ballygawley and Londonderry—in my constituency?<br><br>
Provision for education in 1997–98 was £1,396 million; this year it will be £1,403 million. That increase seems rather small. It will not cover inflation, and yet we are told that there are additional moneys for schools. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that £9 million would be spent on new integrated schools. Will the Minister reconcile all these figures? It seems that there will be no great increase, despite what he said.<br><br>
Last year, the provision for the Department of Health and Social Services was £1,566 billion. The provision this year is £1,601 billion, which seems to be an increase of about £35 million. Again, the percentage increase seems to be small, perhaps only taking account of inflation. I hope that the Minister will respond to our questions on these important matters when he replies to the debate. Perhaps he will clarify that the supplementary estimates take care of the additional money that we were promised.<br><br>
I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, south said about the disability living allowance. In Northern Ireland, going in and telling a pack of lies succeeds; telling the truth is apt not to succeed. A review of the disability living allowance is needed so that only those who qualify and really need it get it, because when the scheme is abused, the person who has a genuine disability loses out.<br><br>
The estimates show that Northern Ireland benefits from being an integral part of the United Kingdom. The Minister is from Wales, which he will agree benefits greatly from being part of the United Kingdom. We should be proud of being part of the United Kingdom, not ashamed of it. Just like Wales and Scotland, we benefit from being part of the greater part of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The Minister spoke enthusiastically about events in the Republic of Ireland and about how well it is doing. He seemed to imply that we are not doing as well. I am not especially worried about what the economy of the Republic of Ireland is doing; I suspect that many of its claims are merely boasts and that it has been dependent on hand-outs from the European common market, given that it is a small nation. It is putting a poor mouth on it, and putting out the begging bowl, as it always does. I am sure that it benefits from Europe. Whether it will continue to do so remains to be seen, given Europe's future expansion. Furthermore, the decision of the Republic of Ireland to sign up to the central currency may not be to its advantage in the long run.<br><br>
I am happy if my fortunes rise and fall with the rest of the United Kingdom and I am proud to be a member of it. I hope that it will long continue.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<p>12.24 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss (North-East Cambridgeshire)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by welcoming back the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik). He always makes thoughtful and telling contributions to the Committee, although this morning his uncritical praise of Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office stepped beyond the boundaries of his usual generosity. It is nice to see him in the Committee again.<br><br>
In his opening remarks, the Minister touched on the Assembly's role in Northern Ireland. I want to add my comments to those that have already been made and to welcome the auspicious start that the Assembly made yesterday. Conservative Members wish it every success for the future and congratulate the Government and Ministers for all the work and endeavour that they have put in to ensure that it at least made a successful start.<br><br>
The Assembly's role comes into question in relation to this Committee's working and future role. I wonder whether this is the last time the Committee will debate the appropriation order for Northern Ireland. Will the Minister confirm whether the Assembly will mirror the working of Government Departments, with the aim of taking over their responsibilities early next year? If so, I assume that it will set the budget of the Departments for which it is responsible from the start of the new financial year in 1999. In future, the expenditure that we are considering today—some has already been voted through, although there is additional expenditure for the balance of the financial year—and the headings under which it comes will be the responsibility of Members of the Assembly. It seems that the role of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs will become more important and that that of the Grand Committee will diminish as a result.<br><br>
I want to ask a few questions about the details and I start with the Department of Economic Development. The £40 million that the Minister mentioned with regard to tourism is welcome. Given peace and a settlement, there can be rapid expansion in tourism in the area. That is true not only of its contribution to gross domestic product in Northern Ireland but in terms of jobs. However, I would add the proviso that it is more than important that the money goes into training people to take on roles and jobs within the tourist industry. Only in the medium term will we benefit from people going back to Northern Ireland because they get a good service when they go there on holiday. Investment in training is a vital component of investment in tourism.<br><br>
Under the same paragraph heading, we have assistance to the gas and electricity industries. I would be grateful if the Minister could give the Committee an update on the progress that has been made on the provision of gas to Belfast and on whether it is running to schedule. How much Government money is being made available to the gas industry to facilitate provision? What is the latest position regarding gas and electricity interconnectors, which come ashore at Island Magee?<br><br>
On the Department of the Environment vote, the Minister mentioned £20 million for road passenger services. I am not terribly familiar with that term, so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
perhaps the Minister could clarify it. It might mean buses, for all I know. It would be helpful to know what the £20 million is to be spent on.<br><br>
As regards the road programme, we were grateful to the Minister, for itemising, during the questions to him, where the £87 million that the Chancellor promised will be invested. He gave us a useful breakdown. Will the Minister who replies to the debate give the Committee some idea of whether the £10 million that is earmarked for the A8—the Belfast-Larne road—will provide for dualling along the length of it, which is what local Members of Parliament want? Or will the money provide only for road improvements to increase road safety and the throughput of traffic? I am not sure whether £10 million will be sufficient to dual the whole length of the road. The same question can be posed regarding the A1 improvement, for which the amount is £15 million. In the case of the A26, I assume that the figure of £7 million relates to the complete extension of the dualling up to Ballymena, which was in the programme during my time but eventually had to be dropped. I do not believe that the sum of £12 million for the A5 improvement will be sufficient to dual its length from Londonderry to Ballygawley. A detailed breakdown of how the money is to be spent would be helpful for the Committee and for people in Northern Ireland. It is assumed that many of the roads concerned are to be dualled, but I suspect that the sums involved will not allow for that. Will the Minister confirm whether that is so?<br><br>
The order refers to expenditure by the Department of the Environment on ferry services. Will the Minister explain the position with regard to the Strangford ferry? The provision of a new ferry through the private finance initiative route was proposed some time ago. Has that proposal now been abandoned, and if so will a new ferry be provided using public money?<br><br>
I read recently in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> a scathing report about the poor quality of the service and the rolling stock on Northern Ireland's railways—it was a few weeks ago. The new rolling stock does not appear to have arrived. I realise that the transport holding company had financial pressures, which may not have been alleviated. The rolling stock was to have been provided, again, by PFI. Is that still to be the case, or are the Government now proposing that it will be provided through public expenditure?<br><br>
With regard to infrastructure improvements, will the Minister tell the Committee about the position regarding the Antrim-Bleach Green section upgrade? Is it due to be completed on time and to cost? The improvements to the line between Belfast and Lisburn have held up the introduction of the new express service—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For many years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, for many years. What stage has been reached there? The line was deemed to be inferior—there was a problem that was not detected early enough and the hon. Gentleman was very much on the ball in pointing that out some time ago. Additional moneys are required to improve the line, which is crucial for the running of the new express service from Belfast to Dublin. Will the Minister explain the current position?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
In his opening remarks, the Minister highlighted the high priority that must be given to the improvement of Northern Ireland's sewerage and water supply systems, which are a capital time bomb. We have fallen behind with the infrastructure improvements required, especially in the sewerage system and the quality of water emissions into coastal waters. Unlike with other areas of expenditure that will be taken over by the Assembly, infraction proceedings could be instituted by the European Commission if the standards and requirements laid down by European legislation are not met. That is a problem and members of the new Assembly are going to have something of a shock when they come to deal with it.<br><br>
The solution lies in a complete revamping of the charging system for water services in Northern Ireland. Some local hon. Members will perhaps disagree with me on that, because it will mean higher water charges across the board and, probably, the linkage with rates being disconnected, so that charging is more in line with that in England and Wales. At the end of the day, it seems that the only means of gaining access to the capital moneys necessary to do the work in the timescale required to meet European standards is for thought to be given to privatisation of the water industry in Northern Ireland. Unless the law on public expenditure and on the borrowing of money by bodies such as the water services changes significantly and fundamentally, which is not likely even under the new Labour Government, the only recourse to substantial amounts of capital is through the private sector in one form or another. It would be interesting to hear what the Minister thinks is likely to happen and what the Government have in mind to solve the problem.<br><br>
Vote 5 under the Department of the Environment section deals with expenditure on fire and related services. The terrible fire at the Parliament building at Stormont occurred under the previous Government. The renovation work is now being completed. A programme of analysis was instigated throughout all Government buildings in Northern Ireland, to ensure that they had the proper fire certificates. A programme was set out for that work. Will the Minister confirm whether all fire certificates have been issued to all relevant Government buildings within the timescale in that programme?<br><br>
An order on Government proposals for education in Northern Ireland will be debated in Committee this afternoon. It is appropriate to put most relevant questions to the Minister then. In his opening remarks, however, the Minister mentioned an increase of 3 per cent. in expenditure on education and a 2.3 per cent. increase in expenditure on health and social services. He did not say, however, whether those were cash or real-terms increases.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) analysed and broke down the figures and was also concerned whether the increase in health expenditure had any substance. He spoke of a small increase; the Minister spoke of a 2.3 per cent. increase. If that increase is not in real terms, it will go nowhere, like any increase that is less than inflation. We all know that inflation in the health service is higher than the average measure for inflation throughout the economy. The additional health expenditure must be at least a real-terms increase. A more meaningful figure would be the increase in terms of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
inflation in the health sector. If the Committee were given that figure, it would be able to see whether extra money was going into health during the next few months.<br><br>
Health is one of the prime responsibilities of the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who is to reply. Perhaps, therefore, I can be a little more probing than usual, as he will have all of the answers at his fingertips and will not necessarily need to reply on the excellent advice coming from behind him.<br><br>
I was surprised to read an article in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> the other day, which was written, I think, by a surgeon from the Royal Victoria hospital. As I read the article, I began to think that cancer services, and the new cancer services, were now to be provided by that hospital, which is counter to what we had been led to expect—it was certainly counter to the proposals that I had instigated when I was Minister with responsibility for health. Obviously, some surgery on cancer patients will be done at the Royal, and no doubt the Minister is as much in control of the Royal's public relations as 1 ever was—it is certainly a law unto itself. It was disquieting to read the article and the fact that it was not countered by the Department added to the impression that the Royal was indeed going to be the centre for such services. Will the Minister confirm that the City hospital will be the centre for cancer services? Over what period will the facilities now provided at Belvoir Park be run down and transferred to the City hospital? Considerable capital investment will be required at the City site: how much money will be needed to upgrade the City hospital to take over cancer services?<br><br>
On page 7 of the order, details are given of the sums involved in expenditure by the Department of Health and Social Services. Item 1 lists expenditure on
<br><blockquote><p>"hospital, community health and personal social services",</p></blockquote>
and so on. Does that include capital expenditure as well as revenue expenditure? If so, a breakdown of how much of the total is capital expenditure and how much revenue expenditure would be helpful. I and other hon. Members should be grateful if the Minister could supply, at a later date, a written breakdown of where the capital expenditure is going in the current year.<br><br>
I shall end with two short questions. First, will the Minister give an update on the likely completion of Causeway hospital? Also, will he bring the Committee up to date about Banbridge, where a polyclinic has been opened against local opposition? Most closures of local hospitals meet with such opposition, but what is happening with the land occupied by the previous hospital? Has it been disposed of, or is that yet to happen? Has a valuation been placed on it? Has some agreement been reached with the local community about how the proceeds of that land sale should be used?<br><br>
Secondly, I realise that the Minister had to make a difficult decision about the Downe hospital. The population of south down is probably united against him at present. The Downe hospital will be a community hospital, as all the acute services will be removed, but am I right that there will be no maternity provision? That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
would mean that women from south Down will have to go to Lisburn or the nearest maternity unit to have their babies.<br><br>
That would be a retrograde step for the people of Downpatrick. At one stage they had been led to believe that the maternity hospital facility would provide the basis for an upgraded local hospital. However, they have now been told that all that has changed and they will have a community hospital instead. I do not deny for a moment that community hospitals are important, but local people have suffered a turn round in their expectations.</span></p>
<p>12.43 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to answer all questions within 17 minutes, Mr. Atkinson.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Forty five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I will do my best.<br><br>
First, I join other hon. Members in welcoming back the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. He has been missed, as he has made a considerable contribution to Northern Ireland matters. If he wishes to defy gravity in future, may I commend to him the services of the Ulster gliding club? I can testify that its members can take one off the earth and back safely: I think that the hon. Gentleman would enjoy the experience.<br><br>
I also join other hon. Members in condemning the arson attacks on at least eight Roman Catholic churches last night. They were not incidental attacks; clearly, they were throughout Northern Ireland. They were planned by as yet unknown people, who are the utter enemies of any kind of democracy or civilised behaviour. I am sure that all hon. Members agree that we must stand up to such intimidation.<br><br>
It has been an interesting debate in several respects. One is the fact that although we have been going since 10 am, the word "cuts" has not yet been used. It used to be the commonest word in the Northern Ireland Grand Committee's debates on appropriation orders under the previous Government, because we were seeing a diminution in services. Today, we have been going for two and three quarter hours, yet that word has not been used all. Instead, hon. Members have been saying that they want services developed further and, legitimately, making points about their own constituencies. That is significant.<br><br>
Another interesting thing is that although there will be a future role for the Grand Committee, the responsibility for all these matters will lie with the Assembly. When Opposition members say, "What are you going to do about this?", it is sometimes tempting to turn the question round and ask what they will do. They will shortly have to face all the commitments that they made in their election manifestos.<br><br>
It seems appropriate to deal first with the future role of this Committee. In accordance with paragraph 33(c) of strand one of the agreement, should there be any need in the future to consider draft appropriation orders, the Grand Committee will continue to be a central vehicle for hon. Members to debate and scrutinise them.<br><br>

We obviously welcome the congratulations of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) and others on setting up the Assembly. It is a key change. I do not share the despondency of the hon. Member for West Tyrone on that. Any Parliament seeks to allocate resources fairly. A Parliament that did not, over a long period, allocate fairly on the basis of need would sow the seeds of its own destruction. One would want to see in all the parties' manifestos that underlying fairness, which justifies democratic politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This hon. Gentleman mentioned briefly the role that this Committee might have. What role will the Select Committee on Northern Ireland have with regard to financial matters? Will the chief executives and Ministers of the Northern Ireland Assembly have to appear before it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of these things are still evolving and will continue to evolve. The Select Committee on Northern Ireland will continue and will be a major forum in which those who are elected to this Parliament will be able to take up their responsibilities for affairs in Northern Ireland—I do not see that being dramatically altered. However, the parties in Northern Ireland will want to think about that and about the allocation of responsibilities between their members in the House of Commons and elsewhere. As the agreement works itself out, the roles of the Grand Committee and the Select Committee will become clearer.<br><br>
I shall try to deal with the various issues in the order that they were raised. Where points were made by more than one hon. Member, or where hon. Members made the same point several times, I shall link them up.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry and several other hon. Members spoke about the private finance initiative. The Government believe that there is a role for private finance in public projects. One reason for our looking for private finance in the past was that some public projects had been badly managed. Some pretty scandalous examples of escalating costs and extremely slow development of hospital building projects have resulted in poor value for money in developing them. The Northern Ireland Office has examined the PFI generally, and where it works well and gives good value for money, the Government will use it.<br><br>
There have been clear-cut simple examples of regular amounts of capital investment being needed to keep equipment up to date. The Government will introduce the national grid for learning in schools. Members may have seen ancient personal computers—some of them at least 15 years old—on visits to some schools. Because of the way in which schools have been equipped in the past, somehow children have had a raw deal when modern equipment has been supplied. Ministers have had to think carefully about what could be afforded from each year's budget. Our commitment to connect all schools, colleges and libraries to the internet and to the resources of information technology has a clear link with the PFI.<br><br>
That is clear cut; many issues are not. It would be difficult to attract the private sector and make gains from the building of a small primary school. But there are other instances in Northern Ireland where PFI would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
useful—such as making three schools into one, or three into two, which would be a proper use of resources. In education, we are at the ultimate stage with signing off the North-West institute for Further and Higher education, for which we used the PFI. The hon. Member for Belfast South, spoke of PFIs in, or near, his constituency. I shall come back to him with details. On the schools PFI, we should be able to say firmly within two to three months whether they constitute value for money and whether we can go ahead. I shall communicate with the hon. Gentleman on the specific projects that he raised, if he wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's offer to come back on those specific projects. However, if they do not work out, will they be put further down the list, or will they keep their place in the strategy list and have public funding?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One problem with the PFI is that sometimes it makes most sense to use it for low priority building projects. However, we have avoided that, because we feel that it makes more sense to use it only for high priority projects, so that if the PFI is not appropriate such projects would not be put back down the list. There would clearly be some priority with an educational building programme because it would have been selected on the basis of need. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman. We could not start immediately on an orthodox building programme there, but these—and Wellington college in particular—are clearly high priority projects, whichever way we fund them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry spoke about redundancy payments and the re-employment of teachers. We have examined this matter closely because there have been past abuses. I am informed that there are now far fewer cases of people who have been declared redundant being taken on. Sometimes it has happened for short-term purposes such as helping a class to complete a course with the same teacher when the redundancy occurred earlier in the year. I would look with great disfavour on people making money out of redundancy packages and continuing in the same job. That would not be fair on the education system or on young teachers looking for jobs. If such instances arise, I should be only too pleased to examine then.<br><br>
Several hon. Members raised the issue of smuggling. I shall convey to the Chancellor the unease that hon. Members have expressed about the threat that such abuse poses to legitimate industry, although it is not a matter for which I usually have responsibility.<br><br>
I shall, once again, visit Coleraine and, once again, enjoy the visit. The hon. Member for East Londonderry is most anxious that I should repeatedly visit Coleraine—I do, and I shall. He eloquently made the case that the science park should be located at Coleraine. The Chancellor's package made available £10 million for a science park. It is for the two universities, individually or collectively, to make their case for the science park being on one of their campuses or on a completely new campus. We cannot regard such initiatives as a one-off because £10 million is available on this occasion; they must be

part of a continuing programme. I assure Opposition Members that I am aware of the important role that research plays in Northern Ireland. The two universities must improve their research performance, and the Government must do all that they can to assist in that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire raised the issue of tourism. We certainly recognise the importance of that issue; it is good to see tangible examples of the more settled atmosphere helping tourism—for example, the building of hotels. Earlier this year, a 51-bedroom hotel, Newry Canal Court, opened for business, creating 100 full and part-time jobs. The development of the 185-bedroomed Hilton International at Belfast Laganside and the proposed 130-bedroom Stakis hotel and golf resort at TemplePatrick, alongside the more settled political atmosphere, send out a message whereby people outside will realise the enormous potential of the area.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire quite rightly raised the important issue of integrated schooling. In public opinion polls, a significant number of people express sympathy for the idea of integrated schooling. However, arguing in favour of it is different from registering that opinion such that people take account of it. We lowered the criteria for secondary schools this year, from 100 pupils a year to 80, which was welcomed by the integrated school movement. We still want to put the emphasis on transforming schools. Demands on resources for more schools in Northern Ireland are such that it is inevitably more difficult to do, and opposition is expressed when people realise that resources that could be used elsewhere are going into integrated schools. Transformation is important. Another batch of integrated schools is likely to be confirmed later this year. I have set up, and am chairman of, a working party on integrated schools, which aims to work out a strategy that is fair to both integrated and non-integrated schools. It is encouraging that people from all sections of the schools movement, not only fans of integrated schools, are on that working party; that means that we can do things transparently. There are representatives of the transferrers—the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which has not been agitating for integrated schools. I welcome its statement that it wants more than just the building of integrated schools; it also wants the development of education for mutual understanding, which is encouraging. There are more ways of achieving integration and peaceful coalescence or co-operation than just by opening integrated schools.<br><br>
In response to what has recently been said about extra money for health, I say simply that that will read across to Northern Ireland and we shall also benefit. We have already done a considerable amount to improve the health service, by putting in extra resources last year. I am pleased that we have managed to get waiting lists in Northern Ireland on a downward trend, from the beginning of the year. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire will remember the three per cent. cuts in the Budget for which his Government were responsible and which led to a soaring of the waiting lists. In the words of the Secretary of State for Health, we do not have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
a big supertanker to turn round, but we have managed to turn around the vessel that we have, so that there are now fewer people on waiting lists than when we were elected.<br><br>
Several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for South Antrim, raised the issue of the disability living allowance. That is an important issue. Hon. Members will recall the introduction of the benefit integrity project in Britain, which attracted much criticism and media interest, with people who should transparently have continued receiving DLA having it cut. We have tried to go about that in a different way in Northern Ireland, through not a benefit integrity project but a benefit validation project. We do not want to convey the message of the integrity project that people's integrity is under suspicion, but we have to acknowledge that significantly more people collect DLA in Northern Ireland than elsewhere—without any apparent reason. The claims may all be valid, but we must make sure.<br><br>
We all agree that benefit must go to those who need it. Members of our Committee feel annoyance about the issue because they know of cases where people receive the allowance without being entitled to it. We have been talking to the disability organisations to try to get them on our side and have been successful in that regard. We would be only too pleased to ask the Social Security Agency to check individual cases. It is important not only that people realise that it is valid to support the work of the agency, but that the benefit goes to the people who need it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Antrim raised the important issue of training. He referred to the discrepancies between those who go to training centres and those who go to further education colleges, and to the fact that those who take one route cannot study for level 3 national vocational qualifications. He also referred to wages. One of our reasons for bringing together education and training within the same Ministry, under my influence, was to examine such issues.<br><br>
During the past year, a working party has considered the relationship between FE colleges and regional training centres, which are run by the Training and Employment Agency. In the next fortnight or so, we expect to publish a discussion paper on that relationship because much annoyance is caused by the fact that different conditions apply. There is a lack of credibility in that Northern Ireland has two further education systems: the FE college system and the regional training system. Our investigations have shown great overlap, wasted capacity and inefficient use of resources.<br><br>
Although that is not a full response to the queries about training by the hon. Member for South Antrim, I hope that I have assured him that we are tackling the issue as vigorously as possible. As I have said, a discussion paper should be published in about a fortnight, and everyone will be able to respond to it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Antrim mentioned the scourge of drug taking and its impact. Of course, it is not just a matter of dealing with that; we must tackle the problems of dilapidated estates with vacant premises. He will have been pleased that the Chancellor's package included £11 million to improve run-down housing estates. In the end, it comes down to everyone working
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0644">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
together. The hon. Gentleman said that drug taking is a public order issue, but it is not only a public order issue; a fair amount of community development and investment is needed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Antrim mentioned the Belfast harbour privatisation, as did other hon. Members. There is a link between that privatisation and the Chancellor's package. The harbour does not have to be sold before the Chancellor's package comes into operation. However, the receipts of that sale are anticipated in the Chancellor's package, so that is in a sense money on account. That must be borne in mind. Other hon. Members referred to other privatisations. I watched with great interest and alarm the privatisation of the Clyde port authority, when people made large amounts of money for no good reason and without merit. The Government will watch and control the Belfast harbour privatisation, and there will be public involvement so that we avoid the mistakes that other Governments have made when selling off public assets.<br><br>
I noted the points that the hon. Member for South Antrim made about the virtues that will come through what I still call the council of the isles, such as the linking of road networks between Scotland and Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I shall now deal with the point made by the hon. Member for another part of Antrim—[HON. MEMBERS: "East".] Yes, the hon. Member for East Antrim. Before I leave this post, I shall take a test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Geography O-level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps.<br><br>
I say this gently—it was disappointing that the hon. Member for East Antrim did not mention amounts when talking about school capital. Last year, we were debating a schools capital programme of the order of £26 million—it having been heavily slashed. This year,. we are talking about a schools capital building programme of about £80 million. That is the contrast.<br><br>
Obviously, we seek a balance between different parts of the package. Within that package, there is investment in the controlled, the maintained, the Irish-medium and the integrated sectors. When the hon. Member for East Antrim said that he thought that there was an imbalance, he was referring only to part of the package. In the part with which I dealt earlier this year, which involved the relatively small sum of about £30 million, absolute priority was given to programmes for two secondary schools that happened to be in the maintained sector, which had to go ahead because they had concrete cancer—lumps were falling off and endangering children. We are talking about going ahead with programmes for two schools that will cost about £20 million out of a package of £30 million—those programmes had to go ahead.<br><br>
We considered that package together with the Chancellor's package and ensured that balance was achieved, which enabled us to go ahead with the Regent House and Enniskillen programmes. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we look for balance in the school capital programme, but we must go by need. Would the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
Gentleman rather that the building programme was £80 million or £26 million for the year? I look forward to hearing his commendation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, my remarks have got through to the Minister, and he is aware of the sensitivity on which the announcements touched as they were released. My colleagues and I certainly welcome the additional moneys that have been released for new capital starts throughout the Province. Being aware of the difficulties that ministers face in choosing the number one priority for expenditure, I was conveying to the Minister and his officials the fact that announcements are closely scrutinised.<br><br>
The Minister must admit that I made no personal representation to him or his Department on the allocation of funding or the new starts, despite my having received many representations, because I was aware of the difficulties. It might have been helpful if some reason had been given, such as the one that the Minister has mentioned—who could dispute the need to replace schools that have concrete cancer? I have an example here of a school in which buildings cannot be used for the next two years—the school has been waiting for improvements for 12 years. I think that the Minister and his officials are now aware that when announcements are made, they might be more sensitively delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to achieve balance on every capital programme announcement, especially when dealing with secondary schools. When there is huge expenditure on a secondary school of the order of £10 million to £11 million within a small package, it is impossible to achieve balance. However, I give the assurance that we are always conscious of those issues and I will certainly send the hon. Gentleman the statistics to prove just how balanced we are in our allocation of resources.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast South, referred to employers using the system on the new deal, for example. We are conscious of that and we do not want the new deal to be undermined by the system being abused. We are closely monitoring the situation but, if the hon. Gentleman can cite any examples of the system being abused in that way, we will intervene. The responses to the new deal by the private sector in Northern Ireland have been well above those in Great Britain. The number of firms that have signed up to it has been exemplary. For example, yesterday, people from Northern Ireland Electricity wen to its training centre at Nutts corner and met some young people who were recruited to the new deal to undertake electrical work, including the linesman's work at height, which I attempted somewhat miserably. Such firms, which are becoming involved in the new deal, are worthy of praise.<br><br>
I cannot remember the exact spark that set off another of the comments by the hon. Member for Belfast, South but he sounded as though he wanted us to turn in and not look out. He spoke about spending British money on people from the European Union. Let us not go down that road; we must look outwards. During the past week, I have been involved in the Premier programme, which is sponsored by the Training and Employment Agency, and the Explorers programme under which Northern Ireland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0645">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
graduates travel all over the world and are taken on as members of staff in export firms. They gain immense credit for those firms as well as for Northern Ireland. Such programmes are carried out extremely well. The economic and social benefits of welcoming people in and sending people out are enormous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister supports my points that we must go abroad. However, I said that we are not giving our younger folk the opportunity to go to Scotland to be educated and to receive the proper rate. I was arguing that they were being penalised at the European Union level. Can the Minister assure us that young people going to Scotland to be educated will receive the full rate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the past, there has been parity in the relationship between Northern Ireland and England and that has been maintained. It is open to the hon. Gentleman to say what this party will do this time next year on such matters. Will it change the budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall monitor with great interest that commitment by the Ulster Unionist party on next year's expenditure.<br><br>
I shall write in detail to the hon. Member for West Tyrone about the financial matters that he raised, but the simple answer to all his questions is that he was not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
comparing like with like. He was not including some of the extra items that have been put into the budget. We both welcome the resumption of beef exports, and I am sure that he will have commended my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who was in Luxembourg last week, for giving a boost to the sale of beef. We have put about £2 million into the programme to help the market.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked when the date-based export scheme will be agreed. We are maintaining pressure on the Commission to make progress with the scheme and hope that an interim decision will be made to the Standing Veterinary Committee this month, which is the next stage in the process.<br><br>
I believe that I have covered most of the matters raised. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked several questions, some of which I can answer now. The Bleach Green upgrade will go ahead this year and is certainly in the programme. I shall write to him on the dualling for Larne and the interconnector bid. He also asked about tourism and I have already responded to that.<br><br>
We have had an interesting debate this morning and if I have failed to respond to any matters in detail, I shall put that right in correspondence. I thank hon. Members for their contributions.</span></p>
