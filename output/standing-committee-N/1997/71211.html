	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. This debate goes on until 1 o'clock. There will be a half-hour Adjournment debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of Public Expenditure in Northern Ireland in 1998–99.</p></q>
A copy of my speech and details of the relevant allocations have been placed in the Library. I take heed of your admonition about time, Mr. Atkinson; I shall be as brief as possible. The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Reverend Martin Smyth) will miss part of his lunch break as a consequence of the 1 o'clock Adjournment debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant, interesting and almost historic that this is the first meeting of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee at which public expenditure allocations will be announced. I look forward to listening to what my hon. Friends and Opposition Members consider to be right for Northern Ireland spending plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no public expenditure survey this year. In its place, the Government have initiated a comprehensive spending review. The review is examining each spending programme and considering whether it contributes to the Government's objectives, whether it is the most effective way of achieving those objectives and whether there is scope for improving efficiency and effectiveness. That will ensure that future spending plans fully reflect the Government's priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spending review will be completed next year, and the allocations to Departments for 1999–2000 and subsequent years will be determined in light of the outcome of the review. This is the first time since direct rule that a Government has launched such an extensive consultation exercise on spending priorities. It has been done on an unprecedented scale and has involved
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
all the political parties in Northern Ireland, local authorities, businesses, trade unions and the voluntary sector. It has been helpful to me to read and to hear a wide range of views on public spending and priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are sticking to the totals that were set in the inherited spending plans for this year and for next, subject to the changes announced in the July Budget, and particularly the deployment of the proceeds from the windfall levy. The plans that I shall announce this morning for 1998–99 are consistent with that commitment; they represent reallocations within a Northern Ireland public expenditure total of £8·4 billion, excluding cyclical social security benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plans must, of course, be seen against the background of developments in the Northern Ireland economy, which has been performing well. A record number of people are in jobs and unemployment is continuing its downward trend. The current level is similar to that of 1981, and manufacturing output continues to outperform the rest of the United Kingdom. Like all members of the Committee, I want those trends to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comprehensive review is extremely welcome. Will my hon. Friend confirm that there will be a Northern Ireland version of the social exclusion unit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We are liasing on the matter with the relevant Whitehall Departments. I shall write to my hon. Friend later about the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the July Budget the Government provided substantial extra resources for Northern Ireland, for welfare to work, the health service, education and housing. Those Budget allocations have been well received in the Province and amount in total to £9 million in 1997–98 and £117 million in the coming financial year. In addition, the Government announced a further £5 million for health this year to deal with winter pressures. Of course, Northern Ireland will also benefit from measures announced in the Chancellor's pre-Budget statement, with additional resources for child care and assistance of up to £50 per household to pensioners during the winter months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment is a huge waste of our economic potential and a major cause of poverty. A priority of the Government is to tackle the root causes of unemployment and provide new opportunities for work. Our welfare-to-work initiative will help us to do this. The new deal for the unemployed is aimed at getting the young and long-term unemployed into jobs and to help them to stay in employment. It aims to increase the long-term employability of the unemployed by improving their self respect, their skills, their experience and their motivation. In 1998–99, some £36 million of the £140 million allocated to Northern Ireland over the life of this Parliament will be spent on assisting the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next year we shall provide £1.8 million to introduce a new programme of assistance for lone parents, which will offer help and advice on jobs, training and child care to lone parents who wish to find work. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
addition, some £32 million currently allocated to the Training and Employment Agency's temporary employment and training programmes will continue to offer opportunities for the long-term unemployed. The activities of action for community employment, community work programme and Enterprise Ulster will be aligned with the new deal. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will set out the plans in greater detail in a separate announcement very shortly. Overall, in 1998–99, we will provide about 16,000 places for the young and long-term unemployed, compared with 7,400 in 1997–98.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Targeting social need continues to be an important underlying theme relevant to many public expenditure allocations and we shall try to ensure that programme spending is targeted on those areas and on people in greatest social need. The allocations for welfare to work will make a significant contribution to the objectives of targeting social need. The Government are also considering their response to the comments on targeting social need raised earlier by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now refer in more detail to the allocations to particular programmes, beginning with education. In the July Budget Northern Ireland received £27.6 million for schools next year. As well as ensuring that schools have the resources that they need to cover teachers' pay and other costs, the allocations will be used to enhance pre-school provision, to reduce class sizes in primary one, and on action to raise school standards. Thus we are making a start on our manifesto commitments to increase education spending as we cut the costs of social and economic failure over the five years of this Parliament; to extend nursery education; and to reduce class sizes in the early years of primary education. In addition, the new deal for schools announced in the Budget will provide £8 million next year and in each of the following three years for improvement of schools' infrastructure—the need for which has been the subject of comment by many Northern Ireland Members while I have been in this job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From 1 April 1998, the Northern Ireland further education colleges will become incorporated bodies. On a like for like basis, further education will have a real-term increase in funding of 1.65 per cent., to ensure that the colleges have the best possible start in their new status, and hence make a strong contribution to achieving educational standards. I can also confirm that Northern Ireland universities will benefit from the changes in student support expenditure that were announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We cannot discuss more general aspects, including preparatory schools, but my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will respond in the winding-up speech to some points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's first acts was to increase the inherited expenditure plans for education in 1997–98. I am pleased to announce today that we shall increase the planned expenditure that we inherited for 1998–99 by £38 million. That is clear evidence of the Government's strong commitment to education. I am sure that the increased allocations will be widely welcomed by parents, pupils and teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister giving way because I know that he wants to move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister dealt with running costs in his comments on allocation of the education budget. Will the capital expenditure that has been set aside be reserved for schools that do not manage to obtain private finance initiative funding, or will we rely on the PFI to provide a large amount of capital funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to that later. We cannot rely on private finance to tackle the serious problem of funding for schools in Northern Ireland. There is nothing wrong with obtaining funding from the private sector that will enhance and complement the funding that I announced. However, it must not replace state funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of PFI, the problem for education is that the PFI providers will not consider schemes that cost less than £5 million unless they are part of a package. Therefore, it will remain difficult for Northern Ireland schools that may have specific plans for schemes that cost

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
£1 million or £1.5 million to obtain support from the PFI unless a change occurs in its attendant bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point about the difficulties that we encounter when we consider the juxtaposition of PFI with the ordinary way in which we spend money in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland has an integrated health and personal social services programme, which, I am happy to announce, will benefit from a substantial real terms increase next year. Again, I am sure that that will be widely welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £31 million for health and personal social services, announced in the Budget, will be used primarily to develop front line services; in particular, to address waiting lists, for community care, for additional investment in cancer services and for implementing the Children Order in Northern Ireland. In addition, I am announcing a further £2 million for health and safety work in the health sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allocations will ensure that the health and personal social services budget will increase in real terms, in line with our manifesto commitment, by 1.9 per cent. over the 1997–98 plans. Some £3·1 billion, or 56 per cent., of the Northern Ireland public expenditure block, excluding social security benefits, will be spent on health and education. That is a significant investment in those key services. It reflects the priorities of the Government. We were elected, among other reasons, because of our commitment to improve our health and education services. Those services are priorities in Northern Ireland as well as in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Law and order has been a substantial programme for many years, for obvious reasons. It is right that we should keep under constant review the resources that are required to deal effectively with terrorism and civil disorder. Despite the ceasefires, it is still too early to assess any potential future peace dividend from the law and order programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will examine the appropriate level of resources for future years as part of the spending review. However, the civil disorder and criminal damage caused earlier this year have placed a regrettable claim on resources that could and should have been spent on other programmes in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In total, an additional £14·5 million has had to be allocated to the law and order programme. We are faced with a bill of £6 million next year for criminal damage from civil disorder and from the bomb at Markethill on 16 September. The block will also have to provide £5 million to meet an increase in criminal injury claims. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that that money would be better spent on improving our schools and hospitals and the employment prospects of people in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other additions to the law and order programme are £1·5 million to meet the costs of the Parades Commission, established in March 1997. We are also
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
providing £2 million to the Prison Service to meet contractual commitments on a new building programme at Her Majesty's prison at Maghaberry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spending on the Police Authority grant will be contained within the baseline of £658 million already established for 1998–99. A pressure of £7 million to fund the RUC overtime at 8,500 average daily hours will be met from the introduction of efficiency targets that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set for the Police Authority for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of law and order expenditure will be crucial in determining the budgets for health, education, roads, industrial development and other services in the years beyond 1998–99. That adds even greater urgency to the search for political agreement and lasting peace. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and I will make every effort to pursue those objectives, which are so vital to every man, woman and child living in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am greatly encouraged by the continuing interest of businesses in investing in Northern Ireland. We need more good quality projects to create lasting jobs in Northern Ireland to help sustain improvements in the economy. I am announcing a further £10 million for industrial development next year, mainly to meet pressures for new investment. The additional resources, which will bring the total for industrial development next year, to £115 million, will allow the Industrial Development Board to build on its successes and to continue to provide effective support towards developing the local economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had to find reductions in other programmes to meet the pressures in health, education, and law and order. The housing programme will need to bear some £17 million of those reductions; that is necessary to balance the books, although the amount of public support available next year will still be about £230 million. That includes the £13 million allocation to Northern Ireland from the capital receipts initiative, which will help to sustain the social housing programme. The transfer to housing associations of the function of building new social housing will help to mitigate the effects of the reductions, and when the Northern Ireland Housing Executive's own resources are taken into account, the total expenditure on housing will be just over £600 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In determining the allocation of resources to the Housing Executive, rental income is always taken into account. Rents will increase from the beginning of April 1998 by an average of about £1.60 a week. We have also had to make adjustments to the roads maintenance programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a rough percentage, what does the £1.60 a week, to which the Minister referred, equate to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
We have also had to make adjustments to the roads maintenance programme, although some £62 million will still be available next year. That will mean some delays in the start of a number of schemes, rather than their abandonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who represent rural constituencies will be interested to know that the rural development programme aims to stimulate the economic and social revitalisation of the most disadvantaged rural areas in Northern Ireland. An additional £2 million will be made available next year to help to ensure that opportunities for community activities are fully developed and that new partnerships involving local people continue in disadvantaged rural areas. I do not have a calculator with me, but I can now answer the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik). The rent increase is 4·8 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall civil service running costs have been broadly flat in cash terms in recent years. We will continue to keep control of running costs and improve civil service efficiency. We are making some reallocations within the block total to address the most pressing demands on Departments, and additional running costs will be allocated to Northern Ireland in support of the welfare-to-work initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) has already mentioned, Northern Ireland Departments are also exploring all opportunities for improving value for money in partnership with the private sector. Several small PFI projects have been completed and a number of other, larger projects are at various stages of the procurement process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plans that we have inherited are tight but the situation has been greatly eased by the allocations that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his July Budget. The plans affected the whole of the United Kingdom but within Northern Ireland they amount to almost £67 million, which was not available before for education and health, and £36 million for welfare to work for the unemployed next year. It is important to understand that that is over and above the amount allocated to Northern Ireland in the Government's public expenditure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have provided more for key programmes for education and health. More has also been provided for the industrial development programme. We have had to provide additional amounts for law and order. Work on the spending review will continue and that will, of course, tackle the issue of priorities and reallocations in the longer term which must be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures that I have announced this morning and the policies that they represent will affect schools, hospitals, unemployment schemes and inward industrial development from abroad. All those matters affect the quality of life of ordinary women, men and children in Northern Ireland, whom hon. Members on the Committee have been elected to represent. The Government have gone a long way to ensure that people concentrate their minds on the priorities of reducing hospital waiting lists and class sizes. I hope and pray that the day will come—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous Government published public expenditure plans. A very fruitful table-12.8 in the document—giving 1995–96 prices shows the comparative expenditure for different Departments going back to 1991–92. Would it be possible to have those adjusted so that the new expenditure amounts that the Minister is spelling out could be added to? That table also contains the figures for 1999–2000, but presumably those have gone now and no alternative figures could be produced for that period to complete the table. Presumably it could be completed up to the coming year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we will be able to supply my hon. Friend with the necessary comparisons and figures as quickly as possible. When members of the Committee read those figures and see the changes they will realise, as I said earlier, that the figures represent what we might call the real Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland where people have to live and work as they do in the rest of this country. I hope that peace will arrive and that the talks process will continue successfully. I know that hon. Members are anxious to be able to speak about all these matters or public expenditure, especially in health and education which are so important to their constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.56 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Government on the consultation opportunities that have been provided for participation in the comprehensive national spending review. I am confident, as are my colleagues, that the two top priorities in Northern Ireland will echo the Prime Minister's commitment to education, education and education, followed by health, health and health, provided that there is adequate funding for care in the community that will immediately lead to a reduction in bed blocking. Bed blocking is an expensive problem in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland has the largest average household size, but the lowest weekly gross income of the UK regions. In Northern Ireland the average weekly income is only £323 compared with that in the highest region, the south-east of England, where the figure is £440 per week—in other words 25 per cent. higher. We welcome the recognition in the planned expenditure proposals that, overall, Northern Ireland experiences the highest level of deprivation of any region of the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the higher level of public expenditure is justified under the Barnett formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law and order protective miscellaneous services budget at over £900 million reflects the cost of terrorism. If savings arise in this budget—that is, if there is to be a peace dividend—we should like to see the money saved reapplied within Northern Ireland to reduce the massive backlog of maintenance and new build required in both education and health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also feel that resources in addition to the £1·3 million already allocated to the chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland should be applied to assist him to defeat those who set out to perpetuate electoral fraud.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
Expenditure on the Northern Ireland Prison Service is nearly £150 million, which is a huge drain on resources. We would welcome savings and a reduction in the cost per prisoner to below the target figure, but at £71, 762 it is still too high and we would support initiatives to further reduce unit costs per prisoner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Letting them out perhaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be one way to ensure that massive funding would be needed to repair bomb-damaged properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 6 in the document deals with the economic development budget. Will the Minister explain the increased cost—it rose to £9,301 per job—of the new jobs that were created in 1996, set out in table 6.8? I nevertheless congratulate the Industrial Development Board and the Local Enterprise Development Board on their job creation initiatives; and note the success of Northern Ireland companines in creating additional jobs as a result of export success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the crisis in our beef, sheep and pig sectors, could consideration be given to transferring some selective financial assistance to help them? I appeal on behalf of the farming community in Northern Ireland for fair play within the European Union. Scientific advisers to the previous Government and some compound feed millers contributed to the agricultural crisis. Even if the last case of BSE is cleared tomorrow, it will be years before confidence is restored in our reputation for quality beef and other products. Prices at meat plants and markets should be higher, reflecting the cost of production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We urge the Minister to press upon the Government the need to obtain additional funding from the European Union for the storage of beef in Northern Ireland. There should be clearance of our agricultural products for world-wide export. Other regions of the United Kingdom should show that they are BSE free. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should also consider yielding some of the present budget to create fair trading for our farmers within the European Union—through the various compensatory measures presently available—to counter the damage caused to our agriculture by the strength of sterling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Northern Ireland is perfectly placed—especially in view of the meticulous tracking processes already in place—to provide the precedent of a phased lifting of the beef ban for the rest of the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Conscious as we are about flags in Northern Ireland, we could indeed—if we were given the opportunity—be the flagbearer for British beef internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Table 6.157 deals with the commuity work programme. The scheme is much appreciated and valued by the longp-term unemployed and by the communities involved in it. Will the Minister comment on the evaluation of the pilot project, completed earlier this year, and future plans for the scheme? I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
emphasise how much we welcome the new deal for the young unemployed in Northern Ireland and the opportunity that young people will have to gain real jobs. About 16,500 jobs will eventually be created, and that will have a huge impact on the hopes and aspirations of people who have been caught in the poverty trap for so long. I thank the Minister for the detailed brief which he supplied on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 7 deals with expenditure in Northern Ireland by the Department of the Environment. We want to see more evidence of protecting the environment and wildlife and of better management of natural resources and waste in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister seriously consider appointing an environment commissioner in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disappointing to note that table 7.2 reduces planned expenditure for the Roads Service by nearly £18 million—from £152 million in 1994–95 to £134 million in 1999–2000. Our economic growth and development very much depend on a good roads infrastructure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that it is a good idea for people, when they telephone a Government Department, to have a human being to speak to rather than an answering machine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the experience of hon. Members in Great Britain, but one is lucky to be able to leave a message on the answering machine of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. There is little chance of speaking to the person one wishes to contact, and one is lucky to get on the tape because there are so many messages already on it. In fairness to the Department's officers, if a message is left for them, they return the call. None the less, I agree with my hon. Friend and accept his point entirely. It is most unsatisfactory if one cannot communicate person to person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial investment is needed in roads to achieve economic growth and development. I never miss an opportunity to refer to the need to upgrade the A8 in my constituency and the A2. I am aware of projects such as the Toomebridge bypass, but we need better road links to our ports and airports and to the northwest of the Province. Improvement in roads to Fermanagh and the west is vital to enable those areas of Northern Ireland to share in economic development and prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, the Minister will help to remove the sense of isolation felt in every rural community throughout Northern Ireland. That feeling is a consequence of the stringent conditions that his Department has imposed on the road gritting programme. I will be delighted to hear of any successes to date with private finance initiatives for new roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urban regeneration expenditure is still under the DOE budget. It is obvious that a disproportionate amount of that expenditure is spent in Belfast and Londonderry and not in the rest of Northern Ireland. Like my colleagues, I welcome the success of that expenditure in Belfast and Londonderry; it has attracted significant private sector investment.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
However, the time has come for the DOE to look beyond Londonderry and Belfast. It should assist the regeneration of other provincial towns in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On table 8, I accept the point that funding preparatory schools is a matter for another day. However, as a marker, I point out that the proposed reduction in funding for preparatory schools cannot be justified. The proposal is a sign of class prejudice and envy. Parents often make great sacrifices to place their children in preparatory schools, but I have said enough about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Minister's success in achieving additional expenditure to what was already planned for Northern Ireland. We recognise that that has made a valuable contribution in stabilising pupil-teacher ratios and securing classroom jobs. We look forward to further benefit in that sphere. However, significant investment is needed in many aspects of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend confirm information that I have received that if all preparatory schools' pupils were transferred, the Department would save £1·5 million, but that their transfer into the primary school sector would cost £5 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow that up, as I am conscious that Mr. Atkinson might remind me that it is a matter for another day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I think that it was made clear that we could discuss the issue. In fact, the Minister said that his hon. Friend would be making notes and replying to us. I should have thought that it would be in order: the matter concerns education expenditure. There are always ways and means in Parliament to get in one's stroke, and I hope that the anxiety of the hon. Member for East Antrim is not a real one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I make it clear that the scope of the debate is shaped by the Minister's statement. There is nothing to stop hon. Members questioning the Minister on any subject that is relevant to the subject of that statement, but I have no power to make the Minister answer them. It is up to him whether he does or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Atkinson. I readily accept the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim, Mr. Forsythe who, like me, has probably been able to make a calculation to show the nonsensical nature of the proposal about preparatory schools, and the added cost that it would incur to the public purse, if the Minister should be foolish enough to accept such a recommendation. It should be emphasised that there is no subsidy from the public purse for preparatory school pupils. The reverse is true and there should be no further cut in the funding to those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extensive aspects of education infrastructure need additional resources, and none more than the youth service. The service has held together the fabric of our society with respect to the young, and has been decimated in recent years as boards have tried to make money available for classrooms. Much good work is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
being done and in the planned expenditure it is essential to take due account of the importance of adequate funding for the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our library service has also suffered. For example, the Northern Ireland average per capita expenditure on libraries is about £9·50, whereas in the rest of the United Kingdom it is £13·50. The chief librarian of the board in my constituency has suggested that to reach the average Northern Ireland standard, never mind the average United Kingdom standard, an investment of an additional £906,000 would be needed. The new Government have placed great emphasis on high literacy standards for all. The operation of an effective library service within the education system would do much to make that a reality. I hope that we shall see significant additional investment or funding to make further investment in youth and library services possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that there are indications that there will be substantial future capital funding for schools and colleges but it should be remembered that if it comes through PFI it is rather like mortgaging the family silver. It is not really a substitute for proper public financing of capital projects. There is a real need in the further and higher education sectors to take account of student numbers in Northern Ireland and the impact which the cap has had on our colleges and universities. The Government must remedy that problem and remove the cap immediately, as recommended in the Dearing report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Targeting social need is a problem and until that approach is replaced all pupils, in whichever schools they attend, should attract equal funding under targeting for social need. I welcome the Government's commitment to early-years education and to the prospect of additional nursery schools. I request that closer attention is given to needs in special education. I continue to receive complaints, as do my colleagues, about current procedures for statementing. The time has come to review that area of education and rebuild with the much simpler concept of meeting children's needs with appropriate schools through quality provision. Statementing takes too long and is less than satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of those things, regrettably, cost money. It is difficult to see where savings could be obtained. But perhaps much more can be achieved for pupils and young people through closer intergovernment collaboration within Departments, the collaboration to which the Government are committed. Failure to do that will result in dissipated effort and resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education and library boards in Northern Ireland have been attempting to achieve savings in transport by standardising holiday arrangements throughout Northern Ireland. That has not been an easy task. There has been much public debate over the issue. Having achieved agreement, however, boards find that Translink, the main transport operator in this area, cannot pass on savings because the Department of the Environment has reduced its fuel duty rebate. Instead of savings, the boards are now faced with an additional bill of £1·2 million.

That is ludicrous. It highlights the necessity for all Government Departments to collaborate to achieve their objectives. For too long the mandarins in Stormont have pursued personal agendas without any real co-ordination. That is the real task of the new Government, and it is an important role for this Committee to co-ordinate policy for the benefit of people, especially young people, in the Province.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eddie McGrady 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate, which those of us from Northern Ireland particularly welcome. The Minister said that two factors—objectivity and effectiveness—were important in his review and in the Government review of public expenditure. I want to add two further dimensions: equity and its application and the restoration of balance where there was inequity. Those are not symbolic matters or idle comments; for decades some areas and communities in Northern Ireland did not benefit from the years of plenty. Indeed, they suffered then, and they still suffer in the years of scarcity. The pale is an old term which was used to describe the Danish settlement around Dublin, and I describe the settlement around Belfast on the shores of Strangford lough as the new pale. Beyond that pale, Government eyes and Government money do not seem to follow. I ask the Minister to take on board the two additional concepts of equity and the restoration of balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister paid little attention to the enormous problems in agriculture in Northern Ireland, although in one sense I can understand why. I appreciate that the problem is circumscribed by events in Brussels, but agriculture is Northern Ireland's base industry. It is the principal provider of employment and therefore affects families' standard of living. It is Northern Ireland's biggest industry but at the moment it is being crucified on every side. There was the BSE debacle of March 1996, the withdrawal of interventions and the difficulty of exporting even to the so-called friendly parts of the United Kingdom, the complete depletion of the pig market, the difficulties in the potato market and the new scares this morning about lamb. I have said it before and I will say it again: rural Ireland is facing its greatest problems since the famine and they must be addressed in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

None the less, we should cast our minds back several months and remember that, in spite of traceability, farmers in Northern Ireland were prevented from exporting their cattle to the European Union, largely because of the attitude of farmers in other parts of the United Kingdom. That has been factually recorded.

As to the broad thrust of the Minister's presentation, I welcome the additional expenditure on health and education. I sincerely hope that the bulk of that money, if not all of it, goes to the coalface of delivery of services to patients and students. It should not be wafted off to different areas, as so often happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned extended waiting lists. In some parts of my constituency, waiting lists have increased as much as four or fivefold, and it is the same throughout Northern Ireland. That must be tackled as a matter of urgency. Equally important is the unacceptable rundown of basic, community-care provisions, which hon. Members come across on a day-to-day basis when we speak to our constituents. The Minister must accept that we cannot wait until 1998–99 and beyond to address the problems that it creates. The matter must be tackled now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply concerned that the responsibility for building new schools and hospitals will be shunted into the cul-de-sac of PFI. I have some local experience of PFI, which in many cases is absolute nonsense, especially in the context of small units. It is a time-consuming and expensive exercise for the Department and for the agency involved and a bonanza for the consultants who are employed. At the end of day, we may as well just pay for everything rather than involve the PFI. For example, the public have already spent £8 million on water privatisation and there is another £12 million in the pipeline to prepare for something which every elected Member of Parliament and local councillor in Northern Ireland absolutely rejects, 100 per cent. That money could have built the hospital that Downpatrick has wanted for 30 years, with some to spare. But that is another story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a strong suspicion in Northern Ireland that the PFI is an effective way of deferring spending? There was an earlier reference to £5 million projects. I understand that in schools and colleges alone there is about £250 million for 100 different projects which could go to the PFI.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his confirmation of my attitude to PFI and I hope that we will be able to expose the waste of money involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go quickly through the other areas of expenditure in deference to hon. Members who may wish to speak. I want to correct a small slip that the Minister made this morning when he was talking about unemployment and job provision. According to statistics, in October, unemployment in Northern Ireland increased for the first time in 18 months. I am sure that I share with the Minister the hope that that is a temporary blip in an otherwise downward trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equality of opportunity to create employment is important. I refer again to the fact that inward investment is not justly distributed geographically in Northern Ireland. I have heard many excuses for that inequality from the Department and from the Industrial Development Board, none of which has been sustained in the light of the subsequent location
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
of inward investment. The loading of grant aid or assistance should direct inward investors to areas where high unemployment is sustained and endemic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an element in the budget for action for community employment, the ACE programme. Northern Ireland has a very good ACE programme which has made a considerable contribution to helping the long-term unemployed to return to the workplace. The programme is in jeopardy, as it was under the previous Administration; its funding has been cut tremendously. I ask the Minister to look carefully at what is happening. The ACE programme is a proven method of getting long-term unemployed people back to work. To substitute an untried and as yet unknown concept would require a great act of faith that it will be better than the present programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the involvement of PFI in roads and transport projects—the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) mentioned PFI involvement in the Toome bypass. What is happening in my constituency is symptomatic of the problem. For example, the road ferry service on the Ards peninsula in County Down is the only one in Northern Ireland. It is important to the people whom I represent. The route should not be sliced up and its pieces given to a profit-making company to provide its shareholders with dividends. The Ards community and the economic well-being of the area requires the Government to keep the ferry public despite charges, and to maintain some control over it. I hope that the Minister will examine the matter carefully. I appreciate that ship replacement is required, and that no such replacement has occurred since the ferry was opened many years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed in the substantial diminution of resources to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is one of Northern Ireland's success stories, and the transfer of its new-build function to housing associations. That is not cost effective. The Minister claimed in his opening remarks that effectiveness was necessary, but he is being ineffective on that matter. Statistics clearly show that providing social housing through housing associations is more expensive than proceeding through the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A social aspect should also be considered, which is that social housing is for those in the greatest need. People who cannot provide for themselves should be housed on the basis of the greatest need, and housing associations have a history of not housing those in the greatest need. They have failed to do that since their inception. They pay lip service to the concept of taking names from a central housing register, but we know that that does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that above-inflation increases in average rents, together with cuts in lone-parent benefit, which were passed on Report last night, will further disadvantage those in greatest need in Northern Ireland as well as in other parts of the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The welfare of householders and those who seek homes depends on a range of benefits. For many reasons, Northern Ireland has the highest
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
uptake of social benefits in the United Kingdom. If we remove the new-build function from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, people in greatest need will not be housed. That is a fact, and one the Minister should consider carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to comment on rural development and the extra £2 million that the Minister announced. Research should be conducted into the best methods of tackling rural development, which has been somewhat spasmodic and adrift. I appreciate the £2 million, but, in the context of the whole of Northern Ireland, it is not a vast sum with which to attack the problems that beset a rural community, such as sustaining the community viability and the creation of appropriate local industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems with new-build and old houses. We are not allowed to carry out planning in sensitive areas. Indeed, there is a plethora of problems. While £2 million might not be enough to tackle them, it is a good start. It is important to consider the way in which it will be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general problem with the way in which money is spent in Northern Ireland involves the proliferation of agencies. The in-word was agentisation, but it is now externalisation, which may lead to extermination! It is a great tragedy that under the guise of cost-effectiveness and delivery-effectiveness, agentisation is seen to be a panacea. In reality, it has proved to be the opposite. Furthermore, it is unaccountable, as hon. Members are aware. When we ask the Minister a question on any of the agency's operational matters, it is referred to the chairman of the agency. That is not parliamentary accountability. Agentisation is not cost effective in financial terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I believe that in general, Government expenditure should be at least partly targeted at appropriate areas, or to those such as social need, according to the policy appraisal and fair treatment concept. Those are especially important issues in Northern Ireland because of the way in which money was allocated to substructures and the infrastructure in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must examine equity in provision and redress imbalance. In my constituency, during the past 15 years, there has not been £1 of major capital expenditure on roads: not £1. There has been no spending on new building in the health sector. I could tell the same story for many other sectors. We have not had one inward investor in the constituency during my time there. These examples show the multiple facets of deprivation, and any new review must address them. It must be a real review, not merely the movement of money from one book to another, but one that affects people in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he has heard the opinions of the Committee and those from other places, the Minister might consider that the establishment of a properly balanced and able—I shall now be accused of wanting another quango—advisory Committee would be the best way to address the problems of deprivation. Perhaps such a Committee already exists, hidden in the depths of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Stormont building. Such opinions would give us an overall view of where the changes could be made and what their effects might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to consider public expenditure in the Province. It is often overlooked by the media in their constant focus on the constitutional issues that have caused such deep division. Daily life has to go on, however. The people of Northern Ireland have to live; children have to be educated; people have to be housed and they have to be taken care of when they are ill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to the media ignoring public expenditure in Northern Ireland, does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do. The newspapers ignore how much money is being spent on the security of people whose antecedent would have been to blow up Downing Street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Daily life in our Province has to continue. The people of Northern Ireland have kept the Province going, under tremendous pressure, and they are to be congratulated on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plight of agriculture has already been emphasised by my colleagues, and I support what they have said. Some of us met the Prime Minister yesterday to discuss agriculture. The right hon. Gentleman promised me last night that he will respond to the discussion as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) has said, agriculture is not under pressure only in the beef industry. With bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the whole industry is in a very bad state. The situation is the worst that it has been since I took any interest in such matters. There has been a reduction of 37 per cent. in farm incomes. A similar reduction in the next year will bankrupt the whole farming community. There is a serious crisis in the pig and lamb industries. A farmer told me that a few months ago lambs sold for £50, but now farmers are lucky if they can get half that amount. There is a crisis in the potato industry too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over and above all those particular problems is the general crisis in agriculture. For example, about 1,000 cattle a week are piling up on our farms-2,000 a fortnight, 3,000 in three weeks and so on. Those cattle will be overweight and over-aged even if intervention takes place. What will happen to them? The Northern Ireland Office and the Government more widely should be applying themselves to planning a rescue operation. That is exactly what is needed for our agriculture, which is the most basic industry in Northern Ireland. If agriculture goes down, every facet of our problems will be effected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
We must concentrate on agriculture. We must have instant money to keep our agriculture going. The turn of the year will be a serious one without a rescue package. I trust that Ministers hearing these words will press as hard as they can to achieve one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the publication of the Green Paper on health, which may help us to see into the Minister's mind to ascertain how it is working. I hope that hon. Members' comments today will prevent Ministers going down the wrong road. Politicians do sometimes make U-turns. Last night, for example, some Labour Members showed that they can make U-turns, but I do not want to get into a family dispute within the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the centralisation of maternity services at the Royal Victoria hospital away from the Jubilee hospital. Why was the Mater hospital not brought into an overall review of maternity services? I was leader of the Opposition at Stormont when friends of the hon. Member for South Down left. The Mater hospital case came up then, the Government having been chary of doing anything for it. My colleagues and myself, however, pressed for the Mater hospital to be included in and to receive money from the health service, provided that Protestant patients would not be subject to the medical strictures of Catholicism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is tragic that the Mater hospital has been left out for purely sectarian reasons. Dealing with the provision of services at the hospital has been avoided but I hope that the Minister will come to grips with the problem in the Green Paper. A case can be made for maintaining the Jubilee maternity unit and closing the Mater maternity unit, and the Minister must face that. Heretofore the Government have not even considered the issue, at least not in any papers that I have seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be aware that the Royal Victoria site has been a safe haven for terrorists. One of my colleagues was visiting his little boy there last year when an attempt was made to kill him. The bullet went through one of the incubators in the children's ward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My ministerial duties took me at times to the Royal Victoria hospital, but I have had to stop going there. I visited my church secretary who was in the hospital after suffering a heart attack. After I left the ward, two IRA men came in and asked the secretary, "What bed was Paisley at?". Consequently, the man had another heart attack. I ceased to visit the Royal Victoria hospital after those events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in Northern Ireland think that putting money into the Royal Victoria site will not be a good idea until it is safe for people to go there. Many public representatives have to go to the hospital, and there is extra expenditure on their security to get them in and get them out. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the extent of that security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way of helping the poorest in our society is not only through the tax system, but through benefit reform and active labour-market policies. I worry about the restrictive practices that are encouraged by Fair Employment Commission legislation. Help is given to indigenous companies, but local investors,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
who have a stake in society, should receive greater assistance. It is important that we build up indigenous business in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On schools, I do not like eenie-meenie-minie-mo accountancy and the way in which the budget is balanced. When money is available, the Government balance the budget between a school that is maintained, another that is controlled and another that is integrated. That is not the way that our school system should operate. What is happening? The state sector now receives a raw deal, and everyone knows that. That problem must be rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state sector of education is not sectarian. It is open to everyone who wants to send their children to schools that are within it. All the Churches in Northern Ireland had schools, but the Stormont Government asked the Churches to hand over their schools to bring about a state system of education. The Roman Catholic Church was very wise and it did not hand over its schools, but the Protestant Churches did. A state system of education was, therefore, created, which welcomes everyone who wants to use it. I am sure that the Minister will agree that many state schools are partly integrated. The budget for education should be not piecemealed out to create a balance but should go to the areas where the need is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Homework clubs will be established in England and Wales to tackle the problem of social exclusion. A similar initiative is needed in Northern Ireland. I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion. I hope that, as part of the United Kingdom, we will be included in that scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Funding arrangements for voluntary prep-grammar schools is a major problem. I cannont understand the suggestion, even from a financial perspective—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that my constituency includes Harding memorial school and, a little bit further down the road, Downey house. Working-class people have paid to send their children there. If extra fees are demanded they will no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
longer be able to do so, yet those schools and others in the same area are already unable to cope with the children attending them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me on to travel costs for schools of one's choice. If children decide to attend state sector integrated schools, passing schools with empty desks, travel costs are payable. Yet in south Belfast, youngsters from working-class families attending secondary modern schools just inside the three-mile area have to pay, even though many of those families are unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman on that important matter. I hope that the Minister will take his point into account. My post bag has been bursting with letters from parents who are worried about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want elitist grammar and prep schools; I want all the people of Northern Ireland to benefit from them. Many families make sacrifices because a voluntary prep-grammar school may be in their area and, as the hon. Member for Belfast, East said it suits them to have their children attending such schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to read out part of a parent's letter that I received yesterday. Two of his children attend the preparatory department at Ballymena academy. He wrote that
	<br><q><p>"most of the parents currently make sacrifices to pay the existing fees so that they can have choice of schools in an area where primary schools are already over subscribed. This amounts to a double payment for their children's education since our high level of taxation already supports the education system."</p></q>
The headmaster of Ballymena academy has informed me that his school will lose £120,000 per annum—equivalenz`t to the payment of five or six members of staff. It is a serious matter and the Minister should take note of it. Would the Minister be prepared to receive a deputation of parents whose children attend these schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other important issues but I know that other hon. Members want to take part in the debate and I do not want to stand in their way. However, I want to stress that the Government should re-examine the benefits system in Northern Ireland. I am told that some people in part-time jobs demand to be paid in cash, thus avoiding any official reference being made to their earnings. I shall not go into detail but because a member of the Royal house was visiting, a security check was made on employees. It was found that all but two employees were being paid in cash because they were receiving state benefits. Those matters need to be carefully checked. It is unfair to others who are not getting those benefits to be done out of a job, even a part-time job, while those with that cosy arrangement with an employer get benefits that others could use more wisely and to which they are more entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Minister will speed up his Green Paper and, although the colour may not suit me politically, I will be glad to study it. The people of Northern Ireland have a long, hard score before them. I take a different view from the Government about the so-called peace that is so often discussed. Nevertheless, we have a responsibility as public representatives to do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

the best that we can for them and to give them the life to which they are entitled as they make a contribution to the peace and welfare of society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that in the last 90 minutes we have had four contributions and a number of hon. Members are trying to catch my eye to speak. It is probably desirable that we also give the Minister some time to answer the questions that have been put to him. Given that the debate will finish at one o'clock, I urge hon. Members to be as brief as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to your legitimate stricture, Mr. Atkinson, may I say that Scottish Members have the ill-deserved reputation of being even more longwinded than hon. Members from Northern Ireland, especially when debating relations between Northern Ireland and Scotland. I promise to be extremely brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few hon. Members have voiced their understandable concern about the plight of the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. May I make a plea for that other primary industry, the fishing industry? My ministerial colleagues are doing a good job, but it is essential that they, along with the Scottish Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ensure that our shared traditional fishing grounds are kept clean of pollution. While any engineering activities between Scotland and Northern Ireland may be essential, they should not disrupt or harm our fishermen as they go about their local activities in their traditional fishing grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comprehensive spending review is a brilliant stroke. It engages civil society in discussions about strategic, political decision-making. As Quintin Oliver, the director of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action said earlier this week in the 	<i>Irish News</i>:
	<br><q><p>"The Comprehensive Spending Review is a major, fresh and challenging opportunity for local people to get involved in influencing decisions about resources, which will affect their lives."</p></q>
As a good friend of Northern Ireland I have to say that that is entirely different from Tory grandees, who are a vanishing breed of course, going across over a period of 18 years and offering their Delphic decisions from behind high walls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government's priorities, against which spending plans may be judged, remain law and order, building the economy and targeting social need, as they were under the previous Government; or are they based upon fairness, justice and equality of opportunity, as outlined in the Secretary of State's remarkably fine speech at the British-Irish parliamentary body in London earlier this month? I was delighted that the Secretary of State said that the Government had
	<br><q><p>"launched an audit of Targeting Social Need in every Northern Ireland Department to measure their individual success".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
What criteria will be employed to assess Departments' success in targeting social need? I make a plea that the assessment results should be published in line with the openness with which Ministers are tackling problems in Northern Ireland. As I suggested earlier, I should like a Northern Ireland social exclusion unit to be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If current priorities are political, economic and social, the three pillars must be equal, so that the programme will be balanced. I hope that my hon. Friends the Ministers are confident that that will prove to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, like the hon. Member for South Down, welcome the opportunity presented by a Northern Ireland Grand Committee to air urgent matters concerning our constitutencies and Northern Ireland in general. I shall endeavour to be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two aspects of the educational set-up in Northern Ireland give cause for concern, particularly in rural areas. I make no apology for having broached the matter before—I assumed the licence to do so during a debate on the emergency provisions. In general, funding across the education sector is inadequate. In every stratum there is a deficit—I suppose there must always be one, but there is a serious deficit as to maintaining infrastructure in the primary school sector. With the aim of helping to overcome that problem, continuing pressure is exerted for the closure of smaller primary schools which we are told will provide better opportunity. As a child I attended a two-teacher primary school and as a schoolmaster I taught in a three-teacher primary school. Access to their own schools is a great advantage to small village communities. It sustains communities and more than that, it sustains integrated communities in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to discuss the matter in detail, but I hope that the Minister will examine the social advantages of maintaining the educational infrastructure at that level, in a way that will provide long-term benefit to a community in which two traditions must live and work together, taking into account their differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great need for capital investment at secondary level where what used to be called secondary intermediate schools are affected by inadequate provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one sector that has survived and done remarkably well has been that of the voluntary grammar school. That is because of support for those schools at all levels in our society. We all invest money in our grammar schools and their attached amenities, such as sporting facilities. It is disappointing that such success is under attack. We hoped that a re-examination of targeting social needs would lead to greater equity in the education system. However, the predominantly Protestant voluntary grammar schools are being cut out. The threshold set by targeting social need excludes them. That is not fair and it causes resentment within our tradition. Sometimes when I consider the Department of Education, I find it difficult to convince myself that no underlying

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
sectarian influences emerge to affect the issue that we are discussing and others, which I shall not mention. I hope that the Minister will accept my cautious words and ensure that such influences do not develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been cautious for too long. In the north-eastern education board area, which covers one of the largest Unionist areas in the Province, more than £3 million has been moved sideways because of the way in which TSN funding is applied. There is a serious imbalance in funding between the controlled and maintained sectors. Every youngster in the Province should be treated equally at every level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend says. I hope that the Minister will make an effort to examine that specific point. We do not want either tradition to be educationally disadvantaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the affirmation and support of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues, I want to ask him a direct question. Does he reject the principle that those who are socially deprived require more assistance than those who are not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman draws me down a path that I did not want to follow because of the pressure of time. I want to allude to decreasing unemployment, and to hint strongly at a black economy that exists in some parts of Northern Ireland and provides a distorted picture of social deprivation. It would take too much time to argue that case today. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that I and the members of my party oppose any educational inequity for either tradition. If he accepts that, he will appreciate my anxiety for voluntary grammar schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share entirely my hon. Friend's view that social deprivation, where it exists, should be tackled justly and fairly. The recent Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte report, which examined social deprivation and education, quantified the additional cost to schools of social deprivation at £58 per head. If the money allocated to that was evenly spread throughout Northern Ireland, it would be £275 per head, but it is not evenly spread; it is skewed badly because unfair and irrational criteria have been used.

The provision of third-level education is a matter that disturbs me deeply. When business investment takes place, it is, hopefully, intended to ensure a year-by-year return and an ability to manage cash-flow problems. In Northern Ireland we have a very good third-level education system, but it has traditionally been underfunded in such areas as money for research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have campuses at Queen's, Ulster university at Jordanstown and Coleraine, and Magee at the university of Londonderry. We also have two excellent teacher training colleges, St. Mary's and Stranmillis, which produced such people as my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim and me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that, because of a particular pressure, it is now proposed that, in a community of 1.6 million souls, we should have a campus at Springvale because it is a deprived area. I hope that the Minister will deal with this important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in the Ulster Unionist party would balk at the idea of investment in the Springvale area of west and north Belfast, if it would be productive. However, we do not want cash-flow problems, simply because there is a capital sum to be acquired and invested to provide a university in the area. We believe that it is wrong and unwise to spread the butter more thinly across that sector of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not, as there is not much time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister respond to that point? He felt unable to deal with the matter at our previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will sum up by saying that evidence has been presented—some, but not all of it, to the previous Government—that suggests that the Springvale concept, as currently being explored, is flawed and should not be proceeded with in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hospital sector in Northern Ireland is based on a philosophy that bears little relationship to the needs of society, and particularly rural areas where there is a need for easy access to hospital services. A broad-brush approach has been adopted that places a tremendous disadvantage—it has done for many years—on hospitals such as the two in my constituency. The Erne in Enniskillen and particularly the South Tyrone in Dungannon, which is right in the centre of Ulster, have become demoralised not by this Government, but by the previous one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government and the previous Opposition showed tremendous sympathy towards South Tyrone hospital, and no one showed more sympathy than the current Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In opposition, she agreed 100 per cent. with me and recognised that a hospital, which could raise almost £700,000 from local people to buy the most up-to-date imaging equipment, deserved constructive support. That support has not been forthcoming. However, I cannot go into the details on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Opposition spokesman, she attacked the previous Government's plans to cut ACE scheme jobs in Northern Ireland and the places provided by the job-skills programme? Now that she is in government, there are plans for at least £5 million cuts in the ACE scheme. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Secretary of State is going back on many of the things she said in opposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. The ACE programme provided useful opportunities for people when unemployment in Northern Ireland was as high as 16 per cent. or 17 per cent. Happily, unemployment has fallen to about 8 per cent. and—this relates to a point made by the hon. Member for South Down—Northern Ireland needs to clean up its act on the black economy. I put it no stronger than that. However, I do not want potential good high-tech jobs not being brought to the region that I represent because no one is interested in working. I am not against the ACE scheme, or against it being adapted to serve a purpose. However, it must encourage more people to get into work doing real jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider directing the next tranche of what is known as peace-and-reconciliation money specifically at the construction industry? Construction firms that did security work over the past 30 years were an important source of employment. Those bases that were not strengthened and properly equipped for the terrorist attacks that they had to withstand have now been strengthened. There is an expectation at the moment and, like the rest of us, I hope to God that it is not a false expectation. I have a great deal of doubt about the durability of the current ceasefire, but if there is the reduction in terrorism that we all hope for, and in so far as police stations and other mililtary bases have been upgraded, there will a lessening of opportunity in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those firms are now finding it difficult to get ordinary civilian-type work because they are still associated with working for the security forces. People feel that to use them for civilian-type work places them under threat. I ask the Minister to look carefully at enabling these firms to reposition themselves, to form joint-venture operations as some of them are attempting to do. I have many other questions but I will desist from asking them. I hope that we can discuss that issue in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As much of the ground has been well and truly ploughed I will make just one or two short, and hopefully succinct, points of emphasis. Everyone is aware that the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis has had a particulary bad effect on Northern Ireland where perhaps the highest propotion of meat production of any part of the United Kingdom was for export. It is also ironic that Nothern Ireland farmers should be punished perhaps the most severely for that while they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
were the most assidous in cattle tracing and had excellent procedures for ensuring that the product was safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is laudable for the Government to encourage investment and make money available to the IDB for new jobs, the biggest employer in Northern Ireland is the agricultural industry. If producers and farmers suffer not only a drastic reduction in income but severe damage to their capital investment they may be put out of business for good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If arrangements could be made for making money available, almost on an emergency basis for the amelioration of their present position, it would be a great help, particularly as their predicament is largely not of their own creation but the result of the mistaken and mismanaged policies of the previous Government on that cattle condition. I ask the Minister to give special attention to the plight of the farming community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning briefly to education, I welcome the £8 million that is to be spent annually on capital investment in the fabric and building of schools, but there is an imbalance between the state sector and the voluntary schools. There is an excellent grammar school in my constituency, Glenlola, which has achieved an excellent teaching record in abysmal physical conditions that have been declared unhygienic and unsafe. If they were the subject of factory inspectors instead of education inspectors they would be condemned. The headmaster is conscious of the fact that excellent efforts by the staff and support groups are still ensuring good results, but while that continues the physical conditions and the plight of the teaching staff are being ignored. In other words, there is no reward for excellence in making do with poor conditions. Those involved are instead penalised, the principle being that if staff are doing well in those awful conditions, nothing really needs to be put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of many speeches has been the plight, or the suggested plight, of preparatory schools in Northern Ireland. The fons et origo or the policy of removing or seriously diminishing Government funding for those schools seems to be a report of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, paragraph 3.14 of which states:
	<br><q><p>"Debate on educational funding is often stifled by warnings of scarce resources. In this context, the Commission notes the DENI's funding of preparatory schools in the voluntary and controlled sectors. These schools receive public subsidies of just under £1.5 million which is, in effect, 'a transfer of money to middle-class parents'."</p></q>
In my humble opinion, that conclusion is erroneous because the greater proportion of children at those preparatory schools are not middle class. Their parents may be from the upwardly-mobile working class; artisans who are making a tremendous effort and making sacrifices to fund their children at the schools. Apart from that, however, those parents pay 60 per cent. of the cost of their children's education. If that arrangement is withdrawn, 3,500 children in those preparatory schools could conceivably be thrown back on to the state system, where 100 per cent. of their education would have to be paid for by the state. Instead of a saving of £1.5 million there would be an

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
increase of £3·5 million in expenditure. One wonders whether the Minister will reconsider the financial and economic basis of the assessment, and whether the figure of £1·5 million has been reached by departmental officials who have conducted exercises and who know what they are about, or is a straight grab from the SACHR report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like some other hon. Members who have spoken, I have been inundated with correspondence not from middle-class people but from people who care about their children's future and are prepared to make significant sacrifices for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the first meeting of the Grand Committee. There is a Grand Committee for Scotland and one for Wales and I am delighted that we now have one for Northern Ireland, so that we have parity in that respect with the rest of the United Kingdom. I hope that we shall go further than that in the near future and do away with the Orders in Council by which we are treated like a colony. Bills on matters relating to Northern Ireland should go through the House in a proper manner and we should be treated in the same way as people in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a new Member and am interested in figures, and I have been trying to reconcile the figures before the Committee. Conservative estimates for the year 1998–99 gave a figure for expenditure in Northern Ireland of £8,256 million. That is confirmed by the Northern Ireland economic councils which used the same figures. They added to them all the extra moneys that we are told are coming from the Labour Government and reached a total of £8,3677 million. However, the Department's document seems to give a total of £8,289 million. Even if we add the £13 million of capital receipts from the sale of houses, which seems to be excluded, there stills seems to be a deficit of £65 million. Perhaps when the Minister replies he will explain where the £65 million has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that in the previous Government's estimates there was to be a reduction in expenditure of 1·3 per cent. in real terms. Even with the Government's extra money, there would still be a real reduction of 1·2 per cent. If the missing £65 million is added, it is still a further reduction in real terms. Let the Minister explain those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that the income from income tax and from other Northern Ireland taxes has gone up greatly in the past few years, and that therefore the amount of overall grant aid to Northern Ireland has decreased by almost £300 million to £400 million? If we are handing back £300 million to £400 million, does the Department not think that perhaps the Government might be kinder and give us more money back, rather than taking it away? Perhaps the Minister will clarify that situation, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak about expenditure on education especially as it relates to further education colleges. As the Minister knows, those colleges are being incorporated and they will be responsible for their own operations. They will incur considerable additional
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
expenditure, for example, I understand that under the old regime, health, education and library boards had their own insurance schemes which also covered the colleges. Now, because they are being incorporated the colleges' expenditure on insurance will be much greater. Perhaps the Minister will tell me if they will also have to pay VAT and, if so, how much it is likely to be. Will the Department give the colleges extra money to meet such charges? The colleges also have a backlog of maintenance costs amounting to millions of pounds. Are the Government willing to give them more money to meet such costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support those hon. Members who have spoken about the BSE crisis in Northern Ireland. We were told that there has been a 37 per cent. drop in farmers' incomes. Surely, with the additional money from tax and VAT in Northern Ireland, the Government could find a way to give back some of that money to needy farmers to help them to survive. Agriculture is one of Northern Ireland's main industries. Our retail shops depend upon it and if the farmers' income is down, everything else is down. I ask the Minister to see to it that expeditious aid is given to farming in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister spelt out some of the extra expenditure that will, through budgetary or other avenues, be provided for Northern Ireland. The previous Government's legacy is serious, and it is set out in Cm 3616. Table 12.8, which I quoted earlier, shows that, under the Conservatives' plans for 1998–99, there was to be a fall of £214 million in public expenditure from 1996–97 levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the table is studies in detail, it becomes clear that that is a serious fall from the peak years of 1991–92 to 1996–97. That leads to serious reductions in many areas. For example, spending on law and order was planned to decrease by £137 million at 1995–96 constant prices when compared with 1993–94. Cuts of £48 million were planned for the total agriculture and fisheries bill, and of £37 million for industry, £33 million for transport and £57 million for housing. If those cuts are added together and are then subtracted from the peak years, it shows a reduction of £572 million in constant prices. The only figure that would counter that trend was an increase in social security payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government face a serious backlog of problems. Despite the additions in expenditure that have been mentioned, criticisms have been made in Northern Ireland about the Labour Government's determination to act within certain spending limits. The Northern Ireland committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has expressed that concern strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's usual argument is that they have a manifesto commitment to stay within the spending limits and that they will do so for two years, but it is difficult to argue that the manifesto commitment applies to Northern Ireland. The Labour party has no organisation in Northern Ireland, and ran no candidates in Northern Ireland. Therefore, extra
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
consideration must be given to the position of Northern Ireland. However, the blanket argument about the manifesto commitment is used for each area of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
High interest rates and a strong pound affect Northern Ireland's manufacturing industry and the moneys that come from the European Union. The common agricultural policy and structural funds are affected seriously by such factors. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will have a word with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer about these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a problem with regional aid. The fact that we still use Conservative unemployment figures means that the unemployment figures for Northern Ireland, which are higher than elsewhere, are artificially low. Therefore, the grounds for claiming structural fund money from the European Union are undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland has a higher proportion of the population receiving disability living allowance than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. I hope that the statements put out about what will happen to the allowance will be seriously re-examined, and especially after last night's vote. I hope also that the Government will not go down the path of hitting some of the most deprived people in Northern Ireland. That would be transferring money from the poor to other members of the poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the European peace package money, it might be a technical concern but peace funds have not been allocated from the second round of European Union payments. The Government may up their contribution but the documents show a considerable decline, which is a matter of concern to bodies such as the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee for long. It is important, however, that we have the opportunity in this Northern Ireland Grand Committee to challenge the Government on their spending plans. I broadly welcome the extra money that has been invested this year, particularly in education and health. It would be churlish to say otherwise. Speaking as an ex-Minister with responsibilities for health in Northern Ireland, I am envious of the current Minister, who seems to have negotiated through the corridors of the Department of Finance and Personnel far more money than I ever managed to obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is disingenuous of the Government to claim that they have kept to the previous Government's spending targets when the figures show that the total NI block has increased by £59 million. We know that most of the money going into education and health either came from reserves—a one-off that cannot be repeated—along with, as the document shows, the £59 million that was added to the base
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
budget for Northern Ireland. It cannot therefore be claimed that the Government have followed the spending plans of the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It did not take me long to spot a mistake in the figures. The first column shows that the original figures for spending on health and personal social services for 1998–99 amounted to £1,674 million. Yet the book produces the figure of £1,647 million—a difference of £30 million. Will the Minister tell the Committee exactly where that £30 million has gone? The hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) spoke of £65 million going missing; now I have added another £30 million—a total of £95 million. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is all right for Opposition Members to laugh, but it is important if the figures in the book and the figures issued to Members do not tally. It seems that £30 million has gone adrift, which is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask three questions. First, why has an extra £6 million been allocated for criminal damage compensation—including bomb damage—when concession after concession has already been given to Sinn Fein-IRA. The Government say that they are hopeful of a successful outcome to the peace process but allocations are already being made in next year's budget in compensation for bomb damage. It would be useful to have some comment about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, £30 million is being taken out of the housing budget. As an ex-Minister for the environment in Northern Ireland, I realise that that was an obvious sector to raid for extra money and reallocations. I resisted such sums being taken out of the housing budget for obvious reasons. It is incumbent on the Minister to tell us what will be the impact of the reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is a reduction of £4 million in the roads budget. When I left the Department, expenditure was such as to prevent new road building for the foreseeable future. Taking off another £4 million means eating into the maintenance budget. The Minister must explain whether the roads in Northern Ireland will be maintained at an acceptable level. The Department and the Roads Service always told me that we could not afford to decrease the maintenance budget, even by £1, because of safety implications and the medium-term effects of putting more money back into the budget to maintain the roads in the right condition. I hope that the Minister has plenty of time to answer those few simple questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting, especially because of the difference in atmosphere between this year and last year. Last year, we discussed 3 per cent. cuts in the health budget and mass redundancies in schools. Today's debate has reflected our good progress in turning the budget round. We have not yet achieved nearly as much as we aim to accomplish, but an important change has occurred. Reasonable hon. Members appreciate that I cannot respond today to every point that was raised, but I shall ensure that I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
reply to all the points through letters. I shall take no interventions; otherwise, I shall be able to respond to even fewer points. Further meetings of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee will take place and I understand that hon. Members are keen to discuss education and health. We shall concentrate on those topics in future meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by talking about social exclusion, which the hon. Members for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Godman) and for South Down mentioned. I attended the launch of the social exclusion unit in Stockwell on Monday. The unit in Great Britain will maintain close links with Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is a long way ahead of other parts of the United Kingdom in its practices and structures for dealing with social exclusion, because it is familiar with discussing targeting social need or policy appraisal and fair treatment. Our initiatives will not simply follow others; we shall continue to lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of the preparatory departments of the voluntary grammar schools was raised often. A comprehensive spending review is taking place. It is considering every item on which we spend money. The sum of £1·5 million is allocated to preparatory departments to subsidise fee-paying schools. Parents pay 60 per cent. and the state pays 40 per cent. We have discussed that contribution with voluntary grammar schools, and we held a positive meeting with the Governing Bodies Association earlier this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be foolish to introduce a cut that cost more than it saved. However, a subsidy cannot continue in perpetuity without being examined. Some people claim that £1·5 million is not a large sum, but I could provide 1,300 nursery school places with that money. I shall examine the way in which we spend money to ensure that we obtain the best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members claim that only aspiring working class parents pay for the schools. That is often said, but no evidence is produced. Assistance to parents is not means tested. A block grant of £400 per pupil is paid, and the pupils' means or needs are not taken into account. I shall return to that issue and others in the next month or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all accept the seriousness of the agricultural industry's predicament. Hon Members will understand that I cannot say anything substantive today, although, as the hon. Member for North Antrim and other hon. Members are aware, discussions and negotiations with the European Commission are taking place at the highest levels. Labour Members realise that the situation is serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private finance initiative was referred to by several hon. Members. We all recognise that there has been substantial under-investment in the public buildings of Northern Ireland—the schools, hospitals and so on. That is one of the most serious problems of neglect that we have to consider. In education alone, the amount of under-investment is about £350 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are exploring the private finance initiative. One project in education is almost signed, sealed and delivered: at the North West Institute for further and higher education. There are also a couple of school projects that will come on stream this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
As the hon. Member for Hull, North mentioned, we might need to reconfigure the private finance initiative. The costs involved for the private contractors are a disincentive to small-scale projects. At the weekend, the Scottish press reported that a private finance initiative was put forward for five schools in the Falkirk area. That is a valuable way of bundling projects together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) raised the issue of the problems of the construction industry. I am aware of them. I recently visited the Construction Industry Training Board and was delighted—from my own viewpoint, although not from that of Northern Ireland to be told that I was the first Minister to visit the Board for over 20 years. That shows that we need to give more attention to such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commonality in the education budget is an important issue. At the annual meeting of the education and library boards—which I think that the hon. Member for East Antrim attended—I announced that I was pursuing commonality. We cannot justify seven ways of funding schools for a population of 1.6 million. Each of the education and library boards allocates funds in a different way, with Department of Education for Northern Ireland funding for integrated schools and grammar schools. It is evident from our proceedings today that that leads to sourness and bitterness. People continually assert that schools of different persuasions are funded in a fair or an unfair way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those assertions about unfair funding are made constantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards, the grammar schools and the integrated schools are partners in this matter. In consultation with them, we want to apply common values to funding and to have common funding. It would be just for schools with the same characteristics, in terms of pupils and surroundings, to be funded equally, wherever they were in the Province. That would be our goal. We want to make the matter transparent, but there are difficulties of balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was last in debate with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, he accused me of ignoring him. This is my second reference to matters raised by him today. He mentioned the issue of small schools. We have to take into account the fact that different boards fund small schools in different ways. We are currently considering the weighting of funding for such schools. If extra weighting is given to a small school, however, it must by definition be taken away from some other area. The point that he raised is very much in our thoughts at present. I hope to make a statement soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a general welcome, and a generous and typical one, from the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), my predecessor as the Minister responsible for health, expressing envy of the way that extra money has been screwed out of the system for health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not in reserves. I took the budget that the hon. Gentleman left for last year and found an extra £19·5 million for health which is going straight into patient care services. All hon. Members will know from their constituency work just how important community care and waiting lists are. There is no difference between us on that. The last proposal that I made nearly a fortnight ago for an extra £7·5 million to go into waiting list initiatives and community care has been generally welcomed and we will continue with that initiative next year.

I will not say anything about reorganisation of the Belfast hospitals because, for those who want more of this, an Adjournment debate follows on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that an extra £1·3 million will go into the libraries this year. One of the most unfortunate acts of the previous Government was to cut the block grant by something like 50 per cent. That will not fund the libraries as adequately as we want. The next few years will be extremely exciting for libraries, particularly because they will also be coming into the national grid for learning when we link up all schools to the internet. There is an opportunity there for people to rethink what libraries are about. We cannot continue with the library model that we had when we were growing up. Their potential for growth and development as information centres of all kinds is considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) asked about after-school clubs and asked whether Northern Ireland would be involved. I am delighted to say that it is a United Kingdom initiative so there will be a 4·5 per cent. share of the extra £200 million that the Chancellor announced is being allocated to those 30,000 after-school clubs. That reflects what we see as the need within Northern Ireland and will be a substantial contribution. I hope that all hon. Members will seek to find ways in which they can contribute to the thinking on how after-school clubs should develop. There will be a substantial educational component to them, but thought will be needed about the other components too.

Benefit fraud was mentioned. Obviously it is a matter of great concern to us. I want to praise our social security staff. There were incidents last year when they were working on fraud, as hon. Members would want, and their own safety was too much under threat, but that will not stop us from tackling the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Targeting for social need is an immensely complicated issue. Everyone would agree that there should be targeting of social need, but it is not the dominant share of the budget that one might have thought after listening to some hon. Members—it is only about 6 per cent. of the budget. We must decide on the fairest way of allocating it and on what offers the greatest value. We are assessing that at present. So far we have used the yardstick of free school meals as a way of deciding whether areas are deprived. I make no commitment but, as national testing, key stage testing and baseline assessment advance, we may be able to use educational yardsticks much more than we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
have done to date. The issue of whether some of the resources should go to grammar schools was raised with the Governing Bodies Association. A useful meeting was held on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raced through many of the points that have been raised. I have enjoyed the debate, and I hope that other members of the Committee have, too. We shall have the chance to return to these matters in more depth at an early stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the opportunity of raising an issue that is especially appropriate after a debate on public expenditure. Originally, the acute hospital reorganisation project was brought into being as a value-for-money exercise. I am also happy to debate the issue now, because we had much longer than I was led to believe we would have on the motion before the Grand Committee. When we raised a point about asking questions, we were told that we had limited time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to this debate on Belfast City hospital and the Royal Group of Hospitals is the eastern health board's proposals for reorganisation. The various parties worked together and came up with proposals. As a result, Dr. McKenna was asked to examine them and produce another report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because perception means a lot in Northern Ireland, some thought that a doctor would have key objectives at the back of his mind. The first would be to preserve the Royal and the other would be to preserve the Mater, and particularly maternity provision there. When the report finally came out, people were amazed to discover that it came down in favour of siting the new maternity provision on the City site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 25 years and more, some within the obstetrics profession have argued for a new and modern hospital in the centre of Belfast that is able to cater for 5,000 to 6,000 confinements a year. They do not mind where it is sited as long as it is built. However, the harsh reality is that value-for-money considerations suggest that it will be well down the road before that will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, some people have objected to the report's findings. However, similar problems are experienced in other places and the Minister earlier alluded to the problems in Glasgow. I do not know whether the problems in Glasgow are as bad as those in Belfast, but 40-odd years ago there were plans afoot under the late Sir Henry Biggart for a new Belfast central hospital that would combine the City and the Royal. I am afraid that the medical fraternity have their own ways of workings, and nothing happened even though some piecemeal work developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
Immediately the McKenna report was published, we began to have the shroud waving and a campaign from the Royal Group in particular. I say that advisedly, because we were told about the number of babies that would die as a result of provision on the City site. Regrettably, in my judgment, workers, patients and others in the City have never campaigned, as they should, for their own provision. As a result, I suspect that they have sometimes been ignored because they have been prepared to work together for the common good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the McKenna proposals, the City would lose the casualty department, the fractures department and others. However, concern was expressed about paediatric provision and I began to ask questions. I found, of course, that records were not held centrally. I can never understand, Mr. Atkinson, why, in a Province of 1·5 million people, with a health Department and a management executive, figures cannot be pooled and kept centrally so that the information is at our fingertips. It may, of course, be an old Government ploy to enable Ministers to say that they cannot answer our questions and to give as little information as possible. That matters may have to be addressed in the freedom of information Act so that we can get the answers that we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for the Royal group, which carries out virtually the same number of deliveries as the Jubilee group, did not show a greater degree of effective care. My first three daughters were delivered in the Royal and I do not criticise the hospital, but over the years, the figures for deliveries in the Jubilee group have been very good, and perinatal mortality is actually lower in the City. We were told about all the children who had died, or who might have died; I discovered that of those who had to be transferred to the Royal group from the Jubilee, only one died—a youngster in the children's hospital who had a cardiac condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy with the emotional arguments; I recognise that the Minister called for the review to consider clinical effectiveness, but matters were not examined as carefully as they might have been. For example, did the review committee look at the Royal's plans? I know that it carefully examined the City plans. When it is said that a hospital must be on such and such a site, will that lead to a change in Government thinking—will a new maternity hospital be built alongside Great Ormond Street hospital or in Liverpool or will the provision of services in Southampton and Basingstoke be rationalised—when it is obvious that there is no acute paediatric provision close to the maternity hospital, that was actually in Belfast? I realise that the issue has moved on, but I raise it because those real issues are not always considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we face at the moment is a political argument: the position taken in north-west Belfast works to the exclusion of south-east Belfast. At the same time, what I would respectfully call the medical mafia have, over the years, considered the Royal the place of preeminence. I would be the last to undermine the excellence of the Royal but there is no justification for implying that the services in Belfast City hospital, for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
example, are any less effective. In some respects they may be ahead of the Royal. For example, beds in the City cardiology unit have been blocked because staff are waiting for surgeons in the Royal to provide operating facilities. The issue causes great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) referred to maternity. The history is that obstetric and gynaecology beds were linked with beds in private nursing to qualify as a midwifery unit. Advance thinking should have sited the new hospital now being built on the Crumlin road in another part of the Province adjacent to Belfast where the requisite modern health services could have been provided. Yet a small maternity unit, which does not meet the requisite standards, is being kept in north Belfast while at the same time an excellent centre in the south of the city is being closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to ask questions at different levels. Some answers have been objective but we have also received the holding answer—that the question will be answered as soon as possible. I regret that we do not have at our finger tips the information that we need to make the right decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 3 of the report of the medical review panel states:
	<br><q><p>"The RGH submissions"—</p></q>
that of the Royal Group of Hospitals—
	<br><q><p>"focused on an option to refurbish existing accommodation in the Royal Maternity Hospital; although an option to build a new unit was considered, it was not worked up in detail."</p></q>
Another report made it clear that there was
	<br><q><p>"no provision in the Management Executive's Capital Development Plan for a newly built regional maternity/neonatal unit on either site".</p></q>
May I ask the Minister whether money will be made available in the near future to build that provision, and what money will be spent to improve facilities in the Royal Maternity while the rebuild in the main corridor in the Royal is taking place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the impact of the Jubilee's closure on the City. There could be 300 job losses in an area of south Belfast with the highest percentage of female unemployment in Northern Ireland. It is too often forgotten that providing good medical services requires auxiliary staff as well as obstetricians, paediatricians, anaesthetists and specially trained nurses. After a closure, those with the necessary qualifications will move on to new posts, but there will be job losses among the lower paid ranks. Worse, the three wards of Shaftesbury, Blackstaff and Botanic already suffer the greatest deprivation in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 200 beds are vacant in the new tower block so I want to ask whether there are any development plans. How will those beds be filled? How in the modern world can we justify keeping them? Will the accident and emergency unit come back to the City under a change of plans? Ambulance services transferred 150 to 200 patients from the Mater, where facilities were unavailable, to the Royal and to the City. When the Ards hospital closed, patients were transferred to Down and to Antrim because, with the projected

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
closure of the City, accident and emergency facilities were unavailable in Belfast. That means patients have to be transported even greater distances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's views. That is why I have argued for more than 20 years that the new Mater hospital should not be built on the Crumlin road site, but at Corr's corner or in Whiteabbey to provide modern hospital facilities there. It is strange to close hospitals in a growth area of the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City hospital is supposed to be the centre of excellence for cancer services. Will contiguous services be provided there? Will the lung cancer service be transferred to City hospital to provide the concentration of expertise that some people claim to be necessary? Under the McKenna report, colo-rectal services were moved to the Royal Victoria hospital. Will they return to the City hospital?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review committee recommended that the two trusts should work together. The Minister confirmed that the City supported that. But is there evidence to show that the Royal Victoria will give up anything to another hospital? It girned even when, despite work that the Ulster hospital was able to undertake, money was transferred from its budget to the Royal and the City. The Royal Victoria claimed that it needed the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Steps should be taken not only to protect some people's jobs in south Belfast but to provide the best services. Although it has been calculated that people who are booked into the Jubilee hospital will attend the Royal, I suspect that many of them will go to Lisburn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.17 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) on choosing the subject of the debate, which is important to his constituency and to other constituencies. I pay tribute to him for his role over the years as the leading voice for health and social services among Northern Ireland Members. That statement may cause trouble! I shall not be able to cover all the points that have been made about hospital provision in Belfast or Northern Ireland in the time available. However, I can deal with most of the important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of his speech, the hon. Member for Belfast, South referred to "the best services". When I took office, my aspiration was to provide the best services. Sometimes there is a conflict between the best and the most convenient services. People have tremendous loyalty to their local hospital, which is often the biggest employer in the area. Therefore, hospitals are important to their areas. However, all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
medical advice states that we should concentrate resources, and provide teams of staff and quality arrangements for some surgical procedures, especially for high quality medicine. That message is being considered throughout Northern Ireland as each board considers the right configuration of hospital services for its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we came to office we were faced with the outstanding issue of the Royal and City. The topic was immensely controversial. The Opposition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had said that the decision was one that we would review. It had caused great controversy and the accusations or assertions that were made in that context concerned above all the medical consequences—particulary the danger to very young children—of patients being moved from the City hospital. I had to decide how to deal with that issue. It seemed to me that the only way to proceed in a fraught situation involving strong emotions was to call in a team of eminent outsiders, who could appraise the issue. We told them that the issue for them to consider was clinical effectiveness—I think that that was the phrase used in the terms of reference. We wanted from them a judgment, in medical terms, about the right thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal and City hospitals are great institutions that play a vital part in the life of the people of Belfast and Northern Ireland generally. They have great reputations that closely linked to their roles as centres of excellence in teaching and research. Thousands of lives—of patients and staff—are affected by them. Both hospitals have vital roles for the future. We accept the main findings of the McKenna report about the different emphases of the hospitals. Those seem to make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important—I am sure that this will be taken in the spirit in which it is intended—to note that elsewhere in Northern Ireland distances between hospitals are measured in tens or scores of miles, and to realise that the hospitals that we have been considering are one mile apart. When we talk about accessibility people elsewhere find it difficult to give due weight to such distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accessibility of either hospital should not be a major problem, especially as they are regional hospitals. Patients from all over Northern Ireland travel every day to one or other of the hospitals to benefit from their wide range of regional facilities. Our priority must be the good of the patient, and one way to protect that is to ensure that the volume of work undertaken in a top-quality hospital that is a regional resource is great enough, and that there is enough specialisation, to allow skills to develop. When I was considering the issue, the unanimity of the Royal and City hospitals about the need for one unit was striking. There was no disagreement about that. The disagreement was about where it should be. Doctors and specialists recognised that quality would improve on unification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Eastern board was the first to conduct a review of acute services, in line with the regional strategy. That will lead to some reconfiguration. However, we want to end the unnecessary duplication of services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
between the two Belfast hospitals. We cannot afford such duplication, given the shortage of funds that will always exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was achieved in the four reports was remarkable. Allocation of about 30 specialties was covered. Two problems emerged. One concerned maternity and the other dermatology. I am at present considering allocating to the City or the Royal. In the report the Royal was seen as a major centre for trauma. We accept that finding judgment. That finding meant that services linked or directly related to that role—neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, regional intensive care and accident and emergency—should continue there. The City, on the other hand, was seen as developing as a centre of molecular medicine with on-site services such as nephrology, transplantation, genetics and cancer services although there would always have to be a core of common services on both sites such as anaesthesia, radiology and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the publication of that document, the acute hospitals reorganisation project has sought through its later recommendations to keep as close as possible to the original outline plans. It has been said that the Royal never gave anything up. A number of services such as urology, clinical haematology, vascular surgery and the breast clinic are all to move to the BCH from the RGH. The other services have gone the other way. In the space that has been freed the City has developed the new day procedures unit, which is very important to it. There has been co-operation on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was enormous controversy about the maternity issue. In the end, having carefully read the report of the Donaldson inquiry where outsiders were simply judging clinical effectiveness, I felt that I had to accept their judgment. I was particularly impressed by their conclusion that the most pressing requirement is to bring together the maternity, neonatology and gynaecology services currently spread between the BCH and RGH sites. It was felt that until that was done the services would not reach their full potential. If we accept the McKenna recommendation, we would seal off the best option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
Conclusion 4 states:
	<br><q><p>"Whilst an interim solution that maintains the separation between the neonatal unit and the specialist paediatric services is sustainable in the short term, in the longer term it will impact on clinical effectiveness adversely by inhibiting the development of high quality services."</p></q>
That seemed an important finding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister mention Belvoir?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will, but in the most cautious terms for reasons that the hon. Gentleman will understand. We have had an option appraisal of the cancer services, which has come up with the unanimous recommendation that the services at Belvoir Park should move to the City so as to establish top quality provision for cancer services. That conclusion is now out for consultation. That is why I cannot say anything about my decision. I will weigh that up. Once again, the judgment I make will not be based upon pressure. It will be based upon what seems to be the best way ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have accepted the Donaldson report recommendation on maternity services. Donaldson has gone for the best. We will save some money at the City in that some of the proposed adaptations there will not now need to take place. When services are agreed to be moved from the Royal to the City savings can be expected on the £65 million building programme for the Royal. We have asked the Royal to prepare a business plan and to examine the possibility of a private finance initiative for the new hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Mater was mentioned quickly. This is a matter for the Eastern board in its appraisal of services. The Eastern board values the Mater and buys its services. That may change in future, but at present the Mater provides a valuable service. That is all that I can say about that. While its services are up to what is required by the Eastern board and fit into its plan it will go ahead. The decisions that were made on the maternity services were seen to be taken in a fair, open way. There was no attempt at cost-cutting but an attempt was made to help the people of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
