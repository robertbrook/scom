	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), I should point out that there is a corrigendum on the Table. It is a straightforward reprint of page 41—the line numbers were wrong on the original. It will not arise until we reach clause 58, but I know that hon. Members read the Bill closely and might have been confused by the original line numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 48</div> <!-- clause -->

	<div class='title'>STOPPING UP AND DIVERSION OF CROSSINGS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed [16 January],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to try to persuade the Committee that clause 48 was unnecessary last Thursday when the Government Whip intervened to suggest that we defer considering until this morning. All members of the Committee, and certainly all hon. Members who spoke on Second Reading, are extremely concerned about the safety of rail crossings, particularly for pedestrians. All who read the report of the incident at Doncaster have been horrified by it. Accidents involving pedestrians on rail crossings are, fortunately, rare although accidents on level crossings in general are far too frequent; on most occasions they involve people in vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) said that the horror and trauma of the accident were experienced not only by those injured and killed and their relatives, but by the engine drivers involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole Committee wants improved safety on all level crossings, especially those used by people on foot or on horseback. British Rail's approach seems to be to abolish crossings rather than to make them safe. It is unfortunate that it took a long time for the Health and Safety Executive to make its recommendations on how level crossings could be made safer. I hope that, following consultation on that document, British Rail will act speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also regrettable that despite having had the powers to install warning lights for pedestrian crossings on railways, I could not find—nor could the Minister in a parliamentary answer—any sites where British Rail had done so. If British Rail were concerned about safety, it would surely have looked at one or two places where a substantial number of people use a crossing and where, because of the increased speeds of trains, just looking up the line to see whether it was clear was not satisfactory and installed the system of signals that are used on crossings used by cars. It has not done that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Rail's approach has been simply to say that crossings should be closed. I argue that it is unnecessary to
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
do that because under the Highways Act 1980, as amended by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, there are sufficient powers for British Rail to divert such crossings. It would be far more reasonable for it to use those powers. If the crossings are not used there is no safety problem and British Rail can close the path under the Highways Act 1980. There is no need for a new procedure, because sufficient powers already exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ramblers Association is not convinced that the case for new procedures for rail crossing diversion and extinguishment orders has been made. Furthermore, the rights of way review committee, which is an informal, non-statutory committee chaired by the hon. Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. Haselhurst), is not convinced that the new power is needed. Normally, Governments need much persuasion before they introduce a new statutory procedure, yet the enabling clause 48 and schedule 2 will give the Government a new procedure for closing footpaths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When British Rail submitted evidence to the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure, it referred to the Highways Act 1980 as originally passed and not as amended in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. At that stage, it did not seem to be aware that the proposals had changed. That amendment was suggested by the rights of way review committee, which at that time was chaired by the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer). It allows orders to be made to divert public footpaths and bridleways in the interests of the owner of land or in the interests of the public. As British Rail owns the land, it can ask for a diversion in its interests: in many cases it can also argue that a diversion will be in the public's interest because it may make the crossing safer. That shows that grounds for a diversion order already exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that, in the west country, British Rail realises that it has sufficient powers because earlier last year an order to divert a path was made under the existing power by Taunton Deane council in Somerset. At Tursdale in Durham, British Rail is trying to gain parliamentary approval to divert a dangerous crossing. The crossing is subject to the provisions in the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill, which came before Parliament in the previous Session and has been reintroduced in this Session. Unfortunately, British Rail is being obstinate about paying the county council's costs of making the order. If BR is worried about safety, surely it should be only too willing to pay the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. Although I do not wish to appear to defend British Rail—that is the Minister's job, as he appoints the board—surely part of the delay is due to its attempt to persuade the county council to meet some of the costs on the ground that local residents and local users of the Tursdale crossing will be protected. British Rail has financial constraints and argues that the county council should help to defray the costs of making the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree that that sounds reasonable, but if everyone says that the crossing is dangerous, it is appalling that either British Rail or the council should delay the order. If a diversion has been agreed on safety grounds, surely the necessary work should be done and the argument over responsibility for the costs should come later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
If British Rail were to install lights on crossings, many would be safer, but I do not want to embark on that argument now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Dixon 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Jarrow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite what my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) says, British Rail is reluctant to pay for safety requirements. There has been an argument in my constituency about an alternative crossing—at a cost of £70,000—to the Newton Garths crossing, where a six-year-old girl was killed and where a lorry was hit just six weeks ago. British Rail has at last admitted responsibility and will meet the costs, but only after 15 to 18 months of argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get drawn into the details of events in the north-east, but I accept the anger of my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) that British Rail claims in Parliament to be anxious about safety, yet is reluctant to act in individual cases. Therefore, is it necessary to give it new powers? I believe firmly that it is not; it already has the power to divert footpaths, to implement the recommendations of the health and safety legislation and to control crossings by lights. There is much evidence that the record of preventing accidents has improved where crossings for vehicles have been controlled by clear lights. British Rail should try out lights on crossings that are used by individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A plethora of Acts on these matters are not consolidated. If reference to rail crossings, incomplete though it is in this part of the Bill, were not included, would not they fall strictly within the terms of the requirement to lay a statutory instrument? Therefore, if other Acts were required to enlarge or create a railway, they would not be covered. Although I agree with many of my hon. Friend's points, would not it be better to try to consolidate the scope of the statutory instrument in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not necessary. The Highways Act, as amended by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, is ever so easy to read and makes quite clear the position regarding diversion of footpaths and bridleways. I do not know why different legislation is needed to deal with railways. British Rail wants the power not to divert but to stop footpaths. The power to stop footpaths if they are not used exists already, but British Rail wants to go further and have the power to stop footpaths when they are used. That is the crux of the argument. If footpaths are dangerous, British Rail should try to confront that danger by installing lights and improving the general safety of the crossings. If it cannot do that, it should be forced to consider a diversion, on the grounds of safety. However, it wants a new power to stop a footpath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with what my hon. Friend is saying, but if, as he believes, British Rail should meet the costs of providing lights or of diverting footpaths, how would that increase the cost of services on a branch line with a dozen or 20 such crossings? If his suggestions are adopted and British Rail meets the costs, what impact would such extra expenditure have on the provision of British Rail services in rural areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get dragged into the argument about cost. I agree that there is a question about the extent to which British Rail should receive grant in aid
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
from the Government for public services, but my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) is not being realistic about branch lines. I do not think that there is a problem. As my hon. Friend probably knows, I walk fairly frequently in north Wales. I am certainly aware of the railway line that runs from Llandudno junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog and of the Cambrian railway line that runs round the coast. Many footpaths cross both those lines and I cannot envisage a train on either line moving so fast that someone could not get out of the way as it approached. Both are single line tracks, so one need look in only one direction and although the trains run at up to 30 mph, crossing the lines is not a problem for pedestrians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem, however, on the east coast main line where trains run much faster. It is argued that greater speed results in greater passenger convenience and if that attracts more passengers, they should pay part of the costs. I do not want to get into a long argument with my hon. Friend, because I think that we agree that the Government should consider support for British Rail in the interests of safety which should not always have to be covered by British Rail's capital costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If British Rail is allowed to close footpaths merely on the grounds that they are dangerous and is not required to propose a diversion which is safer, it could be argued that because someone walking along a footpath might be in danger, the footpath should be closed instead of the relevant bodies having a duty to see that it was made safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a tremendous increase in the number of golf courses all over the country. Farmers who can no longer make a good profit out of the European Community are using their land for golf courses, quite a few of which have footpaths going across them. I know that you have a particular interest in golf courses, Mr. Lamond, but I am sure that despite your enthusiasm, you would not want pedestrians to be denied the privilege of walking across them. I am sure that you would not know anything about this, Mr. Lamond, but occasionally people driving on a golf course do not always get their ball in quite the direction intended. It can go off at an acute angle, so the footpaths along the side of courses must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can reasonably be argued that on a golf course, a footpath can be diverted in the interests of safety. However, it would be wrong to say that when a farmer's field is to be turned into a golf course, pedestrians should not be allowed to walk across it although there was a footpath there before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many instances in which people could recommend that a footpath be closed. In areas where clay pigeon shoots are held, quarries are developed and new roads built, it can be argued that the existing footpaths are no longer safe. It is perfectly reasonable to divert them, but it would be wrong to establish the principle that because a footpath was no longer safe, it should simply be closed. Instead, an alternative should be offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is really interested in safety, there is a major problem involved in closing footpaths, because they tend to be shown on maps. It would be very nice if maps were brought up to date as soon as footpaths were closed, but that does not happen. Many people out walking will be using maps which are up to 50 years out of date. When they come across a footpath which has been legally closed, if it breaks into a journey that they are used to or if it is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
route recommended in a guide book, people tend to ignore the closure and follow the path anyway. Because those people are trespassing, British Rail is covered and cannot be criticised. But if an accident occurs, it is still a tragedy for the train driver, the injured person and the family of someone who is killed. We should resist as far as possible the proposal to close a used footpath. We should consider diverting the path instead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relatively easy to sign a diversion. The vast majority of people will follow a diversion. The clause is unnecessary, but if it is to remain in the Bill the Minister must provide compelling reasons for abandoning the Highways Act, as amended by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, which grants powers to close an unused footpath and to divert a path, in the owner's interest or in that of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that I heard on Second Reading, or read in the notes on clauses or in the other information that has been presented, convinces me that it is necessary to invent a new procedure to close rather than divert footpaths for safety reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has raised a number of issues. First, I shall deal with the need for change. The hon. Gentleman suggests that the present law is satisfactory because if there is no need for a path the railway operator can use section 118 of the Highways Act, and if it should be diverted—or, more accurately, if a new path is created and the old one extinguished—section 119 is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that that will not do. We have to face the fact that some paths with evidence of use are unsafe and may have to be stopped up without any diversion. As the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) rightly said on Second Reading, we have to live in the real world and even a Labour Administration would not accept a commitment to funding the provision of a bridge or underpass at every rail crossing that is judged to be needed, but unsafe. At present, there is no power to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different considerations from those in section 119 apply to rail crossing diversions. They are not so much in the interest of the owners as for the safety of the public. That means, for example, that a more flexible approach should be taken about the relative convenience of the proposed alternative right of way. The diverted path might be less convenient to users—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is incorrect. It is convenient for the user to walk over a bridge or along an underpass because that maintains a straight line. It is convenient for British Rail to provide a diversion because a bridge or underpass is too expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is giving a spending commitment. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is interested in the Opposition's spending commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary invents most of the spending commitments that he attributes to the Labour party. Doubtless, he will now invent another, with the same lack of credibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Footpaths, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to stray too far from footpaths. Hon. Members make commitments; if they
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
then wish to dissociate themselves from those commitments, they cannot blame us for attributing them to those hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the words "even a Labour Administration". I was shocked by that. I believe, and I should have thought that the Minister, his assistants and other Conservative Members would believe, that we are discussing the rights of private citizens, rights of way and the extent to which promoters of railways, whether public or private, should provide proper public facilities. I was surprised—although not too surprised because I know the Minister—that he dragged in a reference not only to public expenditure, which is a matter for a promoter, but to a party issue that does not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party has made no commitment to funding provisions for bridges and underpasses. If those criteria are to apply, British Rail will have to meet the substantial extra cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a subway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks as though it costs nothing to build a subway. It costs a considerable amount. There is the additional question of the safety of subways. Many people think that they are undesirable because they are often badly lit and associated with crime. However, if a diverted path would enable users to cross a railway at a point where there was a bridge or underpass, or where it was practicable and economical to construct a new bridge or underpass, I suggest that it would be a better option than for users to lose the right of way altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals are not anti-rambler. The proposed amendments to the Highways Act 1980 contained in schedule 2 will strike a fair balance between the legitimate interests of users of rights of way and the interests of BR, which has a statutory duty to run a safe railway which it cannot shirk. The proposals will not result in the widespread closure of rail crossings. Users will be able to object to every rail crossing order and BR will have to demonstrate at a public inquiry and to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that there is no reasonable alternative to closure of a crossing. I should explain that, in this context, the Secretary of State is the Environment Secretary, not the Transport Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, railway operators have sought private legislation. Clearly, the Examiners in the House and the Select Committees thought that the powers were necessary. On many occasions, BR has, successfully, proved the preamble to relevant Bills. However, we firmly believe that these issues, which are, in essence, of a local and detailed nature, are better dealt with under the Highways Act procedures than by private legislation. The Joint Committee recognised that and recommended that the Highways Act 1980 should be amended in the way in which we now propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that when that question was put to the Joint Committee, BR was unaware of the amendment to the 1980 Act by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981? Therefore, BR was trying to establish a case which did not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: BR was able to convince those who scrutinise private Bills that the private Bill procedure was the only way to achieve BR's objectives. We are all aware that the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill failed last year on Second Reading and was reintroduced this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
If we do not legislate, BR will continue to turn to the private Bill to seek its objectives. It has been suggested that section 116 of the Highways Act 1980 could be used, but I should be surprised if hon. Members thought that the magistrates court, any more than Parliament, was the right place to deal with such issues. It has also been suggested that the paths existed before the railways and that BR has made them unsafe by running faster trains, so we should make them safe again. If that is the case, we are all guilty, because we have all encouraged BR to operate faster trains and better services. Indeed, according to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East, we have not done enough to encourage BR in that. The truth is that, when railways were first built, safety expectations were lower than they are now. We must deal with the present situation. We must reconcile the general, public policy goal of a safe and efficient service with the public policy goal of freedom of access to the countryside and convenience to local people. Politics is not always about pursuing one objective. It is often about pursuing one objective. It is often about reconciling several different, and often conflicting, objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the railway inspectors issued a draft consultation paper on their requirements for footpaths, bridleways, crossings and railways. Copies have been distributed to members of the Committee. It is an important document because it will guide not only the railway operators but those who must decide such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should mention consultation with the rights of way interest groups, since we have been criticised for falling short in our consultation with inland waterways interest groups. My officials have met the rights of way review committee and the Ramblers Association in preparing the legislation. We have carefully considered their views and made changes where we have judged that it was right to do so. For example, we dropped the proposal in the consultation paper to apply the stopping up of crossings on safety grounds to footpaths crossing roads. My officials have recently written to the review committee confirming which of its proposals we are able to accept and explaining why we cannot agree to others. We hope that it will agree that we have tried to be helpful and have at least met it halfway.

Other matters and proposed changes will be discussed in later debates on schedule 2, but I have been convinced of the necessity for clause 48.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that the Minister's brief is not credible, as he has introduced the red herring that the Labour party cannot meet its spending commitments. He added that he intends to refer the matter to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, whom I know very well—he was my opponent in the West Bromwich, East constituency in 1974. I won that election with the biggest majority that I have ever had, so I am not as terrified of the right hon. and learned Gentleman as the Minister thinks that I should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two sides to the argument and some compromises must be made. I voted for the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill, which named the seven specific level crossings that British Rail proposed to close on safety grounds. I received a number of letters after that debate. Some correspondents, including some members of the Ramblers Association, claimed that I did not have the
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
faintest idea what I was talking about. However, all hon. Members get such letters, sometimes with some justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was incorrect in saying that that Bill failed. It was overtaken by the time factor and reintroduced, but it was not defeated on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It failed to get 100 votes for the closure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it failed to get those 100 votes, but that is not the same as a defeat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the level crossings mentioned in that Bill were regarded by British Rail as the most dangerous of the scores of such crossings on the east coast main line. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) said that British Rail should meet the costs of providing lights at the crossings. He did not make it clear whether he meant all the crossings or merely the seven mentioned in the Bill, but either way the financial commitment would be immense. Not only would warning lights have to be installed at the crossings, but they would have to be maintained and additional staff would have to be taken on. The Government tell us that we live in a competitive world and it must be acknowledged that BR's direct competitors are not required to meet such costs. The Road Haulage Association Ltd. did not pick up the bill when long sections of the Al were upgraded to motorway standard, nor did the coach companies. They are BR's competitors, but it was the taxpayer who picked up the bill. Yet the nonsensical methods of finance that have existed under successive Governments have meant that, until recently, it was BR's responsibility to meet all the costs of level crossing work and improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that BR now has to pick up 50 per cent. of such costs, but that remains a considerable extra burden which its competitors do not have to bear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that BR should install lights at all crossings on the east coast. However, BR should have been serious about improving safety at those crossings. It did not discuss with the local authorities the introduction of diversions at the crossings. That would have been a safe and cheap alternative. Lights might have been appropriate where a simple diversion could not be introduced because of the safety problems caused by the large numbers of people using the crossing. Such lights should have been installed as an integral part of the east coast line electrification scheme. That would have been cheaper than installing them as an afterthought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a view held by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish which I do not necessarily share. Diversions are neither quick nor cheap. Consultations between British Rail and local authorities are often protracted. Consultations between British Rail and the local authority in the Doncaster area have been protracted since that tragic accident occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are strapped for cash and they say to British Rail, "It's not our problem. They are your trains and it's your railway line. You pay the cost." In a sedentary intervention my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) suggested "a subway" as though it were a cheap way of allowing walkers to pass under a main line. But he has wide experience of railway matters and knows that the solution is not that simple. Where trains run at over 100 mph, as they do on the east
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
coast main line, it is expensive to burrow under the track and put in a proper subway. There is no guarantee that people will use the subway, for reasons given by the Minister. On the east coast main line, such subways would cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pounds. I cannot imagine any Administration giving that commitment, or British Rail being prepared to undertake that amount of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish when he attacks British Rail for seeking to close crossings "merely on the grounds of safety". The accident near Doncaster was horrific and tragic. Those involved will not forget it for the rest of their lives. The crossing over the east coast main line crosses five tracks. On the fast lines approaching Doncaster the maximum speed is about, or above, 100 mph. A footpath to a privately owned nature reserve is used sparingly, but that stretch is notorious among train crews, especially drivers, on the east coast main line as being one of the most dangerous, because people have only seven seconds from the appearance of a train going at maximum speed on the fast line to get clear. To use the phrase "merely on the grounds of safety" with reference to closing a crossing stretches all credulity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If BR arranged a footplate ride on the east coast main line, my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish would realise that when approaching the seven crossings mentioned in the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill, there is a perceptible rise in tension in the cab as the driver and his colleagues wonder what they will find as they turn the corner. The removal of that tension by closing or diverting the crossings is both necessary and desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned a point that I made about a subway. I have travelled in cabs and know exactly what my hon. Friend means. I agree with him about inequitable responsibility. When I said "subway" to the Minister, I meant that some effort should be made to make alternative crossings which would not be expensive and would not involve a barrier or a closure. It would be better to find an alternative even if it meant people having to walk a little further and perhaps crossing a light bridge. A light bridge for foot traffic only is a relatively inexpensive structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) and I have tabled amendments to schedule 2 which may satisfy the points made by my hon. Friend. The Ramblers Association and British Rail must accept that compromise is necessary in respect of the Bill; some rights of way will have to be diverted, if that is possible, or closed if no agreement can be reached. I want rights of way to be closed only if they are specified in parliamentary legislation, rather than BR being given carte blanche in this or any other Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the argument about Doncaster. I am sure that my hon. Friend will have carefully considered the Health and Safety Executive's recommendations to make footpaths safer which I had assumed were made in consultation with BR. It is odd that BR did not suggest implementing any of those proposals at the crossings on the east coast main line. The suggestion that is most relevant to the Doncaster case is that of making a safe refuge between the lines. It is difficult for people to cross from one side of a road to another, so a refuge is placed in the middle to enable them to cross half
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
the highway at a time. British Rail should consider something similar at Doncaster, where there are seven lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, my hon. Friend's argument is unrealistic in these circumstances. One cause of that accident was that the wheel of a child's bicycle got caught in the track. Half a dozen refuges on that stretch of the track would not alter that, nor the fact that there were only seven seconds to clear five tracks. Refuges would make no difference to safety if a child's bicycle were stuck in one of the tracks. They would not have saved the mother and children involved in that accident because of their understandable attempt to move the bicycle out of the way as the train was bearing down on them. As I said on Second Reading of the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill, high-speed trains and pedestrians do not mix. Many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee with experience of railway matters will agree with my views although they may not agree with my solutions. Amendments to schedule 2 will attempt to resolve the difficulties although they may not please the fundamentalists on either side. There must be compromises and the amendments were tabled in that spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish will not feel that I am 100 per cent. in British Rail's camp, as I have no reason to be. It paid me pretty inadequately in all the years that I worked for BR and it has never given me the impression that, should the worst happen in my constituency it would welcome me back with open arms. Most of the signal boxes in which I used to work have been knocked down anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). It is remarkable that the Minister has the gall to talk about cost. If any fault can be allocated for the absence of diversions through subways or over bridges it is to the Government. They authorised expenditure on electrification of the east coast main line. The Minister does not travel on that line very often so he may not know that the electrification was not an overwhelming success. It was done under a lightweight construction in which the wires come down relatively frequently. I therefore wrote to the Transport Minister about the costs. The Minister should know that the cost of the east coast main line electrification was £450 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman will be link his remarks to the clause in a minute but he should not wander too far from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Lamond. This is the very basis of my argument; it is not something just to divert the Committee for an hour or so. We have been talking about the cost throughout the debate. It is not an irrelevancy or a side issue. Every hon. Member who has spoken so far has mentioend the cost, either saying that it should be met or that it was irrelevant. The Minister said that he would talk to the Chief Secretary and suggested that the cost of the overhead bridges or subways would be another commitment by the Labour party. Cost is therefore a relevant factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall cost of the electrification of the line on which the 125 mph trains run was authorised by the Government at just over £400 million. The comparative cost of the west coast electrification, which took place
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
many years ago and is a much more reliable system with much stronger structures to carry the overhead catenary wires, is nearly £2 billion. The problems of the number of footpaths crossing it were not unknown to British Rail when it examined the east coast main line. It ought to have submitted the diversion of those footpaths within the application for the electrification of the line. Perhaps it did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The east coast main line was the subject of a private Bill promoted by British Rail—the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill—because of the undoubted problems created by high-speed trains. But high-speed trains were an integral part of the proposal for the east coast main line. Indeed, electrification of the east coast main line was effectively imposed on BR by the Government's criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the relevant question of cost, does my hon. Friend agree that not only the lightweight nature of the catenary wires, which are apt to blow down in the slightest wind, but the cost of these crossings entered the equation? BR must be able to guarantee an 8 per cent. return on its own money before the Government allows it to spend that money. As a result, the safety measures that my hon. Friend would like are not included in these costings and our railway system is built or modernised on the cheap and its services are disrupted the minute that the wind exceeds a certain velocity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I ring BR before travelling to London to ensure that trains are running. The frequency is interrupted so often—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the relevance of the costs of the footpaths being placed against the overall cost of the upgrading of lines but, having made that point, the hon. Gentleman should return to footpaths and not discuss whether the wind prevents trains from running. I understood the point that he was making which were relevant, but he should not continue too far on the issue of overall costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fundamental and important point. My hon. Friend the Member for Penton and Reddish has argued that clause 48 should not stand part of the Bill. It has been said that it should stand part of the Bill because British Rail needs powers to stop up rights of way that cross any line it chooses, not just the east coast main line. As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish made clear, on branch lines, where the speed limit is often 30 mph or 40 mph or even as low as 10, 15 or 20 mph on curves and bends, the need to stop up rights of way for safety considerations is very different from on main lines, where the speeds exceed 100 mph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is importnt to get this in context. It is not just a matter of giving power to BR to stop up these footpaths, but of ensuring that a local inquiry takes place and that a decision is made by the Secretary of State, thus avoiding the need for local issues to be debated under the private Bill procedure. We are perhaps concentrating on the east coast main line because of the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill. In many other cases, as a result of local pressure BR may want to change, divert or close a footpath. The clause establishes an order-making process avoiding the need for a private Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and I argue that the power should be denied
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
because of the Government's failure to make adequate provision from general tax revenue to ensure that rights of way that have been whittled away are maintained. It is unfair that this burden should be placed on BR. It is providing a service that is of no benfit to it; it simply seeks the safe passage of its trains. My hon. Friend has made a perfectly good case. We live in an age when we are encouraging people to have more leisure. The Government's economic policies are giving more leisure time for 2·5 million people; they are not designed to do that but that is the consequence. In such an age, we should encourage more people to go out walking, not divert footpaths by stopping them up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's point that British Rail want to stop up paths, but it wants to do so to reduce costs. The paths represent an unfair cost to British Rail. It is a 19th century inheritance that all these footpaths cross lines. The Government have encouraged British Rail to increase the speeds of trains and on many main lines that has been achieved. High-speed trains are an excellent development by British Rail. The Minister will be shaken to be reminded that that was achieved by a publicly owned industry in a publicly owned engineering work shop. British Rail has been encouraged by the Government to increase the speed of trains, but it wants to do so because it generates more passenger traffic and, therefore, revenue. But the obligation to provide a safe passage across track should not fall exclusively on British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Rail tries to seek assistance from local authorities, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish pointed out, they too, are strapped for cash by the same Government policies. Let us, therefore, have a commitment from the Government that rights of way should not be extinguished. Over the years, many of them have been lost but we should be encouraging their maintenance. Surely we should have a citizens charter for ramblers. There will be no choice because the Government are seeking powers in the Bill to take away the choice of whether to walk along a footpath and cross a railway line safely. The Government should recognise the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is really behind the clause? We know that the Prime Minister, if by some extraordinary fluke the Tories are returned to office, will privatise British Rail. The Government are now stripping away all possible obligations so that the fat-cats in the City, who have benefited by billions of pounds from the sale of public assets in the past few years, will have minimal obligations when British Rail is privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obligation to provide facilities for ramblers should be placed squarely on the general purse. That can be achieved over many years, with the most vulnerable crossings picked out for attention in the near future and included as part of the transport supplementary grant. The Department of Transport pours out money for road use. When a local authority wants to build a ring-road or link-road, it receives TSG as though it were confetti, but requests to meet the costs of providing facilities for people who walk—the Department of Health encourages walking to reduce the incidence of heart attacks and heart disease —is met by stern resistance from the Department of Transport, which claims that it should not have to support such measures. The Department of Transport should meet those costs, and I support my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish who has maintained a consistent attitude in trying to retain the rights of ramblers and footpath users, which is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed by the Minister's response and worried by his intervention in the speech of my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I said that British Rail would make many proposals, that was not what I meant. My intention was to emphasise that we should not associate our discussion today only with the east coast main line. There have been other cases and pressures from hon. Members—we may hear about one such case later—about where action on diversions and stopping up crossings should be taken. I was trying to make the point that we are not just dealing with a private Member's Bill that may be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intervene, but I should have pressed the Minister to give us an idea of the number, which is crucial. If it is a large number, we have a problem. If it is about a dozen, despite the banter about cost across the Committee, Front-Bench Spokesmen and Ministers could at least consider finding some of the money for some of the crossings and make them safe by building subways or bridges. It would have been helpful if the Minister had given us a number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned a case to which I may refer later, but in the case to which I shall refer, British Rail had the power to close a crossing but was reluctant to do so. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) referred to wrangles between local authorities and British Rail. I spent 20 years on a local authority before becoming a Member of Parliament and British Rail was one of the worst bodies with which I had to deal. In a wrangle between British Rail and a local authority over an accident on a crossing, the difference is that the local authority has the residents who live in the area on its neck. British Rail tends to view the matter as a local problem. That is the position in the case to which I shall refer. British Rail has the power to close the crossing in question, but is reluctant to do so. In the past couple of months, it has agreed to close it, but there has been a wrangle about finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that. I noticed that the Minister was seeking guidance when I was pressing him about the number. I was wondering whether he could now tell us the number that he expects to be involved in this procedure. I see that he is shaking his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister cannot give that information now, it would be useful to have it before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an amazing predicament: British Rail states that a major problem exists, that legislation, such as the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill is needed and that if such a Bill is not passed parliamentary procedure should be reformed. Yet when the Opposition challenge the Minister to say how many proposals are involved, he claims that British Rail has not given him that information. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) that we need the information before Report. I am not surprised that British
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
Rail has not given the Minister the information, but I am surprised that he did not demand it to prepare for the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question, "how many?" is crucial to ascertain how far the power is likely to be used, to our consideration of amendments and to the cost. Would the cost break British Rail if it carried out the proposals in some other way? Could local authorities or the Government contribute to the cost? Unless we know the figures, we cannot make such judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how to proceed. If I persuaded the Committee to delete clause 48, schedule 2 would fall. It might be preferable to go through schedule 2 and ascertain whether the Government are prepared to accept some of the amendments to it. The compromise proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East, could then be designed. In view of that, I shall not vote against clause 48. However, if no amendments to the schedule are accepted, I shall return to the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave the stand-part debate, I shall make three observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, rail crossings and relative rights and costs have taken an extraordinary and disproportionate amount of time on the Floor of the House for the past few months, even years. I do not complain about the important debate on schedule 2 that we are about to begin. However, it is extraordinary that, despite our massive transport and national economic policies, we always get into a tangle about the issue. Legislation on it is extensive; local and other arguments are repeated endlessly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) said about relevant costs. The Department of Transport proposes to widen the Canning town flyover in my constituency at a cost of £25 million, and to divert more traffic through the high street, to the disadvantage of pedestrians, because of the closure of a slip road. That is the sort of ridiculous proposal and disequilibrium typical of that extraordinary Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, in our debates on the British Railways Bill in the previous Session, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Sir G. Finsberg) understandably detained the House to consider a footbridge in Hampstead, which crossed both the metropolitan and former Great Central Railway lines. The footbridge was established when the railway was first built. The Bill removed the right to cross the railway. If I had been the Member for Hampstead and Highgate, I, too, would have detained the House on that issue. London Transport or British Rail—which may have been responsible for half a bridge each—did not intend to maintain the bridge or right of way because it was too costly. I want to know whether the word "crossing" in the clause included bridges as well as level crossings, on which we properly concentrated. British Rail's failure to maintain a right of way across a rusty footbridge because it would be too costly to replace, as in the Hampstead example, surely falls within the scope of the clause. If so, it opens up an even wider range of cost cutting than my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish envisaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the schedule specified that it did not apply to crossings by tunnel or bridge. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) might wish to consider what British Rail did in one or two cases—it closed the bridge on the basis
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
that it was an unsafe structure and could reasonably be replaced by a level crossing of the track. As some future time, it could argue that the level crossing was not safe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's timely intervention. The wording of the clause may or may not include bridges or subways, which may be more difficult to maintain. We should consider making the clause specific about whether bridges and subways as well as level crossings, are included or whether the provision applies to only one of the three categories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is covered in part I. An order would be required for extinguishing a right of way, which would obviously lead to a public inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I hope that he will cogitate on whether the scope of clause 48 applies to three or four categories or only to crossings at rail level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our useful and interesting discussion on clause 48 revealed some serious problems and showed three different perspectives on the issue. The amendments seek to tackle genuine anxieties about safety, to take account of the important rights of ramblers and others who want access across a railway line, and to consider the serious accidents that have occurred. We want to resolve all the issues that the amendments raise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) did not hide the fact that his main concerns are those of British Rail. My perspective is that, unlike the Minister—who walks only to and from the nearest ministerial car—I classify myself as a rambler. Like my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East, I have travelled in the front of a railway cab to understand the safety issues from a driver's viewpoint. Tension rises when a high-speed train approaches a crossing that is used by pedestrians because the drivers are aware of the lack of time to alert people to the train's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon), I have had a constituent of mine die on an unsafe crossing on a length of high-speed track. Therefore, I can see the issue from all perspectives, and I understand the need for the compromise that the amendments propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked about the inherited legacy of British Rail. It strikes me that we are effectively talking about the same sort of problems that are addressed in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. In a way, the failure of the Government and of British Rail to take on board the safety considerations of those using the crossings on high-speed railway lines is similar to the attitude which prevailed on the problem of contaminated land. It is now hoped to rectify problems that have developed over a number of years. However, so many years of lack of concern about safety has made it difficult to meet the costs of introducing safety measures. That is why the amendments are so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South is worried that we might not discuss bridges that go over railway lines. The accident involving a constituent killed by a high-speed train took place at a crossing in Towyn. There was a caravan park on the other side of the high-speed railway line and the only access to the site was by crossing the line. Although British Rail initially said that it could not get round the problem because it would be too costly, it made a second bridge available in Towyn so that there was an alternative way of crossing the line. That might be one way round the problem just raised. I was concerned to hear the Minister say that we were not necessarily talking about bridges over railway lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are really talking about the failure over the years to build safety into high-speed railway lines. We cannot redress that failure all in one go, but if the Minister were prepared to accept amendment No. 170—which was originally tabled as amendment No. 13—we would move some way towards satisfying ourselves and the ramblers that although there was a cost involved, there was a commitment in the Bill to providing an alternative. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
would set out the ways in which closing a crossing might be acceptable, whenever it was practicable and the cost could be met. These are important issues for compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a great deal about ensuring safe road crossings, whether by the use of pelican crossings, subways or other methods. Why is not there a level playing field in this respect? We do not have an integrated transport policy in which safety aspects and pedestrians' rights are considered equally in road and rail transport issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 170 would define far more precisely the tests that should be applied to a rail crossing extinguishment order and would, in particular, require the safety of the alternative route to be taken into account. It is no good closing a crossing without any regard for the future safety of pedestrians who may jeopardise their safety even further because we have failed to provide proper alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new section 118A(4) states that the Secretary of State shall have regard to "all the circumstances" when considering whether to confirm an opposed order. We do not think that that goes far enough. The notes on clauses refer to other factors and to guidance through administrative guidelines, but such guidelines will not be produced under the powers given in the schedule and so will not have the force of law. Guidelines could change whenever a new Secretary of State for Transport is appointed. Of course, we hope soon to have some say in that. Permitted changes should be included in the Bill and they should be more reasonable than those now proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a decision by the Secretary of State on an order is challenged by ramblers or by the railway operator—it is the railway operators who refuses to confirm it—the courts, rather than Parliament, will place their interpretation on the meaning of "all the circumstances", and the current administrative guidelines will not be binding. Amendment No. 170 gives Parliament the option to decide the circumstances that have to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 11 requires that the map relevant to an order to extinguish a rail crossing shows the alternative route if the order is confirmed. Under the proposed new section 118A(5), the map has only to show the path or right of way that is being closed; it is not concerned with alternatives for those who use the path. The amendment would ensure that the map shows a path where the public may walk or ride. The public would be better informed and it would also be easier to decide whether the proposal were justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An order may propose the closure not only of the crossing but of the path on either side up to a junction with another path or road. That could be a considerable distance, so the alternative could mean an extra mile or so. All those factors should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 would introduce into the proposed new section 119A provisions contained in the existing section 119 and, in particular, refer to the safety of the proposed diversion. There is no point in a promoter suggesting a diversion if it is less safe than the existing path. The amendment would include in new section 119A the power to protect owners or occupiers of land over which the new path is to be created and who may have concerns that cannot be dealt with solely by the provisions relating to compensation. Those issues are important to the National Farmers Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
Amendment No. 16 requires that the new end of any diverted path be
	<br><blockquote><p>"substantially as safe and convenient for the public"</p></blockquote>
as the end of the path that it replaces. That may seem an obvious requirement, but at present that is not laid down. The amendment would ensure that where a path is being diverted because the rail crossing is unsafe, the replacement path must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"substantially as safe and convenient"</p></blockquote>
as the original path. If it is not, people will take short cuts and the risk of danger will persist. That would be relevent if the alternative proposal meant that people had to walk along a very busy road to gain access to other footpaths and bridleways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have gone into the amendments in some detail and I hope that the Minister will not disregard them in the way that he disregarded the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish in the clause 48 stand part debate. We recognise that cost is an issue in diversion and extinguish orders, but road and rail transport must share a level playing field. The Minister must show that he is aware of public safety matters, about which the Ramblers Association has made its views clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her explanation of the purposes of the amendments. I am sure that the Committee shares a common desire to ensure that the proper framework is put in place. Hon. Members may differ on which parts of the framework are necessary, but I hope that I can assure the hon. Lady and others about the way in which the Government intend to proceed. It is important that costs be kept low, but that will not rule out alternative solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 170 would include in the Bill specific provisions relating to the use made of crossings and the practicability of providing a bridge or tunnel or an alternative path. Those are all matters that clearly would need to be addressed by the council or by the Secretary of State in deciding whether to confirm a rail crossing extinguishment order, and would be covered in administrative guidelines to be published in due course by the Department of the Environment. However, we do not believe that they need to be spelt out in primary legislation, for two reasons. First, questions of need and alternatives are so inextricably bound up with the consideration of whether to extinguish a right of way that it would be impossible for the council or the Secretary of State to reach a decision on the order without taking such matters into account. Secondly, by defining specific issues in that way, the council and the Secretary of State might be constrained from taking into account other matters that might be relevant. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to all the circumstances"</p></blockquote>
enable the council and the Secretary of State to consider every aspect of a proposed closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the principle of amendment No. 11, but it would be wrong to make it a statutory requirement to include with an order a map showing alternative rights of way, because there may not be another right of way that would provide a useful and suitable alternative. However, I agree that, where an alternative highway is available, it should be shown on the map defining the extinguished right of way. That can be dealt with satisfactorily in regulations rather than in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15, like amendment No. 170 in regard to rail crossing extinguishment orders, would introduce a definitive list of issues to be taken into account in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
determining rail crossing diversion orders. That is neither necessary nor, at least in part, desirable. New section 119A, as drafted, allows the council and the Secretary of State to have regard to all the circumstances before confirming a rail crossing diversion order. Those circumstances will embrace the practicability of providing a bridge or tunnel in place of the crossing, the relative convenience of the alternative right of way to be created by the diversion order, and the effect of the diversion on land served by the existing right of way and on land over which the new right of way is formed. There is no need for those to be spelt out in detail in the primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rail crossing diversion orders differ in an important respect from public path diversion orders, in that public safety is the paramount consideration. Therefore, it is not necessarily appropriate to attempt to replicate the provisions in section 119 of the new section 119A. For example, as I said in the discussion on clause 48, it is possible that the public would be prepared to accept a diverted right of way that was less convenient but safe to use if the alternative was closure of the right of way. The concept of public enjoyment of the path or way also seems misplaced if the crossing over the railway line poses a risk to life or limb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful to the Committee if I explain the Government's position on new clause 1, which has some linkage with amendment No. 170. The last part of new clause 1 would amend section 124 of the Transport Act 1968 to enable the Secretary of State to direct the railways board to provide and maintain a bridge or tunnel in place of a footpath or bridleway crossing a railway line on the level. We accept the principle of this part of the proposed new clause 1, and we intend to put forward a suitable amendment on that matter. The inference which may reasonably be drawn from this is that where BR seeks a rail crossing extinguishment order it is turned down on the grounds that the crossing is needed and no suitable alternative right of way exists, the Secretary of State would be able to use that power to direct the railways board to provide a bridge or tunnel, if he were to conclude that there was no other way of making the crossing safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to extend the existing system of level-crossing grant to cover bridges and tunnels in those circumstances. That is an important concession and we shall table amendments to cover those points. The fact that the grant covers 50 per cent. will be welcome, and we shall extend it to cover bridges and tunnels in those circumstances. As I have given the Committee the assurance that we shall table the necessary amendments in due course, I hope that the hon. Lady will not find it necessary to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government's alternative approach to new clause 1, although we shall want to probe it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed at the Government's response to amendments Nos. 170, 11, 15 and 16. They aim to place in the Bill criteria that should be taken into account rather than leave the criteria to administrative guidance. There is not much difference between what we suggest should be included in the Bill and what the Government suggest should be included in administrative guidance, but it would be more helpful to the public to include the criteria in the Bill. Administrative guidance can change, and this
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
part of the legislation might be challenged by groups, such as the Ramblers Association, that are concerned about footpaths. It will be difficult and expensive for them to challenge a footpath closure in the courts, but they probably have the resources to do so. British Rail will also be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who use footpaths are not members of the Ramblers Association. They are ordinary people who do not even walk for enjoyment; they walk as a means of getting to work, to the shops and to go about their daily business. Those people want to see the information as clearly as possible. They want to know what their rights are when they refer to the legislation. The notice will say that, under what will be the Transport and Works Act, a certain path is to be closed. They will want to be able to discover the criteria from reading the Act without having to find out from the Department of Transport what administrative guidance has been given. It should be included in the Bill because the safety of the alternative route is fundamental. If high-speed trains make it unsafe for people to cross a railway line, it is reasonable to ask whether the alternative road will be safe for them to use as cars might come around blind corners on those roads at considerable speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be spelt out to anyone who might want to object to a closure that it is being done in the interests of safety. The objector would then be entitled to argue that the alternative route was no safer, and it might be more dangerous. That should be included in the legislation and not in administrative guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that the clause can be drafted with a broad brush and its application left to administrative guidance is not helpful to the general public, who are not experts, do not understand the way in which Governments work and find it very frustrating to work their way through the bureaucracy. It amazes me that, when I write on behalf of constituents asking Government Departments and others for guidance, it often takes some time for the right document to turn up. In fact, and without wishing to blame anyone in particular, in many cases the right document does not turn up. I have sufficient experience to know that one must persevere and, if necessary, bully to get that document, but many individuals do not have that experience and it causes them considerable frustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the alernative route will not have to be shown because, sometimes, there will not be one. Surely the Minister is not suggesting that some pieces of land will be cut off by the removal of a right of way and that there will be no alternative access. There must always be an alternative route, otherwise some people will be denied access to and from their property. The alternative route might be extremely long and inconvenient, but it is reasonable to require BR to show the alternative way of reaching the land. A judgment can then be made, according to the procedure set out, on whether the extra inconvenience and additional dangers of the new route are outweighed by the safety factors that necessitate the proposed closure. If the Minister wants legislation to be clear so that people can understand it, he should include provisions in the Bill rather than issue administrative guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South referred to the Renton Committee of the House of Lords, which considered the whole legislative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
process and issued the clear guidance that, on the whole, Ministers should include provisions in legislation. I understand that parliamentary draftsmen like to leave things out because it simplifies their task. It is easier to leave things to regulations or administrative guidance because the draftsmen do not have to get the wording right. The excuse for using regulations is that situations vary. If criteria vary so that, for example, fees are increased in line with inflation, or if circumstances are likely to change dramatically, administrative guidance may be required, but something as basic as safety will not change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that provisions for safety could be included in the legislation, as could a requirement to show the alternative route. I do not accept the Minister's argument that there will not be an alternative route; there must be an alternative route. Access to a piece of land cannot be denied as a result of the order. People must have some other way to get to their property, even if it is long and inconvenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will think again and include such a provision in the Bill. If necessary, he should tell the parliamentary draftsmen that, however difficult it is to get right, there is a duty to the general public to ensure that the Bill should spell out the main criteria. I accept that it may still be necessary to have a final catch-all phrase, but the three or four crucial criteria should be included in the Bill. The Minister should consider the members of the public who will have to abide by the legislation and who cannot resort to groups such as the Ramblers Association for legal representation or lobbying expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will want to understand their rights as citizens. The Government have made much of their citizens charter. It is crucial that every citizen can understand the law by reading an Act of Parliament, instead of having to seek guidance as to its interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would be impossible to make a decision without taking account of the factors suggested in amendments Nos. 170 and 15. Amendment No. 170 lists what the Secretary of State would have to take into account when making an extinguishment order, and amendment No. 15 lists his considerations in making a diversion order. The Minister has said that the Secretary of State would have to take all factors into account when making such decisions, so why should not those factors be incorporated in the Bill? The Secretary of State would then be reminded of everything that must be taken into account when making an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that there is an unfortunate tendency to garner all the various powers that exist in various bits and bats of legislation, allowing the Secretary of State to make orders and to leave those powers untrammelled. I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish that the primary legislation should define the factors that the Secretary of State must take into account when making such decisions. That means that civil servants would have to check the factors involved and place a reminder about them before the Minister when he is considering an order. The result is that he would be obliged to take them all into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposition is entirely reasonable. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish that notice of diversion must be publicised if an extinguishment order is made, but acceptance of amendments Nos. 170 and 15 will ensure merely that what the Minister told the Committee earlier will be incorporated in the Bill. What
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
could be simpler? What could be of greater help to the ordinary citizen? People regard Acts of Parliament as the key governors of their rights in such circumstances. As all hon. Members will know, statutory instruments are completely obscure to the general public who, on discovering that the Secretary of State is empowered to make an order, will want to know what factors are to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that few people have any contact with Secretaries of State. They cannot discuss matters with them. This Bill, when enacted, will remain when Secretaries of State have made their decisions and subsequently left Parliament—Conservative Secretaries of State to take up their lucrative boardroom appointments, Labour Secretaries of State to do something more useful for the community, such as working for charities. The Act will be in force and the Secretary of State will be replaced. Time goes on and the continuing documents are the Acts of Parliament. This Act could last for 100 years. When we produce documents that are more than guides—they are requirements—such factors should be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the requirements may be a bit of a disincentive to provide a diversion or an extinguishment order because they are so detailed. He may say that perhaps only two or three could be satisfied before an extinguishment order is made. In case the Minister takes a short circuit in making a decision, it is worth reminding the Committee of the costs of the east coast main line, which we discussed under clause 48 and along which footpaths will have to be diverted. I wish that the Minister could tell us how many rights of way will be considered for diversion or extinguishment orders, but alack and alas, he has not asked British Rail for such information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In exercising his powers under schedule 2, and perhaps accepting some of the intention of the amendments, the Minister should bear in mind that the east coast main line has been much cheaper than the west coast main line. To illustrate the point that the Minister should have a great deal of discretion because of the money that the Government have saved, let me quote from a letter of 15 January 1992 in which the Minister for Public Transport —who was busy going around with boxes of chocolates at the time—wrote to me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I understand from British Rail's archives that, at 1991/92 prices and including new locomotives and rolling stock, electrification of the West Coast Mainline cost in the order of £1900 million. The East Coast Mainline cost about £470 million."</p></blockquote>
Other factors are involved, but if the Minister is worried about the cost of bridges and subways and wants more flexibility to resist the obligations of providing such facilities, he should consider the marked contrast in the cost, which gives him a fair leeway to make up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, along with my hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish and for Stoke-on-Trent, North, I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter because the changes are suitable for what we hope will be enduring legislation. We should not pass powers to the Secretary of State without first defining them in primary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish and for Bradford, South, I had hoped that the Minister would leap to his feet and go into more detail on a matter on which he has so far been unprepared to give a commitment. I listened carefully to him, and we should welcome acceptance of one aspect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
of our amendments and more funds being made available for conversions of level crossings and for bridges and tunnels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister was unable to tell us earlier how many crossings might be affected. In view of his commitment to come back later on this matter, it would be helpful for him to give the Committee some idea of the number of crossings that could be eligible for the new conversion grant, to which he has just referred, and of the order of cost of the 50 per cent. level crossing grant. We hope that BR will make a major investment, especially on the west coast main line. My constituents also hope that BR will make major investments. We want to make sure that a commitment to public safety and adequate crossings is inherent in future investment. However little additional money is made available, it is welcome, but it is not enough to meet all our concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is right. What is the point of going through the Bill and ending up with legislation that does not resolve matters, but simply leaves them to the courts? By not including the amendments in the Bill, the Government will trigger a mechanism that will lead to long and costly disputes in court. Such disputes could easily be resolved in Parliament if the Minister was prepared to disregard that blanket expression—
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to all the circumstances"—</p></blockquote>
and to include the amendments. They spell out what those circumstances might be. We do not want the issue resolved in costly disputes. The Ramblers Association may have the resources to undertake long court proceedings, but many people who walk to and from work may not. Those journeys probably reduce dependence on public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

We are discussing to what extent the Government, when making the orders, will require the promoter to have regard to the cost necessary to have safe public crossings. I am disappointed that the Minister did not give us details of the amount to be included in the enhanced grants for the conversion of level crossings, neither did he give information on the number of crossings on the east coast route for which we pressed him in the stand part debate on clause 48.

Before the Minister intervened, I was about to say that I would withdraw the amendment in the hope that the Government would table their own amendment on Report. I hope that the Minister will give us the earliest possible notice of such an amendment and will give us an idea of the cost of making the new grants to provide safe crossings. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 33, line 45, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'6A. For the purposes of subsections (1) and (4) above, any temporary circumstances preventing or diminishing the use of a path or way by the public shall be disregarded.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 17, in page 35, line 25, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(9A) For the purposes of subsections (1), (4) and (5) above, any temporary circumstances preventing or diminishing the use of a path or way by the public shall be disregarded.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to bring into the proposed new section 118A a provision in the existing section 118 of the Highways Act 1980, which requires any obstruction of a path or hindrance to its use, to be disregarded when considering whether it should be closed. This provision is in section 118, and thus applies to all other orders to close footpaths and bridleways. It means that if there are any circumstances that affect the use of a footpath or bridleway, they have to be disregarded. Such circumstances could be accidental, such as a tree blown down across a path in a gale, or they could be deliberate—a barbed wire fence might be put across a path to try to stop people using it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Rail has already provided an example of why the amendment is necessary. We have already discussed the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill, which proposes to close Tursdale crossing in county Durham. I understand that BR blocked up one side of the crossing to stop people using it and left the obstruction there for a year until Durham county council threatened legal action unless it was removed. If the amendment is not accepted, railway operators and owners and occupiers of land adjoining crossings will have an incentive to obstruct paths and to make their use more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 would perform the same function in regard to the proposed new section 119A. It would discourage railway operators, farmers and landowners with adjoining land from obstructing paths and deterring their use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both amendments are eminently sensible. They would enshrine in the Bill the principles that I have outlined. As they involve no further financial outlay for the Government—we do not want to commit the Minister to even greater expenditure before he has costed his earlier promises—I see no reason for not accepting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, amendment No. 14 would introduce a similar provision into new section 118A. The provision has some practical benefit in section 118—where the main issue is the need for the path or way and it may be right to set aside temporary circumstances affecting its use—but it serves no useful purpose in section 118A. Indeed, it could fetter the Secretary of State's discretion in ways that might produce undesirable decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike section 118, we have provided in section 118A for the council and the Secretary of State to have regard to all the circumstances in deciding whether a rail crossing should be extinguished on safety grounds. We have deliberately not drawn a distinction between permanent and temporary circumstances because, apart from the difficulty of defining "temporary", it may be appropriate in some cases to take into account temporary circumstances. For example, it might be relevant to take account of a temporary increase in the use of a crossing, which resulted in large numbers of the public being put at risk because they were unfamiliar with the crossing. Hon. Members will know that the railway inspectorate is consulting the industry and users about safety standards to apply to particular crossings. One of the criteria relates to the purpose for which people use crossings, since it is agreed that those familiar with an area are less likely to be at risk. Decisions based on normal, rather than temporary flows might be wrong about the level of protection needed at a crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it would be a perverse Secretary of State or council which made decisions on rail crossing extinguishment orders affecting public safety based solely on temporary circumstances. Both the council and the Secretary of State would be bound to take fully into account the use made of a crossing in normal circumstances and, in that context, evidence that current usage was either lower or higher than normal for particular reasons would be relevant to the decision. A balance between safety and convenience has to be struck in all circumstances. We have, therefore, gone for the formulation in the Bill that allows the approving authority to take a comprehensive view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, with those reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed with the Minister's response. When I withdrew my opposition to clause 48, I hoped that he would accept some of the amendments to schedule 2. The Minister should take the opportunity to favour people who wish to use paths. People who are experienced in walking along paths know the methods that landowners often use to put a path into disuse—for example, placing an obstruction across the path. Landowners then claim that they should be allowed to close the path. They often put up notices that state: "Private Land—Keep Off". The land may be private and people are supposed to keep off that land, but they have a right to walk along the footpath. However, such a notice deters people who do not know about that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landowners have for example, a duty to remove any trees that fall across a path, rather than force people to climb over or scramble under them. If a landowner does not remove a tree, it discourages people from using the path. Landowners are sometimes tempted to put a padlock
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
on a gate, thus forcing people to climb over it. After obstructing the path, landowners claim that nobody uses it and ask for it to be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many parts of the country there are active ramblers organisations, whose footpath officers follow the paths and know how to deal with the hazards, although local authorities are often slow to act on complaints and to enforce the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should have said clearly that the Committee would not go along with any attempt by British Rail—or, what is more likely, the private landowners on either side of British Rail crossings—to discourage the use of footpaths and close them by allowing obstructions. The Minister need simply say that he will not allow any suggestion that an obstruction should be taken into account in a closure decision. As long as all the circumstances must be taken into account, it could be argued that an obstruction on a path, which has made it difficult for some people to walk along, should be taken into account at the inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the citizens charter, the Minister should come down in favour of the public's right to walk along a footpath that is not obstructed. It would be simple for the Government to accept the amendment, but it appears that instead of coming down in favour of the citizen's right to walk freely along a public footpath, the Minister will give landowners the impression that if they obstruct a path it may help them in a future argument about its closure. We need a rapid change of heart from the Minister if he wants to convince us that he is trying to meet us part of the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend, I am disappointed at the Minister's lack of response. Opposition Members are always anxious that organisations such as those involving ramblers should avoid having to have recourse to the law to clarify parliamentary legislation that is not drafted carefully enough to make its intentions plain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 is an attempt to insert in proposed new section 119A a provision in the existing section 118 to ensure that any obstruction of path or hindrance to its use will be disregarded when considering whether it should be diverted. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, I find it disappointing that the Minister is so reluctant to accept what we believe to be an eminently sensible amendment. The lack of clarity in the Bill may well allow British Rail or a landowner whose land adjoins a disputed crossing to behave in the way that I outlined in moving amendment No. 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the amendment's clarity and sense, and the lack of either in the Minister's reply, I hope that my hon. Friends will agree that the amendment is well worth supporting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is self-explanatory and the Minister will have some difficulty in opposing the motives that lie behind it. I hope that he will accept it and agree that the Bill should include a provision to restrict the right to apply for a rail crossing extinguishment or diversion order to the operator responsible for maintaining the permanent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it is clear that, unless the amendment is accepted, any operator—of whom there could be many after the privatisation of British Rail—could apply for such orders. It could also be that different operators could apply for different diversions, or that one could apply for a diversion and another for a closure. The Opposition do not for one moment believe that British Rail will be privatised. However, the amendment speaks for itself and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 36, line 10, leave out '9' and insert '6'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can be brief, in anticipation that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond as generously to me as he has just responded to the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposition behind the amendment is simple. the changes to the Highways Act 1980 in schedule 2 would enable the Secretary of State to make a rail crossing extinguishment or diversion order without consulting the local authority if the local authority has failed to make such an order within nine months of receiving a request to do so from the railways operator, or, if the order is opposed, the authority has failed to submit it to the Secretary of State within nine months. Amendment No. 98 would reduce that period from nine months to six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would exert a sensible discipline on the local authority. Six months is a reasonable period for determination of such a matter, and will not be to the detriment of objectors. By definition, there are no objectors to an unopposed order, so local interests will not be harmed by a requirement that the determination be made within six months. However, if the order is opposed, the requirement is simply that the matter should be referred to the Secretary of State within six months. The Secretary of State will then either set up a local inquiry or set the wheels in motion for representations to be heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That means there is nine months from the time that British Rail serves the notice on the local council. It is during that period that the objectors could raise their objections. My amendment would reduce that to six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if the local authority was dilatory—obviously the amendment is designed not to allow that—it could diminish the objectors' time to have notice and to prepare objections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly not my intention to cause that to happen. Whether it be six months, nine months, a year or whatever, I am not sure what obligations there would be on the local authority speedily to notify all interested parties. Equally, it would be unsatisfactory if it sat on the matter for eight months before local objectors were allowed the opportunity to object. I should like to hear more about the disciplines that already apply to local authorities to act expeditiously to ensure that all possible objectors are notified quickly and so utilise the time available. I certainly do not intend to make it harder for objectors. The whole object is to ensure that councils act speedily. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister can give us his response to the proposal before we proceed further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear whether the hon. Gentleman's amendment refers to the period prior to a public inquiry. If it does, that is a pretty short period. In some cases it has been 18 months before a public inquiry is held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present under the Bill, if a local authority has received an objection, but has not referred the proposal to the Secretary of State as it is bound to do, after a total of nine months the Secretary of State takes it over and can order a public inquiry or arrange for representations and the like. It is after that, if it is an opposed matter, that the public inquiry or representation process will start. I am trying to speed up matters when orders are unopposed and, where they are opposed, to speed up the reference to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a case that where public safety is involved, it is vital to ensure that councils deal with applications for rail crossing orders quickly and efficiently. That is why we have introduced a time limit where none exists at present in the Highways Act. In deciding what time limit is appropriate, we have tried to weigh the arguments for speed with the counter arguments that councils must be allowed a reasonable time to consider the application, consult interested parties, make and publish the order and seek to resolve objections to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On further reflection, I agree with my hon. Friend that nine months is too long. Although there is a risk that in setting a six-months time limit more uncompleted cases will have to be referred to the DOE, I believe that responsible councils which treat those cases with the priority they warrant will be able to complete their actions in this period. On the other hand, if councils are minded to be difficult even a nine-months period would be too short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend seeks to get the balance right. The applications will not come out of the blue and will be known about beforehand. Therefore, I am prepared to accept his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear whether there is any danger that the process will lessen the rights of
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
the objector. As I understand it, notices are received by the local authorities, which must then publish them. It is important to allow sufficient time. It would not be satisfactory to put up notices over Christmas, or at other times when people are not around. Can the Minister give us that assurance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->

</div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard much about the rights of local authorities, of objectors and of everybody else. Amendments Nos. 18 and 20 would ensure that the cost of considering the applications and the cost of the rail crossing diversion and extinguishment orders would fall not on the local authorities, but on the railway operators. That is an extension of the polluter pays principle, but from a slightly different perspective. As the schedule stands currently, the cost of making the orders and of arguing the case at a public inquiry will fall on the local authority. It could well be that any objection is ruled out simply on the ground of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the only provision in the Bill for recovery of costs is where a new path is to be created, and that will involve expenditure on works or on compensation to the landowner over whose land the new path will run. Therefore, it is important that the railway operator, not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
the local authority, should meet the costs. Otherwise, we shall have an unequal approach to the way in which the orders are made. People will be denied rights purely on the question of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new section 120A(c) refers to costs and is linked to amendment No. 20, which would require a notice to be placed for a period of 10 years where the crossing used to be. The railway operator would have to meet the cost of ensuring that such a notice is put up and maintained properly at the end of any path that is stopped up by the new orders. It is crucial for notices to be placed at the end of paths or other ways that are diverted or closed by a railway crossing order and to be kept there for 10 years, at the railway operator's expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about safety, which underpins the amendments that we have tabled to schedule 2. We suggest a period of 10 years because the time scale must be linked to maps that people use. It is all well and good to close a crossing and inform people of its closure at the time, but it might take 10 years to show that closure in the ordnance survey maps. It might take 10 years for the "Landranger" and "Pathfinder" maps to include the change, so how will people know about it? How can we ensure that people do not inadvertently use a crossing that has been closed on safety grounds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 will not be very expensive to implement, or even as expensive as the proposals set out in amendment No. 18. The amendments are important for safety reasons and to ensure that people have rights and can challenge the orders. The cost, therefore, should be borne by the railway operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first part of the amendment, I have no difficulty with the principle that local councils should be able to recover their costs in administering a rail crossing order. Indeed, the Department of the Environment is thinking along similar lines and I understand that it intends to introduce new regulations to enable councils to charge fees for administering public path orders. The regulations would be amended to cover rail crossing orders when the Bill was enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a detailed issue. Does the Minister claim that the suggestions included in amendment No. 18 are incorporated in the new regulations that will be issued by the Department of the Environment? Under those new regulations would local authorities be able to charge all their costs, including those of public inquiries, to applicants for orders such as rail crossing diversion and extinguishment orders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we need to see the regulations. I will make further inquiries about the hon. Lady's point. I cannot say yes or no now, because I am not directly responsible for the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already provided in section 119A(7) for councils to require the railway operator to defray full or partial costs of compensation to landowners in connection with a rail crossing diversion order. Provision is also made for the operator to meet the council's costs in preparing the new path or way for public use. Amendment No. 18 has, however, brought to light the fact that councils would be unable to defray their costs arising from a rail crossing extinguishment order. They might, for example, want to erect a new signpost at the point of intersection of the extinguished and other existing paths. We are considering how to meet this point and we shall table amendments, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leaves councils' costs arising from the proposal in amendment No. 20, which would require special types of notices to be placed at the ends of rights of way that are stopped up or diverted under a rail crossing order. Provision is made in the amendments to schedule 6 to the Highways Act, which are contained in paragraph 9 of schedule 2 of the Bill, for rail crossing orders to be subject to the same requirements for the serving and display of notices as public path orders. I can see no compelling reason for treating rail crossing orders differently. We have already provided in section 118A for rights of way to be stopped up to a suitable intersection with another similar right of way so as to avoid dead ends. There is no reason why the alternative route should not be clear to walkers and riders and, if new signposts are needed, that is a statutory responsibility which the local authority could exercise. The amendment to the Bill that I have already promised would enable the council to recover those costs from the railway operator.

Perhaps he could elaborate on the matter in correspondence before Report so that I know the extent to which our suggestions have been accepted and whether they are included in other legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
