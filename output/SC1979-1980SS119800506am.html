	<section>

	<div class='bill'>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [LORDS]</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I apologise for raising this point of order again, but the report of the proceedings last Tuesday, a whole week ago, was presented to us on the table here only this morning. While I appreciate that there are immense problems in terms of industrial disputes with the printers, it makes our job exceedingly difficult when the debate is continuing from last week. I came up to the Committee Room at five minutes to 10, to see whether the report had been laid out here even by then, and it had not been. It means that we cannot study what has been said earlier in the debate. I suggest, Mr. Gourlay, that an adjournment of even half an hour, to allow us to go through what was said last week, would be extremely useful to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point of order. No one feels the absence of the report more than the Chairman. But we are not alone in this dilemma. All the Committees are similarly affected this morning. I am afraid, however, that there is no point in accepting the suggestion for an adjournment, and the Committee should proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I notice that on the selection list this morning there are several additional amendments. We were debating this group last Tuesday, and it appears to have been extended considerably this morning. I should be grateful if the Committee could have an explanation of why the additional amendments have been included in the group. They are clearly Government amendments, and a Government spokesman will no doubt be speaking to them. It seems most unusual to begin a debate with a group of amendments, and then to come back at the following sitting and find that it has been consider-
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
ably extended by the addition of a fairly large number of Government amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but the amendments are all related to the subject under discussion. If the Committee will proceed with the debate, I have no doubt that the Minister concerned will deal with the points at issue, explaining the intention of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The important point must be made that it is to be hoped that this is not a precedent. The debate began against the background of a group of amendments, and we are in the middle of it. As I understand it, only two hon. Members have spoken in the debate so far. Then, lo and behold, they come back to continue the debate, only to find that the scope of it has been considerably widened. It is certainly not the best precedent. If the Government knew that there was something wrong with the Bill, they have had ample time to prepare and table amendments. They ought not to be tabled in the middle of a debate. This is not acceptable practice coming from any Government, and certainly not from the present Government. I hope that this is not a precedent that is being created, Mr. Gourlay, and that it will not continue as we go through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be undesirable, but there is nothing out of order in the practice that has been adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I wonder whether I might ask the Ministers concerned with this Bill, through you, if they are seriously contemplating continuing with the Bill in the light of the very substantial vote of no confidence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—they received from the Scottish people on Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the Chairman is on his feet, an hon. Member must resume his seat. That is not a point of order for this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it not proper, on a point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
of order, to ask whether the Government are seriously intending to proceed with the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not a point of order. It is understood that a Committee proceeds with the discussion of a Bill until it completes its duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I hope this will not be seen as obstructive but it is to give the Government a chance perhaps to clarify future progress. You will remember, that on Second Reading the Government indicated that they were considering their attitude to the reinstatement of the Emslie clause, if I may so describe it, and promised that they would no doubt be letting us know in due course. It might be helpful at this stage if the Government could tell us whether they intend to reintroduce the clause which was defeated in the Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) ought to wait until we reach that stage of the Bill. There is a clause in the Bill which deals with penalties for murder. It would be appropriate if we deal with the matter when we approach that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [
	<i>29 April</i>], No. 28, in page 3, line 1, to leave out the words

	<i>Mr. Donald Stewart.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.35 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>Government amendment Nos. 146 to 148.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong if the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
debate came to a premature close before we had an opportunity to hear from the Government about the new amendments which they have tabled, and from the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) about his important amendments. He is "upping the ante" at every sitting of the Committee. There was a proposal that the extension should be a maximum of 12 hours. I now understand that it has risen over the weekend to 24 hours. If we wait long enough for the Summer Recess the proposed period will probably be as long as the Summer Recess itself. I look forward with interest to hearing the hon. Member on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, there are now close on 30 amendments in the group. It is a real jungle—an impenetrable tangle. It is right that we should have a fairly measured debate in which we try to extract the maximum information, clarification and improvement. Although I am perhaps noted for eternal optimism, I still entertain the faint hope that the Government will be prepared to look in an open-minded way at some of the amendments, and that we may even have the so far unprecedented spectacle in this Committee of a concession or even an approach to a concession—a willingness by Ministers to consider a concession at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three main areas of concern in this group of amendments. I am not suggesting for a moment that it is improper that they should all have been put together. The first one, very properly, concerns when detention starts. The second is the suggestion that has come from the Opposition Benches—and which I know has some at least 
	<i>sotto voce</i> sympathy among Conservative Members that "detention" should be replaced as a term with "temporary arrest". The third main area of debate is the length of the period of detention and the bidding for two to 24 hours which is now before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like briefly to take those three main areas in order and perhaps to make a few preliminary remarks, although, depending on what is said by Ministers at a later stage, no doubt I and other members of the Committee will want to return to the fray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with the definition of "detention" —when it starts. This is a matter of real importance. There is total common ground in the Committee about the need for a definition of when detention begins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
We shall not quarrel about that. The difficulty is how one does it. I have some sympathy with the right hon. Member, because he was trying to be extremely helpful in the last Committee. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), I have had to scramble to find a copy of the proceedings of last Tuesday afternoon. The guidance of the Minister was immensely important in this respect. It is on page GGG2 of the typescript of 
	<i>Hansard.</i> The Solicitor-General told us:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Detention begins from the moment of a person's detention".</p></blockquote>
That does not take us far down the road, although it is not a statement that I should quarrel with greatly. He went on—this is more helpful—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and not from the moment of his arrival at the place in which he is to be detained."</p></blockquote>
He conceded that the Bill was perhaps ambiguous about this, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I want there to be no doubt about that."</p></blockquote>
So the definition that we have is that detention begins from the moment of a person's detention and not from the moment of his arrival at the place in which he is to be detained. That is helpful, because it rules out the possibility of the lengthy journey, the lengthy preliminaries, and so on, not counting towards the ultimate period of six, four or whatever number of hours it may be. I do not for a moment decry that information. It is an important qualification and it is helpful to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is how we know when detention starts. There is no declaration and there are no trigger words or phrases used. Detention starts when it starts, but how do we know when it starts? It is a considerable problem. Other attempts have been made in amendments which have been properly selected in this group, and we are entitled to look at them. For example, the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) has an interesting formulation in which
	<br><blockquote><p>"Detention … shall be deemed to begin from such time as that person is in the presence of a constable who has grounds to, and who is able and willing to, detain him by virtue of that subsection, whether or not that person is aware that he is not free to leave the constable's presence."</p></blockquote>
When I first looked at that formulation I was not terribly taken with it but the right hon. Member for Western Isles may be interested to know that, for reasons to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
which I shall return, I am more and more attracted to it. It has some basic virtues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an effort in our amendment No. 20 to have detention starting from the point where a constable:
	<br><blockquote><p>"indicates to a person that he is required to go to a police station or other premises."</p></blockquote>
That is not academic dancing on the head of a pin. There is a great problem here. There will not always be a situation—in fact it will probably be rare—in which the police constable goes up to someone and says, "I detain you under section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980." What will happen is that someone will be just asked to go to the police station— "invited", as he often is under the present system—and it will not be clear to him whether he is there on a voluntary basis, the "voluntary" being pretty peremptory, or whether the powers under clause 2 are being used. That will give rise to legitimate confusion in the mind of a suspected person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more commonly, if the clause is to have any use, it will be brought into play when someone has been in the police station, clearly on a voluntary basis, for some time and decides that he wants to leave. He may not actually say "I want to leave", but at some point that voluntary stay in the police station may be transubstantiated—if I may use an unlikely religious term—into the powers under clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be assuming that there will be a statement by the police constable to the effect that that is happening. I should be much happier if that were specifically built into the Bill, so that we knew that there could not be the six hours running and there could not be compulsory detention unless the police constable concerned made a clear, unequivocal statement to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that that is implied and that if we say that detention starts when detention starts, clearly we must tell the man that detention is starting. But that is not necessarily true. There will be all sorts of grey areas where it is not clear whether it is voluntary or compulsory, and I should be very much happier if there were some trigger provision. There was an attempt to do this in the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and myself, because these referred to the situation where the constable indicates that a person is required to go.
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
If the constable was not indicating a requirement, then clearly the detention would not have started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to see—and, of course, the Minister will remember this—that the Law Society in its memorandum makes very much the same point, and calls for an end to what it calls the "invitation". The Committee will find this on page 7, where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If clause 2 is enacted it should also be enacted that the practice whereby the police 'invite' persons to attend at a police station should cease, although the Council recognises that some persons will choose to attend at a police station genuinely of their own volition."</p></blockquote>
That is an extremely interesting comment from the Law Society. It is redolent with inferences, because it is an acceptance by this staid and respectable body that, while occasionally people may go genuinely of their own volition, most invitations do not imply genuinely voluntary attendance. That seems to me to be an extremely interesting statement, coming from such a source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attraction of the formulation of the right hon. Member for Western Isles is that it would preclude the invitation in terms referred to by the Law Society. If we say that the detention starts from a point where the person is in the presence of a constable who has formed a suspicion— whether or not that person is aware of the fact that he is not free to leave the constable's presence—at that stage it means, in effect, that all invitations in these terms become powers under clause 2 and are therefore limited to six hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me like an extremely attractive proposition, because it would shift the onus of proof. It would mean that at the end of six hours the person would have to be released because the six hours could not be reinforced. At that point he could only stay if he made an absolutely positive declaration that he wanted to stay and that he intended to stay in the police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will not think I am delaying matters by raising these points. I hope that we can look at whether there is not some virtue in what the right hon. Member for Western Isles has said in the terms I have just outlined, that is, that all questioning in the police station should be limited to six hours unless there was a positive decision—not a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
negative staying on by default because a person does not know his rights, but a positive decision to stay—on the part of the suspected person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point to which I should like the Minister to address his mind is whether it is sufficient to say that detention starts when it starts, or whether we should not write in what may be implied and inferred, but about which I think there should be a specific declaration in some form of words laid down in statute, to start off the detention process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another reason—which I should just like to mention briefly—why I do not want amendment No. 20, in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and myself, to be forgotten. Not only does it attempt to formulate when detention starts; it also writes in a couple of extremely important safeguards, on which I think the Minister has a duty to comment, and which I should hope the Committee would consider seriously— dividing on them if they do not find favour with the Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of these is that after the six hours or four hours has elapsed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the constable must inform him"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the suspect—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that he cannot be compelled to stay at the place where he has been detained for a further period unless he wishes to do so or he is arrested and charged."</p></blockquote>
That seems to me to be an important consideration. We know that in theory— and, I hope, in practice—a person cannot be held for another six hours against his will, but in a situation where someone may have drifted into compulsory detention, where there is no opening declaration, at the end of the six hours, or four hours or whatever, I can envisage a situation where the police may say to themselves— "At this point we are not holding him compulsorily, but the poor beggar does not know that he has the right to leave, therefore we will allow him to sit there and go on questioning him on a 'voluntary' basis." The very proper safeguard, which was written in in the Lords, stopped the extraordinary suggestion that the six hours could be renewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This suggestion was rightly condemned by the Under-Secretary of State in the Committee dealing with the previous Labour Government's Bill. He referred to it in terms of South African racial
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
legislation, as he will recall. I find it extraordinary, in view of that very sterling attack, that it should have reappeared in the drafting of his Bill until we were rescued by the House of Lords. As we have been rescued by the other place, Mr. Gourlay, it is doubly important that we have the amendment No. 20 safeguard that at the end of the period there should be a specific duty on the police to say to the suspected person "You have tholed your six hours or your four hours. Now you can stay on, if you wish, on a voluntary basis, but there is no way in which we can tell you to do so, and you may leave if you want." Then, if a man stays on, we know that he has stayed on voluntarily. That seems to me to be an important safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other important safeguard in amendment No. 20 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When a constable exercises the power conferred by subsection 1 above he shall as soon as is practicable report the circumstances of the person's detention to the officer in charge for the time being at the police station or other premises where the person is detained and the said officer in charge shall decide if the detention is justified".</p></blockquote>
I hardly need to labour the importance of that point. It is one which seems to me to be self-evidently sensible. If someone is taken to a police station, the officer in charge, the senior man there, should be consulted and should satisfy himself that 
	<i>prima facie</i> there is a need, in terms of the investigations, for that person to be detained. Without wanting to go back to all the good books and all the texts, let me just remind the Committee that this is a specific recommendation from the Thomson committee report, to be found in para 322. I quote briefly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On arrival at at a police station the detainee's position should be considered by the officer in charge for the time being at the station. It should be for him to decide whether to authorise the detainee's continued detention. He should do so only where such detention is in his view justified."</p></blockquote>
It continues at the foot of the paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We so recommend."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that they have recommended in vain, because that is not in the Bill. The Law Society for Scotland again picks up this point on page 6, paragraph 3.13:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"It is essential"—in the somewhat perjink world of legal terminology, "It is essential" is quite strong language. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is essential that the officer in charge of the police station should authorise the detention".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
This is a comparatively simple amendment. It does not strike at the Conservative philosophy on penal matters, it does not strike at the heart of the Bill, but it is an important safeguard. It is part of the Thomson package. It is recommended by the Law Society. It appears in amendment No. 20. I hope the Government will be prepared to look at this extremely carefully and give us some good reason why they should not accept it. Perhaps they could redraft it; perhaps they could promise to bring it back on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second general area, with which I can deal much more briefly, is found in amendment No. 44 and consequential amendments, which is to take out "detention" and put in the words "temporary arrest". I was discussing this with a colleague on the Committee the other day and he said that he had a good deal of sympathy with it, but he was worried that it was merely cosmetic. He suggested that it was in the same stable as the change from "malicious damage" to "vandalism", that it does not really change anything and is merely a piece of rather unpleasant window-dressing. I was impressed by that point, and I wondered if I had been guilty of a Conservative sin. I think not, because there is real value and real merit in the change advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in a sense to underline the inadequacies of the safeguards in the Bill, particularly since amendment No. 12 was rejected by the Solicitor-General at a previous hearing. You will recall, Mr. Gourlay, that amendment No. 12 was to put in a statutory caution of a much more satisfactory nature than the rather vestigial recommendations that are presently in the Bill. The reason why I wish to draw attention to that and ask the Government to look again at the matter is that if we do not have "detention" but "temporary arrest", the word "arrest" means that people ought to have certain safeguards which apply to an arrested person, which do not apply to others. If we have "temporary arrest" rather than "detention" it would be a sterling invitation to the Ministers to go back to look at amendment No. 12 or some other form of words, to see whether it would not be right to build in those proper safeguards the rights of an arrested person, which would include, of course, a caution. It is in that spirit that I press amendment No.
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
44 and the consequentials. It might draw people's attention to the difficult situation in which a suspected person can be placed, and to the need for proper safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final area with which I said I would deal is this dutch auction of four hours, six hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and ever onwards escalating into time infinite and interminable. There is no hard and fast rule here. I accept that it is a matter of judgment. Thomson comes down on the side of the Government, and I immediately concede that. In paragraph 3.25, which has been much quoted, we find a passing reference to the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties and an argument that six hours would be appropriate. The Scottish Council for Civil Liberties objected basically to the whole concept, but said that if the evil thing was to be done, six hours was possibly not an unreasonable figure. The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is smiling, because he was one of those who so eloquently argued that the detention principle should not be in the Bill or in legislation at all in his days as a member of the executive of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, I accept that Thomson comes down in favour of six hours. But that in itself is not decisive, and perhaps I may read from the same paragraph the following sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We stress that this is the maximum period of detention and that we expect that in the vast majority of cases the actual detention will be for a shorter period."</p></blockquote>
In these circumstances it is not unreasonable, even in terms of Thomson, to suggest that four hours would be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Under-Secretary of State is right about this, but none of us is infallible and I shall have to check with Thomson to get the timing on that.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
Thomson certainly said six hours, but made the point that in the vast majority of cases this would not be needed. It seems to me that it is perhaps better to legislate for the vast majority of cases rather than for the exceptional case, and it is on that basis that I would prefer the four-hour provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a range, not only on the overkill side represented by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), but also in the other direction. As the right hon. Member for Western Isles will doubtless remember, his colleague, the right hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) moved amendments to the last Bill to reduce it to two hours and pressed that to a Division. Therefore, the Scottish nationalists' view, on the last Committee at least, was that it should be two hours and not four hours. It was unusual, because his was the only vote that was cast on that Division and he must therefore have felt very strongly about the matter. I imagine that in these circumstances the right hon. Member would feel that four hours was perhaps not entirely satisfactory but would be preferable to six hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be some reluctance to accept the point that I made in my intervention. I refer the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends to paragraph 3.27 of the Thomson committee report, where it says in a summary of the recommendations:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person shall be detained in a police station without being arrested and charged, beyond the time at which the police, in the light of information available to them, ought to have charged or released him, and in any event for longer than six hours."</p></blockquote>
There is a similar reference in the longer version of the recommendations. It is quite clear that Thomson was recommending six hours from the moment the suspect arrives in the police station or other premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I accept the point that the Minister is making, Mr Gourlay, but paragraph 3.18 of the Thomson report says:

	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>

I accept that the wording of that may be a little ambiguous, but it would appear to me to cover the point that my hon. Friend is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be a little like the interpretation of the Dead Sea scrolls. Textual criticism may be taken too far. We seem to be going back to the kind of scholarship which is devoted to the first folios of the works of William Shakespeare. I do not think it really matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept that there is at least an arguable case to interpret Thomson either way as to whether there is included a preliminary period before arrival at the police station in that six-hour period. We have had a number of suggestions, ranging from two hours to 24 hours. We all have to use our subjective judgment, there is no objective test which can be applied. For what it is worth, my judgment is that, when one looks at fairness and equity to the police, if one is to give them the power, they must have some opportunity to exercise it. I do not want them to have the power but I accept that, if it is in the statute, the statute must make proper provisions for the exercise of that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one also looks at fairness and equity in terms of the suspect, it seems to me that four hours is preferable to six hours. After all, if people are genuinely wishing to help the police with their inquiries, they can stay on for as many hours as they wish. We are talking here about compulsion and the time when there is not sufficient evidence for an arrest. It is right to err on the conservative side—conservative with a small "c"—of the argument and go for four rather than six. This is something about which everyone will have to make up his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there are a lot of important amendments buried, if I may say so, in this rather formidable thicket. I hope that we shall be able to separate them out and that we shall be able to vote on a number of them as we progress. The safeguards in amendment No. 20, which require the police to tell a suspected person that he may now depart if he wishes at the end of the period of detention, and the scrutiny
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
of senior police officers, seem to me to be matters of real importance. I hope that these, along with a specific declaration to a person to start the period running, are things on which the Minister will give us a full reply in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the subject with which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was dealing, while I appreciate the difficulties that he mentioned in trying to argue for one particular limit of time, I feel that the argument is of necessity somewhat academic. The Committee is in danger of losing sight of the purpose of detention. It appears to me that the idea of setting a limit on detention is not to set a period of detention which will apply in every case but to set a maximum limit on the time that somebody can be detained in a police station. Presumably, the reason why he is being detained is in order to assist police with their inquiries, either to reach a stage where he will have to be released because they do not have the evidence required to arrest him, or to reach a situation where they have sufficient information to arrest and charge him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, what we are doing here is trying to give the police a sufficient maximum period, not for every case—if there are other cases which can be dealt with in two or three or four hours, the police will anyway have a duty to release or arrest a person at the time that their inquiries have reached that stage—but to make sure that the maximum is long enough to give the police a chance to obtain the information for which they are looking. As against that, one has to balance the rights of the individual person and to ask oneself how long someone should be allowed to be held in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) mentioned the case of Hartley earlier in the Committee proceedings, where a few years ago there was a 
	<i>de facto</i> detention. I am sure that he would agree that what was happening in that case was a form of detention where there was a period of 12 hours before the information which the police required was obtained. My own feeling is that that is too long. A 12-hour period is too much to ask of anybody. Therefore I do not support the amendment put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). I equally feel, however, that there are cases where four hours will not be sufficient for the police to be able to achieve either the information to release the person or the information to arrest him. We must look at this, as I said, not as a general rule, for, in the words of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden, it should not operate as a general rule anyway. There will be cases where the police will not need the time which the statute will give them, but we are looking at a maximum. If we look at it as a maximum, then that maximum of about six hours seems to be about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point I wished to mention in this brief intervention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On what basis does the hon. Gentleman feel that the maximum of six hours is "about right"? Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that he is in the same boat as Thomson? Thomson does not give any arguments in favour of six hours. The cases presented to Thomson were in favour of 12 hours and 24 hours. In many ways I strongly disagree with his hon. Friend, but his hon. Friend is on much firmer ground than the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), when it comes to an argument to be supported by Thomson. Thomson does not give any reasons for six hours, and I wonder why the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South thinks that six hours is about right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded that Thomson, at paragraph 3.25 states that the six hours was the minimum period favoured by the police witnesses, so that they evidently feel that this is a time which suits the requirements of what they have to achieve during detention. I accept, to a certain extent, what the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has said—that it might be possible taking the logic of the situation, to say that the police must be assisted to decide whether a person has or has not committed a crime, and that there should perhaps be no limit. I find that position untenable. Equally, I find a period of over six hours—the basic standard test in the law of Scotland—unfair. I accept the evidence given to Thomson by the police witnesses—that the period of six hours is about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the other question,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
which was raised originally by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth, namely, his amendment to remove the word "detention" and replace it with the words "temporary arrest". I have a certain sympathy with what he is trying to do, because I find that the word "detention" has connotations which are unfortunate in the context of what is being done by the Bill. I am not happy, however, with the words which he has chosen to replace it, since they too have a certain connotation in Scottish law, in that arrest is always accompanied by a charge at the time. There would be a great danger, if the hon. Member's amendment were to be accepted, that in order to clear up one ambiguity or one unfortunate connotation, we might be creating a situation with another ambiguity or another unfortunate connotation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept that the word "detention" is not satisfactory, that it has unfortunate connotations, and that some of us would like to hear from the Government that they will undertake to think again about this term, and will take advice as to whether there is another appropriate term, perhaps dug up from the depths of the criminal law of Scotland in the past, which will give expression to what the Bill is trying to do, without creating the unfortunate connotation which attaches to the word "detention".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments tabled by the Opposition in this group and on the rest of the clause in no way give support to the general provision of detention. What we are attenpting to do in the amendments is at least to introduce safeguards to the person who is detained under the clause. I must state at the beginning that I am opposed to the principle of detention, and hope to debate that when we come to the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is opposed to the principle of detention, what is his solution? He surely agrees that the police must question people. What solution has he as an alternative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the principle of detention has already been decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
exactly that point, Mr. Gourlay, but I was sure that you would rule me out of order if I attempted to answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four basic issues involved in this group of amendments, not three, as was suggested at the beginning. One is the time at which detention starts. There seems to be agreement in the Committee, from the amendments which have been put down, that it should start at the point at which the constable says "You are being detained". That is perfectly valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make only one point on this—the point that I made to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). Guidelines issued by the Secretary of State on how this should be carried out should be the subject of democratic scrutiny through this House and the other place. In other words, the guidelines should be put down in the form of an order before the House before they are finally issued to the chief constables. I know that my hon. Friends agree with me on that. Running throughout the Bill there has to be provision for democratic scrutiny of it. I hope that the Government will consider that. If not, I give notice that I shall try to put down an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the phrase "temporary arrest", the terminology may well be, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) has pointed out, partly cosmetic. But I think that he agreed with the general principle. We sought in the amendment to give terminology which would give the person being detained more rights than the Bill provides. I hope that the Government will consider the phraseology very seriously. The term "detention" has overtones of South African and other totalitarian States. It is an emotive word and its use is unfortunate in relation to the law of Scotland. I shall be honest. We all try to think of other words that could be used. I noticed that although the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South asked his hon. Friends to produce other words, he was unable to do so. "Temporary arrest" was the only phrase that we could see and, while there may be some problems with it, it seems the most satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave the matter of the length of time. That is quite clear. The previous Labour Government's Bill suggested four hours. That seems perfectly reasonable. I do not want to go into the semantics of the Thomson report again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, I want to deal with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
amendment No. 20, in the names of my hon. Friends, which makes the officer in charge responsible for saying that detention has started. That is an important safeguard. If only the constable is allowed to do it, the procedure is open to abuse. One of our worries throughout the clause is the way in which it can be abused by a small minority of the police. The large bulk of the police will not abuse this power, but a small minority will. In a police station of 20 or 30 constables, two or three who are prepared to abuse that power will create an unfortunate atmosphere for community-police relations in the whole area, even if the other 27 or 28 policemen work within the law and work correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment at least allows us to ensure that if the officer in charge considers that one of his own constables has been operating outside the strict terms of the law in relation to detention, he can say "No I am sorry. Detention will not take place in this case. The man will be released." That is a valid safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friends to accept my amendment to their amendment because it is clearer, and nearer to what the Thomson report said. My amendment to their amendment states that it should be done, not as soon as is practicable on arrival at the police station, but immediately on arrival at the police station. The Thomson report said in paragraph 3.22:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On arrival at a police station the detainee's position should be considered by the officer in charge for the time being of the station."</p></blockquote>
There is no equivocation about it in terms of when it is practicable; It is clearcut. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On arrival at a police station."</p></blockquote>
That is what my own amendment to my hon. Friends' amendment is saying. I hope that they will accept it and allow it to become part of their own. I accept the principle of what they are trying to say, but it seems to me that one cannot leave it to the individual constable's discretion as to whether he considers it practicable to consult with the officer in charge. It is something which has to be done immediately on arrival at the police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Ministers will consider this seriously. It is part of the Thomson report. It is something which ought to be inbuilt. At this stage I shall leave my
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
remarks on these amendments, and I hope that the Government will consider them seriously. They are meant to safeguard the rights of the detainee and improve, in my view, the actual working of the clause. The whole clause is damaging to police and community relations, but the amendments make it more likely that those relationships will not be damaged as greatly as they would be if the clause went through as it stands at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 27 and 137 which are in my name. I take a position with which Opposition Members do not agree, and I hope that they will listen carefully to my points. First, I understand that the official view of the Opposition is that they accept the principle of detention. I presume this because the Lord Advocate in the previous Government said that clause 2
	<br><blockquote><p>"is designed to further police inquiries, so that justice may be done, so that the innocent may be released and those who may be guilty can be further investigated."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1979, c. 152.]</p></blockquote>
I take it from that that they accept the principle of detenton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can take nothing from that but that the previous Lord Advocate accepted it and that the previous Government accepted it. It is not the case that either the Labour Party or all the Labour Back Benchers accepted the principle. But surely this in any case relates to clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention because it clarifies the position, and that is exactly what I hoped to do. I wished to clarify the position of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw attention to the Thomson report, which recommended that the practice of inviting persons to the police station should be regularised. I would have thought that no one would argue with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to draw attention to the question of the period of detention. Paragraph 3.25 of the Thomson report says that six hours was recommended. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This was the minimum period favoured by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
the police witnesses who considered that generally it would be adequate for their purposes."</p></blockquote>
So the police obviously felt at that time that six hours would be adequate for their purposes, but there were members of the Thomson committee who favoured 24 hours and 12 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw attention to the fact that those who support the principle would wish that detention, when it is used by the police, would be seen to be both fair and effective; that the police, when using these new powers, would produce results which would justify their use. In my judgment, unless there are results, the police would be very unwise to use such powers. They can only maintain their working relationship with the public if the public believe that the powers so given are being used wisely and sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like at this time to draw attention to pages 1 and 2 of today's 
	<i>Daily Telegraph.</i> A page 1 headline is "SAS storm embassy". Another reads: "8 months jail for holiday hooligan". Page 2 has the headline:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Heads seek tougher law on vandalism".</p></blockquote>
The next is "Strike by 250 teachers". Then we have:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Social problems may change police training".</p></blockquote>
Another reads: "Barrister rules revised". The next reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Print union plans to step up Fleet Street 'guerrilla' action".</p></blockquote>
We also have:
	<br><blockquote><p>"ILEA warns of Nazi activists in schools",</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"Closed shop ruling may be sought".</p></blockquote>
That is today's 
	<i>Daily Telegraph.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like also to refer to page 5 of 
	<i>The Observer,</i> where one of the headlines is: "Children's 'sin bins'". I draw attention to these headings because I suggest that no one can deny that we live in a world where the police have to work in extremely difficult and often very dangerous circumstances. Surely the events of yesterday should convince everyone that this is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, if Parliament is to give the police new powers, these powers must be accepted by the public and the police as making a positive contribution to maintaining law and order. What is more, they must be seen to be assisting in
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
bringing law breakers to trial. I believe that there are many instances where the period of detention, to be effective, must be longer than six hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also believe that a shorter period of detention is more likely to encourage abuse, because a constable would not wish to be away from his beat or patrol for a long period unless he was fairly confident that he could bring a charge after questioning. I think this is most important. Any constable who made a practice of detaining suspects and who failed to bring charges would not be too popular with his superiors. Indeed, I go further: he would more than likely be rebuked for being away from his beat or patrol. The shorter the period of detention, the more likely that is to be open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw attention to the situation in Scotland. There were 10,000 cases of child abuse reported to the Royal Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children last year. About 400 of these were cases of baby battering. In addition, in every year there are many cases of murder or homicide within the family environs. This type of case is exactly what I have in mind when I recommend that detention should be longer rather than shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, parents and relatives suspected of violence have been invited to help the police with their inquiries. Thomson recommended that we should regularise this practice. When this Bill becomes an Act, the police will be expected to detain suspects. Six hours in cases involving the domestic environs—a situation affecting parents, relatives and so on—is not long enough for questioning. We should look at this very seriously because this is a serious, not a frivolous, amendment. I am deeply concerned that the relations of the police with the public should be maintained at a high level. We should so word it, when presenting this, that the police would consider it wrong to abuse these powers. Any policeman who abuses his power should have the full wrath of the law brought on him. That is the most ghastly thing that could happen. If we shorten the period of detention, as has been suggested, we encourage those who are likely to bend the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, Mr. Gourlay. If the Committee waits to hear what I have to say, it may well see that I have some proposals to put forward which I hope will be helpful in bringing that about. I am speaking to my amendment. I would like the Committee to recognise that when this Bill becomes an Act the police will be expected to detain suspects in cases where they hope to bring a conviction. We in the Committee should recognise that the type of case that is most likely to bring police charges after questioning is the type of case to which I have been drawing attention. I am not a lawyer but I have spent some time recently reading cases involving child abuse, and more often than not, after police questioning, a charge is made. I draw that to the attention of hon. Members. I believe that 12 hours is the minimum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why he picks out domestic matters and baby battering as the cases where a minimum of 12 hours is necessary above all other cases? I cannot follow his reasoning or his experience on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to explain in a way that will be understood, I hope. If someone is picked up in the High Street for loitering with intent outside a shop, the chances of getting that individual—in my judgment and this is borne out by police reports—to accept after questioning that he was loitering with the intention of breaking in, are remote. But if the police question a parent who has abused his child—for whatever reason, usually in a fit of anger or as a result of drink—it would usually take longer than the six hours to obtain an admission of responsibility. That is why I think 12 hours is the minimum likely to produce positive results, and is likely to be less open to abuse than shorter periods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am curious as to what the hon. Member imagines will happen during this 12-hour or 24-hour period. As I understand it, there is a right to silence. No statement need be made. Presumably he would accept that the test applied by the courts will always be one of fairness.
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
One could not have repeated pressure through questioning. If someone does not make an admission, a self-incriminating statement, or any useful statement in six hours, it is very unlikely that he will make them in 12 hours, short of starvation or continued pressure, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman would not wish to condone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always believed that the period of questioning is important. I relate this to my experiences in interviewing and personnel work, where one carries out interviews in depth. The longer someone is exposed to repeated questioning on the same theme, the more likely it is, in my experience, that a statement will be obtained. I have no experience of this type of criminal investigation but I have some experience in the field of eliciting truth, which is what I believe the clause intended to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 137 I ask the Committee to look at the benefits which could be obtained from the 24-hours detention. If 24 hours were accepted as the maximum, and if this were linked to the compulsory use of videotape equipment, I believe that this would remove the risk of abuse and also the practice of bringing unsubstantiated charges of police abuse. This is one of the problems we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a genuine proposal. I think that every member of this Committee would like to see wrongdoers brought to trial, would like to see the innocent protected, and would like to give the police the tools to do their job. I put forward my amendments in a serious and sensible attempt to widen the discussion in this extremely important debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I ought to deal briefly with what the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said. I was listening to him very carefully, as were my colleagues, and his speech seemed to me to be a series of non-sequiturs. His conclusion did not follow in any way from the argument he was putting forward. Even the revelation towards the last few seconds of his speech about the fact that we should have a 24-hour videotape of the detention, did not seem to explain what he was doing. The instances of child abuse and domestic violence of which he spoke are precisely the cases in which, even if one accepted the principle of detention, that length of time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
would not be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing that the speech of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire seemed to prove was that he has just had a long weekend and has been able to read the Sunday, Monday and Tuesday papers during the course of it. I am afraid that even his extensive quotations from the papers did not seem to prove anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, notwithstanding what a layman has said, and notwithstanding the brilliant exposition by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), in which he dissected the plethora of amendments and distilled them into three excellent summary headings for the debate, over the last few sittings I have come to the clear inescapable conclusion that there are far too many lawyers in the Committee —far too many advocates, far too many solicitors and far too many barrack-room lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose never to quote from the Thomson report. I propose never to quote all the cases of X v. Y. I propose that what we should do—you, Mr. Gourlay, are the kind of person who appreciates this above everything else—is to apply our practical experience of the world—what no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden would describe as common sense—to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to do that with regard to the third point that my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden raised—the length of the period, with which the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire has been dealing. I presume that if there were clear and unequivocal evidence against a suspected person, the police would carry out the normal process of arrest, which is the power that they have at the moment. Even with that power, people are arrested who, subsequently, through the normal processes of the court, are clearly proved to be innocent. Some are found guilty and subsequently proved innocent. Notwithstanding that policemen, make arrests under their present powers with the best will in the world, a substantial number of those arrested are subsequently proved through the courts to be innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power that is proposed, which I shall call, for the purpose of argument, detention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
Nobody is proved innocent. People are innocent and remain innocent until they are proved to be guilty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that helpful intervention by the Solicitor-General. It is a helpful intervention which I shall use in a moment. People are innocent until proved guilty. But, even if there is enough evidence to bring the case before the court, under the present arrangement many people have their innocence upheld by the processes of law. One presumes that the proposed new power of detention will apply where there is no clear fact which can be brought by the police to justify the arrest. Therefore one would suspect that many more of those who would be detained under these powers would be likely subsequently to have their innocence upheld—not to be proved innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say, therefore, to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire that in deciding the balance, if one accepts that there is to be detention—like my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) I am not happy about the principle—we have to see on the one hand the need for the police to be able to get the information that they require, and on the other, the protection of people, many of whom will subsequently be seen to be innocent, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) said. Therefore, in considering the period, we have to think about practical questions not about legal questions and niceties, but about practical questions. These are innocent people who, perhaps because of mistaken identity, will be picked up and taken into detention. With 24 hours board and lodging will have to be provided, the people will have to be fed, and it means that they are away from their houses overnight. Even 12 hours or six hours of detention causes great inconvenience. Most people, during the period of six hours, will have a meal. Therefore, one would presume, if people are to be detained for six hours, meals will have to be provided, unless the intention behind this provision is that people should be starved into submission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made a splendid case for increasing the period of detention. These are all reasons why the police would not abuse it, and that is exactly the point that I was making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to deal with that point in a moment, as satisfactorily as the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) dealt with his interventions. The practicality of the situation is that in many police stations there are no facilities to provide either accommodation or meals, so that unless we expect people to be starved into making some kind of statement, six hours is also an unpractical time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrest and detention for six hours have an effect on people's work. If they are on their way to work it can create tremendous problems for someone's prospects. No doubt that would apply to housewives when innocent women are detained. This period would have an effect on their family commitments, on dealing with their, children at school, or on all their activities within the home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about a maximum period of detention, and not a general period applicable in every case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The experience of many people is that the maximum becomes the norm. The police will get into their heads that they have six hours, or four hours, in which to carry out this activity, and that will become the norm. Whatever period is eventually decided by this Committee and by Parliament will become the norm, and many people will be affected in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given some practical, down-to-earth examples of housewives, workers or other people who will be inconvenienced, of the kind of facilities which do not exist in police stations which would make it difficult for this procedure to be carried out, although it seems in the first instance to be an unfair procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the semantic point, the second point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden. I always find it interesting to discuss words. It is interesting to see when people, in this House and elsewhere, say, "I will detain you for only a few moments longer", and then go on for hours, how the English language is abused. At first I was attracted to the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, of "temporary arrest", except that on my understanding the implication of that would be that the other form might be considered as permanent arrest. That would have a strange connotation. "Detain", does not, I agree, explain
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
exactly what is meant by the suggestion in the Bill. While that is not satisfactory, neither is "temporary arrest". I come down to the view of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). He was mistaken for me at the last sitting. I have agreed with him on two occasions and that might explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might find yet another new word. One might look at our history to find some old Scots word. In what I consider a barbaric proposal, we are going back in history. It occurred to me in a more poetic moment that in the past we have used the names of people to define words. They become incorporated into the language like "boycotted". I thought of Thomson and Fairbairn. As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, the name Rifkind lends itself most appropriately to this. "My goodness, I've been 'rifkinned'" seems appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are whispered suggestions of hon. Members on the Government side that my own name might be appropriate, but I must say that that would bring in other connotations which might be inappropriate in the context of a Scottish Bill. Having rejected that, I think "rifkinned" is the appropriate word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have not been too lighthearted about this matter because it is a matter of great seriousness. I am concerned not just with the semantics to find an appropriate word to deal with this, but with the principle, which is much more important and, in the context of the current series of amendments, with the time involved. I think that the suggestion of six hours raises some practical difficulties and raises a lot of problems for individuals. That should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that the Ministers are pursuing the Bill with such alacrity when it is clear that they no longer, even if they ever did—and I would suggest that the general election showed that they did not—have the confidence of the people of Scotland in putting forward this kind of proposal. If there was ever any doubt about it, last Thursday would have shown even more clearly that they do not have the confidence of the people of Scotland for any of their proposals. Indeed, even the Secretary of State, if he were to stand in an election tomorrow in his own constituency, if the figures of last Thursday were to be repeated in a general election, would no longer be the right hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal briefly with two points which have been raised in this set of amendments. The first relates to that period of six hours which is in the Bill. There has been considerable discussion and contemplation of the reasons why six hours is fixed upon as the appropriate period. It seems to me that it is perfectly obvious: the Thomson committee unanimously reached the view that six hours was appropriate. I think it should be spelt out that the various views on the maximum permissible period were not differences of opinion among the members of the committee, but among the witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The variations as between 24 hours, 12 hours and so on came from the witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One should have very careful regard to the membreship of that committee. It sat under the late Lord Thomson and there cannot have been a more robust spokesman and defender of the Scottish legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sitting on the committee was a solicitor from Glasgow of the greatest reputation. I predict that if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) ever has to go back to earn his bread in this way he will not get a newspaper column or his autobiography serialised in the 
	<i>Sunday Mail</i> "Send for Dowdall."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But apart from that doughty defender of the innocent and
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
accused in Glasgow, the committee had within it Lord Dunpark, who owed his membership not to his present position as Senator of the College of Justice, but to the fact that he was at that time a prominent member of the Scottish Law Commission. Following him was Professor Gerald Gordon, and as anyone who knows anything about the criminal law in Scotland, knows he is the author of the present important work on the law of Scotland "The Criminal Law of Scotland", supported by the Scottish Law Institute. Furthermore, he is now the editor of the only prominent book on criminal procedure in Scotland "Renton and Brown". Another member was the Hon. Lord Stewart, who had been a Solicitor-General within the Labour Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the hon. Member just proved my point by reading out this list of of lawyers? There were no ordinary people on that committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest of respect, there were. There were people such as Professor Spencer and Dr. Balfour Sclare. Some very eminent people were involved in it, and it is not surprising that the Government should fix upon the period of six hours, rather than the four hours which the last Government used in an attempt to allay in some way the concern of Members such as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) when the principle of detention was introduced. It was an awkward compromise by the previous Government, and there is good reason, given the Thomson report, to stick to the six hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now refer briefly to the amendments which propose that the term "temporary arrest" should be introduced. During the Second Reading I indicated that I considered it most unfortunate that the Thomson committee had not stuck to that terminology. Whilst I, like hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, should like to find some term which has a less pejorative sense than "detention", but there is one thing I should like to avoid. There has been in Scotland a considerable controversy about clause 2. If there is to be any change in terminology I would have some anxiety if it were purely a cosmetic one. I think that the Government have to stick to their guns on this matter. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
sticking to his guns, having introduced the principle of detention in a Labour Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances I should have preferred this power to be described as "temporary arrest" from the start, but I have some misgiving that if we were immediately to change the terminology to "temporary arrest" we should be accused from both sides of the Committee of carrying out a cosmetic exercise to avoid facing up to the introduction of a power which is undoubtedly unpopular in certain quarters in Scotland. We have that power. I think we should stick to it, but at the same time I should not like it to be thought that either the Government or any members of this Committee were in one way or another avoiding facing up to what is being introduced. It was unfortunate that Thomson in the very first set of written questions that it put out to interested parties in Scotland should have asked
	<br><blockquote><p>"Should there be a power of temporary arrest?"</p></blockquote>
That it should have asked witnesses questions in oral evidence on the basis of a power of temporary arrest and that it was only when its second report came out that it should have changed the terminology from "temporary arrest" to "detention".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. and learned Friend, the Solicitor-General for Scotland or my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary can find somewhere in the annals of Scots legal history a term that will be satisfactory it would be very desirable to get rid of the worst connotations of "detention". At the same time however, I have my anxieties about reverting simply to "temporary arrest" at this stage which might appear purely cosmetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that all members of the Committee will agree with me. I am concerned that we are perhaps reading too much into the words of Thomson in paragraph 3.25. The report said—and it is important to remember it—is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have come to the conclusion that the period ought not to exceed six hours and we so 
	<i>recommend.</i>"</p></blockquote>
This is very different from a firm recommendation that the figure should be six hours and nothing above six hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that I think we have made progress. I remember when the definition of detention was made by the Under-Secretary who described it, I think
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
in an interview, by saying, that detention started when the man wanted to go home and found that he could not, or words to that effect. There has now been an indication by the Solicitor-General that the detention period of six hours begins from the moment the constable, wherever he may be, says, "I am detaining you". It might have been useful if we had seen a Government amendment which specifically said that the constable should say to the man, "I am detaining you", It might be useful to consider that perhaps on Report if we cannot do it today and if the Government will confirm that they intend to bring in such an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the difficulties is that the Under-Secretary is, in a sense, right. If someone goes on an invitation basis to a police station the six hours or the four hours or what have you will only start when he says that he wants to go home. The tragedy is that people do not know that they have the right to go home. It is in order to allow them to exercise that right by informing them of it that we need some additional safeguards in this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is right. There is all the difference between the informality of the previous position that we have been describing and the bringing in of a specific power. That of itself is a formality and the introduction of a formality requires a formality of commencement so that it is known and the man's right is known. I hope we will obtain an assurance that the Government intend to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have made some progress in that there are now Government amendments on the order paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it the clause as amended would read something as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The constable may … detain that person and take him as quickly as is reasonably practicable to a police station or other premises and, subject to the following provisions of this section, the detention may continue."</p></blockquote>
Later on under subsection (4), which is also included in this list of amendments, it now reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the time when a constable detains a person under subsection (1) above, he shall inform the person of his suspicion and the general nature of the offence which he suspects has been or is being committed and the reason for the detention; and there shall be recorded—

	<ol>

	<li>the place where detention begins arid the police station or other premises to which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
the person is taken;</li>

	<li>the general nature of the suspected offence"—</li></ol></p></blockquote>
These I think are Government amendments Nos. 36 to 39—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) the time when detention under subsection (1) above begins and the time of the person's arrival at the police station or other premises;"</p></blockquote>
and so on, as in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been useful and underlines what we were saying in the earlier debates on the Bill about the need for the Government to provide notes. I can see no reason why this thicket of amendments should not have been brought forward to us in that kind of statement, so that we would know exactly what we were dealing with. Progress has been made. However, an important beginning has been made, and we would seek now from them the promise of an amendment to spell out this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, we cannot treat detention as a form of punishment. Neither can we treat detention as a form of interrogation and investigation. It is a slightly hybrid procedure, but it must be related to the previous period in which it was seen as regular police practice. Indeed, the argument advanced in many quarters, and advanced again today, is that the purpose is to regularise existing practice. Whatever we are doing, whatever is the hybrid nature of this, the only way of preventing it from becoming hybrid is that it should be properly spelt out and the proper safeguards inserted, so that people understand their rights. I reiterate that many of us on this side of this House and many people in Scotland as a whole are opposed to the principle of detention. I accept the position of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) the former Under-Secretary. He has been perfectly honourable in standing by his position. He has not stood on his head on this question, unlike the Solicitor-General. There is a genuine disagreement here. It need cause no concern to Conservative Members that that should be so, because we are dealing with serious issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). I must say I won a little battle with myself. As everyone knows I was late. I was held up this morning, and I asked myself who would be the first person to raise the events of yesterday as somehow endorsing the bringing in of new police proceedings.
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
I won my bet on the hon. Member. We cannot adopt new police procedures on the basis of the heroic, but unfortunate events and necessities of yesterday. It is perfectly proper for us to respect and admire the behaviour of the police in these situations, as we unequivocally do. At the same time, the laws we are applying cannot be supported only because a policeman is brave or is correct. The laws must be correct in themselves, and that is what the hon. Member did not prove. Similarly, the long list of sins and crimes which he described is quite irrelevant to the crimes we are discussing. We should not do that when we are trying to get the law of Scotland set straight. I think the examples he brought forward to reinforce his argument for the 12 hours or 24 hours, seemed to prove precisely the opposite. They seemed to be the very ones which do not make his case. In the case of a 12-hour interrogation over baby battering, did he give the game away when he said that at the end of the day it would bring about a confession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the purpose of detention to bring about either a confession or conviction. That is for the formal process of judicial procedures later. We must not get them muddled. I hope that the Solicitor-General and others will help to spell this out. This is an introductory period in the process of looking for a judicial procedure, not the final process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three or four separate principles here. Those amendments are concerned only with the duration of detention. I have dealt with the arguments for six and 12 hours. If we are to have detention —and some of us regard this as an obnoxious provision—clearly the shorter the better. If it is not seen as a massive interrogation the shorter we can make it, the better. Therefore, quite unequivocally, I am in favour of four hours rather than six. I would hope on this occasion we would receive support from Conservative Members from the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) in view of the previous position of the chairman of the SNP on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not bound in this Committee by anything the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) did in a previous Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I just said that it gave us hope to believe that on this occasion he might act in a progressive fashion, especially as I read in the press over the weekend how strongly the SNP were opposed to these provisions and to the Bill. He is, after all, the leader of the SNP and is in a slightly more responsible position than I am as a humble Back Bencher disagreeing with my party. There is a rather different variation there which gives us more hope of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a little on the question of temporary arrest. Yes, there is anxiety that this can be seen only as cosmetic and I do not want that accusation to be made against the Government or ourselves. One reason for considering this kind of term is not the obloquy of the term "detention". We use this in other ways. No doubt there is another Scottish word that we could use, but that is not the important point. It was used in the hope that it might attract the safeguards and redress that would be written into the concept of arrest. However, since we are using it specifically as a separate term I do not see how it can bring in this redress, which must be written in in another way. Therefore I have no great objection to the withdrawal of the words "temporary arrest"—perhaps my hon Friends may be doing that—and to sticking to "detention", because I am concerned about the whole process becoming muddied. It must be made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the way, I think that it will be muddied also in the minds of police constables—the clash between the detainee's rights under detention and his rights at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to our amendment, amendment No. 20, and the amendment to it, amendment (a). My hon. Friends have set it out better, more clearly and more crisply than it is set out in the Government's amendment. It declares quite frankly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any period of detention … shall commence at the point where a constable indicates to a person that he is required to go to a police station."</p></blockquote>
That helps. What is still missing is the definition to be given by a constable at
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
that point or even earlier. It would begin at the moment of telling someone "I want you to come with me because I am detaining you. You are now under detention and you need not answer any questions."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are right in saying that "as soon as is practicable" is far too wide a concept and that we must have immediate reporting on arrival at the police station. If detention is written in in a formal way, the formality must be continued, and the formality should be the immediate reporting of this as soon as the constable arrives at the police station. Without giving way on anything that we have said in the past about our objection to detention, I recognise that some sense has got through some of the skulls on the Government Benches and that some movement has taken place. It does not of itself improve the concept, but it ensures that at least one of the safeguards is written into what some of us think a thoroughly undesirable provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sat through this morning's debate and listened with great care to the arguments. I am extremely disappointed that Conservative Members have not been able to defend their case. I do not agree with what is proposed in the Bill. I am opposed to the clause in principle and could not support it in any event. But I thought that, as so many Conservative Members had a background in the legal profession— and some a distinguished background— at least they would have displayed their skills in arguing their case. But they have not. They have not even been able to defend the principle, never mind the detail of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) were quite extraordinary. He read us a series of events of yesterday's date from English newspapers. As I understand it, the English police already have the kind of powers which are being proposed. If the police have these powers, how does the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire account for yesterday's outbreak of seeming lawlessness. He ought to have clarified that for us. That is not a very serious point but I want to make a serious point about what he had to say about family violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us in the House take an interest in social work and in matters referring to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
social work, to the condition of society, to family life and the role of the family, and to the support of the family. I have heard nothing to justify the introduction of detention. The more that the hon. Member was pressed to say in what way six hours' detention or, as he was arguing, 12 hours or 24 hours, would help, the less was he able to demonstrate in what way that would support the family which was in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members would do better, rather than trying to pressure us into this kind of legislation, to think of means to support the family. That is the only way to cope with violence in the family because the family is not always a unit which produces tranquillity and peace at home. Indeed, violence in the family is a serious social problem. Social workers devote all their lives to that area of activity. That is right and I should like to think that hon Members give these people support rather than make the kind of speeches which we heard this morning on child battering and family violence. I am sure that that will find its way into certain local newspapers but it is not a contribution which in my opinion does anything to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument which the Thomson committee offered for the proposals before us has not been demonstrated to be sound. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) has promised never to quote from that report again. That demonstrates what a splendid man he is. For the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) simply to argue that because the Thomson committee says something it is right—and he had the support of the hon. Member for Edingburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) at one point with this defence—and to say that, because the police witnesses said to the committee that it was right, therefore it is right and their conclusions are right, is not acceptable. It does not sound to me as though their case was well argued. They list English members of that Committee and say that, because these distinguished people say so, it is right. Not all of them are lawyers. I know one member of the Thomson committee. I know her to be a woman of a certain judgment. When one gathers people together in a committee and they draw a particular conclusion, other citizens—and we are other citizens—have a right to make an assessment of the arguments which
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
they have brought forward and to make our decision in the light of our experience, having considered what they said. My argument here is that the Thomson committee's case is not substantiated by argument. It simply makes an assertion. Conservative Members have defended that by saying that the Thomson committee asserts it, and that it does so because the police witnesses have asserted it. That is not good enough. Those of us on the Labour side who are against that principle have already lost that battle on Second Reading, as you, Mr. Gourlay, have rightly reminded us once or twice. However, we will argue it again on clause stand part. There are those of us who consider that the adoption of six hours will mean that it will become the norm. We have argued already that the police are simply seeking to regularise a practice that exists already. We have no guarantee in the statute that there will not be an abuse if it becomes six hours, or that if the Perthshire principle were adopted it would not be just as bad. I oppose this proposal in principle and because I have heard no case for it. I am a great believer in hearing a case. I have spent a lifetime listening to people advocating cases and trying to persuade me to do things. As a trade union official I was amazed at some of the things people tried unsuccessfully to persuade me to do. Even so they always argued a case. No case has been argued today. The clause should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the opportunity to respond briefly to what the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said. My hon. Friends have responded to it, and dealt with most of the points. I should like to take up his last point that the period should be either 12 or 24 hours. I assume that because the latest amendment that he put down was for 24 hours, that that was his latest opinion, and the one he favoured. He then went on to suggest that the whole process of interrogation over 24 hours should be covered by video-tape recording. Where are the hon. Member's amendments on that? With all due respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), there are no amendments on video-tape recording. We have them down in respect of tape-recording, or video, but his proposal was specifically for video-tape. I suggest, and hope, that he has down his own amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
ments on that, and I hope that my hon. Friend is right, and that he will vote for our amendment on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is, has he considered, as a major exponent of cutting public expenditure—we have all heard him on many occasions, both outside and within this House, expounding the principles of public expenditure and the need for restraint—exactly what his proposals mean in terms of public expenditure on 24 hours' video-taping? I am no expert, because I cannot afford—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for giving way. I would just draw attention to the difference between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure. To install video-taping equipment is a one-off capital outlay. Revenue expenditure is incurred in bringing individuals before the courts. I cited the examples from questions that I have asked—the many instances of cases coming on second diets with a guilty plea which would not occur if the proceedings had been video-taped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, up to a point. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan)—who I gather has one of these machines, tells me that it costs £14 for a video cassette, and that it lasts for three hours. That is roughly £100 per interview, because the whole 24 hours has to be recorded on tape. Even if the person is allowed to go to sleep for eight hours, the fact that he is asleep must be recorded, otherwise some smart lawyer—there are one or two on the Conservative Benches—would be on his feet saying "What about that eight hours that were not covered by the video-taping? What happened during that period?" The police may say that he was asleep, but they say, "Well, we cannot be sure of that, because there is no video-tape to prove it." An enormous cost is thus involved in this, not only a capital cost, which is large, but also a recurrent cost. I ask him to think seriously about this. I am not discouraging him on video-tape recordings. If we are talking about six hours, or four hours, we suggest that that is a perfectly reasonable cost. But 24 hours would suddenly place an enormous and unbearable extra burden on the public purse. To video-tape for 24 hours would mean having to cover the period of sleep,
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
the period of eating meals and all the rest. That would not, I think, be tenable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One last point which the hon. Member raised was the question of the person involved in child-beating or family violence, which often took place when the person was under the influence of drink. He seemed to suggest that the longer the period of detention the more chance there was of the person admitting that he had committed an offence. I find that difficult to believe. I would accept that there may be some people who, as the hangover takes over, will have a certain sense of contrition for what they have done. But in many other cases most people are more likely to babble when they have had a few drinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->

The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) in a previous sitting, quoted scripture on the basis that there was a time for everything under the sun, which for some extraordinary reason he attributed to the Book of Proverbs, as opposed to the Book of Ecclesiastes. I am reminded, listening to Labour Members of verse 9 of the same chapter
	<br><blockquote><p>"The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done."</p></blockquote>
Labour Members who are not lawyers— they remind us that we are lawyers— might have that in mind in future.

I hope to answer the points made in the debate. The Government amendments, Nos. 144 and 145, are purely consequential. Amendments No. 146 to 148 clarify a matter which was highlighted in amendment No. 31, which was the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) to ensure that a person is told of his right to communicate with a solicitor or other person when he reaches the police station.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Solicitor-General is not suggesting that amendments 146 to 148 relate to clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not suggesting that, but I felt it right to mention them in this context. They are of course amendments to clause 3, but they relate to powers which operate under clause 2, so that is why I thought it right to mention them at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the words "temporary arrest", I appreciate that some people have an objection to the word "detention". It was the word taken, and I do not find it less attractive than "temporary arrest". However I think the words "temporary arrest" are doubly unfortunate. First of all it is not "temporary" arrest because the powers and consequences of arrest do not temporarily flow from it and therefore it is a misnomer which might be very misleading. Theoretically, a person would have to be temporarily charged if he were temporarily arrested. The term "temporary arrest" is unfortunate for that reason, and also for the reason that the term "temporary arrest" is used in England and, so far as I can make out, if I have been reading my newspapers with the perspicuity of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), there are persons in London who are undergoing temporary arrest for periods of days which are far in excess of the periods of hours that we are presently proposing. It would therefore, be most unfortunate to adopt an English term which clearly has a totally different meaning and involves totally different powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a word which means detention but does not say "detention", perhaps we can find it in Roget's Thesaurus. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) may look for a name which does not have the unfortunate connotations, at any rate in Yorkshire and
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
Lancashire, that his does. Perhaps he may call himself in future "George Détain"—Monsieur Detain. Or, in his case, Pétain might be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can find words meaning "detention" and "detain" which are not "detention" and "detain" and anyone cares to field them, the Government would look at them sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we come to the question of the duration of six hours. I want to make the position clear. At present in law, at common law, as in the future at common law, a policeman can take a person to a police station and keep him there on a voluntary basis for as long as he likes. The person can leave whenever he wants. That is a very theoretical concept for this reason. Peter Thomas Anthony Manuel was in a police station for more than 24 hours—and no one should tell me that he was voluntarily assisting them to inquire into the death of Ann Neillands when eventually he told them where her body was and took them to it. In theory, he was there voluntarily. And if the Labour Members had their way, he would have been released necessarily after six hours because the police had no evidence upon which they could charge him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition must look at the realities of the situation and remember that we are not dealing with little boys who are running about in housing schemes making a nuisance of themselves. We are dealing with very serious criminals in extremely difficult circumstances in which obtaining evidence against the evildoer may be very difficult. Let us be absolutely certain that it was during that period that Manuel provided the only evidence which could have resulted in his conviction and, had he not done so, how many other lives might have been lost? That is the reality of what we are dealing with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we all appreciate the point the Solicitor-General is making, but under his own provisions would Manuel not be released after six hours? Is that not what is being suggested by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly. Under this provision if Manuel were not there on a voluntary basis he would have to be released after six hours. And I want the Opposition to understand what the implications of it may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
when we start talking about that being too short a time. But that is the time which the police have said would be a useful minimum in most cases. Therefore, that is the time which Thomson recommended and that is the time which the Government have accepted from that recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members in this room were, with the exception of the right hon. Member for Western Isles, elected on the understanding that they would bring in, whichever party formed the Government, a criminal justice Bill containing the concept of detention. Therefore, I do not think that anybody can say that he is against the principle because of this provision. If we do not have the principle of detention, either we have fictional co-operation or the police have no power to take a person whom they believe is involved in a crime and carry out an investigation. That is the alternative. Either it is fictional or there is no power. To have the power of detention in the event of non-co-operation is an essential weapon in the law's armoury,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General will accept that for many of us the election was not fought on the platform of detention. As far as I know, it was not a specific election pledge. Certainly for individual hon. Members it was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General talks about the practical realities of the situation and hints —I think that I am picking him up correctly—that the police on occasions detain people although they have no legal right to do so at the moment. They detain them on a "voluntary" basis when there is nothing voluntary about it. Does the Solicitor-General condone that? Would he condone it if the police thought that they had a serious malefactor on their hands, their six hours had run out, and they proceeded to hold him on this so-called voluntary basis? That is not a practice that we should refer to as the practical reality of the situation. It is a practice that should not happen and ought to stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The exact purpose of clause 2 is to give power which enables it to stop. Previously everybody was held on a voluntary basis, but it is unrealistic to pretend that it was voluntary. I should be extremely surprised
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
if the late Manuel took the view that he was held on a voluntary basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that we are introducing this power. We believe that the power is inevitable, but it does not alter the common law right to invite a person to a police station and to ask him any questions with or without caution as may be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) argued that six hours was about the right time. I think that it is the right time because it is a considerable time. It is what the police said would in most cases be adequate. I hope that they will be able to carry out such inquiries as they must in that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take a practical situation. To set up an identification parade and get the witness to view the parade takes a great deal of time. To restrict the time too much means that the release will be required of people before enough evidence can be collected for them to be charged. To charge a person without evidence is thoroughly unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire said that a great many people are proved to be innocent. What he meant was that a great many who are charged are either found not guilty or the charge is found not proven. That does not mean that they did not commit the offence. All it means is that the presumption of innocence has not been discharged, for a variety of reasons. An essential witness may have died or he may have gone back on his statement. Technically there may not be corroboration. There are all sorts of reasons for acquittal. I want to put on record that it must not be assumed that the rate of acquittal is an indication of the number of people who are innocent and wrongly charged. It is purely the indication of the number of people against whom charges are not proved, and nothing more. To deduce further conclusions from that would be wrong. It must not be prayed in aid that we have the benefit of a system where acquittal can result to suggest that that system is wrong in charging them in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General is falling into the opposite error. He is assuming that all those whom the police take along to the police station are guilty unless some flaw in the indictment or something allows them to get away with it. He is assuming that the

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making any such assumption.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all sorts of reasons for acquittal. I am saying that the fact that there are acquittals is not an indication that wrong charges were brought in the first place. That is all that I am saying and I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for clearing that matter up.

Amendment No. 20 is not acceptable to the Government for a variety of reasons. The suspect must be released in any event whenever the six hours are up and to detain him thereafter would amount to wrongful detention. Once he is detained, he is being forcibly detained and unless he were advised that the police were no longer forcibly detaining him, he would be wrongfully detained after six hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not so. I accept the point that in theory at the end of the six-hour period compulsion ends and at that point a person is free to go. We are living in the real world about which he made such a point only a few minutes ago and I accept that. Will he not agree with me that it would be an extremely useful corrective against abuse which might creep into police practice if the police had specifically to inform someone that, if he wished, he could then leave? Then, of course, if he stays on, he is doing it on a genuinely voluntary basis. There is no harm in having that safeguard. It can only ensure that the law is carried out, as I am sure that the Solicitor-General would want it to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied, as was the Opposition spokesman in the House of Lords when this matter was debated there, that the safeguard is unnecessary because the position will arise in the course of ordinary police practice and the police can be trusted to carry out ordinary police practice. Unless
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is trying to envisage a situation where the police officer would put the clock forward or backward and say, "You arrived here only at 2 o'clock, not 12 o'clock", to find manipulative ways round the six hours, he is bound, if he is not wrongly detaining the person, to tell him that the six hours is up and he can go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. I cannot understand what the Solicitor-General means when he says that a policeman is bound to tell the person that the six hours are up and he may go. That is what I am trying to write into the statute and the hon. and learned Gentleman is resisting it. The situation I envisage which might happen in the real world is that, someone is taken in under clause 2, the six hours very properly tick away, the man is locked in the charge room as the six hours expire and the police keep him there. Of course, if somebody is aware of his rights and has studied the Bill, he will know that he is able to say to the officer in charge that he would now like to go. In fact, that right may not be exercised through lack of knowledge and the matter will go by default. I know of no reason for thinking that inevitably as a matter of practice he will be told that he may leave. If that is the case, there is no harm in putting it on a statutory basis to reassure the doubting Thomases such as myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the hon. Member, if he has been detained, he is not dis-detained by the passage of time. He is only dis-detained by dedetention. He is wrongly detained by the passage of time. There is therefore, in my opinion, no necessity whatever to accept that requirement. If Labour Members are so suspicious of the police that the whole of the police manual and all the instructions of chief constables and all the guidelines of Secretaries of State have to be written into statute, perhaps it would help if some of them could be recruited into the police force for a while. We could then see how they would do the job, trammelled around, as they want to make it, with all sorts of statutory difficulties. They would realise that the public would not be protected against those who commit crimes and those the police have the extremely difficult task of bringing to court and of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that we must ask the Solicitor-General to reconsider what he has just said. Up to now, the argument has been either the false argument that it was police practice anyway and should be regularised, or what I would regard as the true argument, that we require this power of detention, and that it should properly be six hours, and be made regular or made formal in that way. Equally, is it not true that, when the six hours pass, that formality ends? Either the Solicitor-General is saying that they will continue that which was irregular before, and which this provision was supposed to deal with by making regular, or he must allow the situation that a man can no longer be detained. If a man can no longer be detained, if this is merely a formality, why should we not be informed, if only to prevent the police, whom I am also seeking to protect, finding themselves in a wrong position? This is what then may happen. He would have wrong-footed the police, and put them into an illegal position, if they had continued the detention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the book records that a man was detained at 12 and he is still there at 6.30, he has been wrongly detained for half an hour. Certainly, nothing he said during the period from 6 to 6.30 would be admissable. If he says he wishes to stay, then of course, he can stay for the rest of his life if he wants. The police would have to establish that thereafter if he was there voluntarily. If they are to establish that on a false basis, it does not matter whether they say they told him the period was up or they did not tell him the period was up. The position would be exactly the same in the end. It is not cured by such a statutory inclusion, and that amendment is not acceptable to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"When a constable exercises the power

In the circumstances of an investigation, to find the senior police officer in a police station and justify to him why one is detaining somebody is no safeguard at all. He is not involved in the case. In order to convince him that one has a suspect it does not seem to me to be a safeguard or a sensible suggestion. I agree with the concept but, as the Opposition spokesman said in another place, "it is not necessary to put this into the Bill, and ordinary police practice would take care of exactly what the Thomson recommended."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 January 1980; vol. 404, c. 724.] That remark was made by the last Labour Solicitor-General for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather taken by surprise when the Solicitor-General sat down rather suddenly. This has been a very long and important debate, and I suspect that the last 20 minutes have given the Solicitor-General's hon. Friends nightmares. I was watching them when the Solicitor-General was drawing out all the examples that he was quoting in favour of the Government amendments and rejecting Opposition amendments. I do not think I am understating the expression on some of the advocates' faces; they were horrified by some of the things which the Solicitor-General was writing into the debate and which, as I said earlier, will no doubt be quoted in years to come by those who practise in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the outstanding statements of the Solicitor-General—and I use "outstanding", I suppose, out of context—is that if a detained person is detained beyond the six hours he is wrongfully detained. Of course, he is wrongfully detained, but what redress does the detained person have? That highlights the dangers of not specify-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
ing the period of detention, when it begins, when it ends, and giving that information to the person when he is taken either to the police station or to the other place as described in the Bill. I know it is specified in a sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the other difficulties that we have had during this debate has been the new amendments. They have been tabled by the Government in the intervening period between Tuesday of last week and Tuesday of this week, and the effect of these amendments and the amendments which were already tabled has been that in the first 25 lines of page 3, clause 2, 13 lines have been altered. It is very difficult to fit into those 13 lines the additional words that have been put down by the Government and then to study the meaning on a Tuesday morning when we have been given no prior notification of the amendments. As I said earlier, I hope that this is not a practice which the Government intend to follow as we go through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General did not spell out the purpose of the Government amendments, and in order that I can justify pressing amendment No. 20 to the vote, I have obviously got to say what the Government amendments mean. Here I should say to my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that amendment (a) to amendment No. 20 is acceptable, and there is nothing between us on that. The Government amendments spell it out, I admit, in some detail, but one must read the context in which the Bill is written to understand that the detention begins when the person is actually detained and not when he is taken to the police station. The new section would read, at the top of page 3:
	<br><blockquote><p>"detain that person and take him as quickly as is reasonably practicable to a police station or other premises and, subject to the following provisions of this section, the detention may continue."</p></blockquote>
For detention to continue, it is reasonable to assume that it has started, but people have to read that kind of meaning into what has been said, whereas if our amendment No. 20 were to be accepted, obviously much of that doubt would be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that the Committee should come to a decision, and for that reason I am suggesting to my hon. Friends and
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
to the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) that we should support amendment No. 20, I say that in order to give the Conservative advocates time to study the difference between amendment No. 20 and the Government amendments, and to view both sets of amendments against the background of the reply that we have just had from the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what the advocates are interested in is protecting their profession, I strongly suspect that we are just about to have the first victory on the Opposition side of the Committee. If, on the other hand, what the advocates are interested in is merely bulldozing through legislation—even bad legislation—then I strongly suspect that we shall go on to yet one more defeat. That remains to be seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 also deals with the point as does amendment No. 19, about the proposal to reduce the period of detention from six to four hours. I never heard any substantial arguments put forward during our debate this morning as to why the period should be six hours rather than four hours. I absolutely resist the temptation to enter into the argument that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) put to the Committee. I thought it was so irrelevant that I should be wasting the time of the Committee if I replied to it. However, apart from the fact that some policemen said to Thomson that six hours would be very helpful, there is no other evidence to suggest that there is a major difference between four hours and six hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said four hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, and what I said at the last meeting of the Committee was that the judgment in favour of four hours was just as strong as the judgment in favour of six hours. Apart from the police witnesses to Thomson, there is no other evidence, from the Faculty of Advocates, from the Law Society, or from the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties. In actual fact, that body said that very reluctantly, if it had to accept it, six hours but no more, might be acceptable. That seemed to convey the impression, rightly or wrongly, that less than six hours would be more acceptable. So there are no strong arguments on either side about whether it should be six hours or four hours. Our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
argument—as it was on the last Bill—is that four hours is perfectly adequate for the police to carry out their initial investigation. I speak as someone who wants to see this principle succeed as a principle and for that reason I am absolutely convinced that four hours is much more acceptable than six.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of amendment No. 20 is equally important and it ought not to be overlooked. It refers to the position where a suspect is taken to the police station. The officer taking that suspect to the police station has to report to the senior officer in charge of the police station, and the senior officer has then to make the decision on whether or not the detention is justified, and, if it is not justified, the suspect should be released. That is an added safeguard that I should have thought Conservative Members would have been quite keen to accept, and for that reason I am anxious, on behalf of my hon. Friends, to press amendment No. 20, and amendment No. 19, which is associated with it, and which would reduce the period of detention from six to four hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other question that must arise— and it has not been dealt with—is the rights of the detained person. I got the impression, from something that the Under-Secretary said on Second Reading, that the rights of a detained person were equal to the rights of a person who had been arrested in a situation where the arrested person had been wrongfully arrested. Now we seem to be given the impression that there is no such thing as someone being wrongfully detained, and I am just wondering where and in what situation a police officer taking a suspected person to a police station would be called upon to justify his grounds for suspicion. We seem to be providing for a situation in which someone can be taken to a police station and detained for up to six hours, and at no stage, even when the person is released and no charges are preferred, will the police officer be required to justify his grounds for suspicion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman must accept that the police, on the basis of their normal day-to-day management and operations, would expect their constables to behave responsibly? Part of behaving responsibly would be that they would bring people in only when they had reasonable grounds for suspicion. If they
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
brought them in on any other grounds, the higher management in the police would take action because they were falling down on their normal duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire at this early stage in our proceedings that, far from supporting the police, some of his utterances are seriously damaging to them. He ought to be careful. What he is now saying is that a policeman who takes someone into a police station because he has grounds for suspecting that he has been involved in the commission of an offence, does not need to justify those grounds, even after it has been proved conclusively that that person was not involved. That is not in the interests of the police and the police do not want that kind of responsibility thrown on them. There is absolutely nothing here that says that a police officer will be called upon at one stage or another to justify his reasonable grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all honesty, we shall have to come back to this—if not in this Bill then in subsequent legislation. Once the complaints start rolling in to Members of Parliament at their weekly surgeries, we shall have to come back to that point. I make that prediction now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General's other point was interesting—that the rate of acquittal should not be equated with the number of wrongful charges. I raised an eyebrow at that, on reflection, I think that, once the police have charged someone, it is up to the Procurator-Fiscal to decide whether the case should go to court or should proceed no further. I certainly accept that the police charge people on the basis that they believe that there are ample grounds for taking them to court. But we are fortunate in Scotland in the sense that the police do not have that authority. It is not part of their function in society to take these people to court. That is the responsibility of the Procurator-Fiscal. So perhaps the Solicitor-General had a point there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point was on our amendments dealing with temporary arrest. We have had an interesting debate on whether we should change from detention to temporary arrest. As I said at the beginning, these were in any case probing amendments. We were anxious to find out the thinking of the Committee to see if we could come up with some other description
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
for the period before someone is released or actually charged with a suspected offence. Our debate has shown the difficulty of coming up with a word not only acceptable but understandable to describe the situation in which someone has not been charged or arrested, but finds himself detained in a police station for up to six hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were not convinced—and I suspect that many Conservative Members were not convinced—by the Solicitor-General's reply. In fact, we were far from convinced by the Solicitor-General's arguments. One of the weaknesses of lawyers is that they are inclined to draw on cases in which they have acted in the past. My hon. Friend said that hard cases make bad law, and there is a lot in that. I suspect that many of the Conservative advocates were very worried by some of the things that the Solicitor-General said. If that is so, and they want to take that a stage further, they have an opportunity. They can reject the Government's amendments, and they can accept the Opposition's amendments, because ours is more detailed, is better, and everything it does is spelled out more clearly. It would have a greater effect and, further, it would reduce the period to four hours. I would not want anyone to think in voting for amendment No. 20 that it did not have the effect of reducing the period to four hours. It would have that effect, and I favour the principle that the reduction to four hours is desirable. I therefore invite my hon. Friends, the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), and some Conservative hon. Members—to strike a real blow for common sense on this Committee for a change—and to join us in pressing the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly on one point, in response to what the Solicitor-General said. In replying to what he said on amendment No. 20, he called into his argument what was said by the Opposition spokesman in the other place. A similar amendment was put down in the other place, asking for this same power, that the officer in charge of the station should be informed and that he should be the person who granted detention. He called into his arguments what was said by the Opposition spokesman. It is interesting that he did not call into his argument what was said by the Government spokesman on that occasion,
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
Lord Mansfield, who said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nevertheless, as I have indicated, I have some sympathy with the principle behind this amendment and if the noble Lord, Lord Foot would be good enough to withdraw it I will look at the matter to see whether a suitable provision should be added to the Bill."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 January 1980; Vol. 404, col. 725.]</p></blockquote>
That was a clear commitment by the Government spokesman in the other place, that they would look at the amendment, would come back, and would at least give us a clear statement; yet the Solicitor-General has irresponsibly passed over it with merely a reference to the Opposition spokesman in the other place, and not to his own spokesman, who gave a commitment that this point would be looked at and considered. In no way has he even tried to give an answer to that commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes a little more deeply than that, because the Solicitor-General would not have referred to this matter if I had not reminded him of it. He had to be heavily briefed by the Under-Secretary even on the selected quotations that he used. Does the hon. and learned Member agree that we are at least entitled to an explanation as to what consideration was given? It was specifically on a promise of consideration that the amendment was withdrawn and not pressed in the other place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. It does go deeper. As he suggests, the Solicitor-General was not even going to refer to this matter, yet the Government gave a commitment that they would consider the amendment. It was withdrawn in the other place only on that basis. I am sure that, if that commitment had not been given, Lord Foot would have pressed the amendment and might very well have carried it. We do not know. Yet the Solicitor-General has skated over it, and was prepared not to answer it or even to give us any concept of what consideration has been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree, since we are so near to 1 o'clock, that it would not be a bad idea if Ministers could get together with their advisers between now and 4.30 p.m., and come back with a prepared statement to let the Committee know exactly what consideration was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
given to this matter, and why the promise made has been yet one more promise broken by the Government? We have three-and-a-half hours for them to come up with this answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friends, and am happy to sit down
