	<div class='legislation'>Draft Legal Aid (Prescribed Panels) Regulations 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Legal Aid (Prescribed Panels) Regulations 1998.</p></blockquote>
May I say, Mr. Jones, how pleased I am to see you in charge of this Committee, knowing your keen interest in matters to do with the legal system? I am sure that you will be much entertained by these regulations, whose purpose is to establish the clinical negligence franchise panel as a prescribed panel for the purposes of section 32(7) of the Legal Aid Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clinical negligence franchise panel epitomises the philosophy underlying the Government's reforms of legal aid. The reforms are designed to direct legal aid funding to those who need it most. We want also to channel legal aid funding through providers of legal services who have demonstrated a recognisable standard of administrative efficiency and specialist expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that medical, or, as it should now be known, clinical, negligence cases require a particular expertise. Few people—professional or not—would argue with that. Expertise is gained by doing the work and doing it regularly. Firms that only occasionally undertake specialist cases such as clinical negligence claims are unlikely to develop the experience and skill that a firm with a regular case load has. They are also unlikely to achieve the results for their clients that an experienced firm would. That is a proven fact. Results obtained in cases funded by legal aid demonstrate conclusively that lawyers who are members of the Law Society's medical negligence panel or the Action for Victims of Medical Accidents panel achieve much better results. They win more cases and obtain higher damages. In 1996–97, panel members achieved on average damages of about £48,500 compared with only £21,800 achieved by non-panel-member lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore important for clients that clinical negligence claims are directed only to franchised firms with a contract. That will not reduce access to justice. Contracts will be granted to a sufficient number of firms to ensure that the expected 6,000 clinical negligence claims a year are properly dealt with. In rural areas where the population is widely dispersed and people find it difficult to get to a contracted firm, it will be part of firms' contracts that, where necessary, the solicitor will travel to the client to take instructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no difficulty in new lawyers entering the field of clinical negligence litigation. New and inexperienced lawyers can work for a solicitor in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
franchised firm. Having gained the experience necessary for admission to one of the accredited panels, they will then be eligible to be included in the prescribed panel and to obtain contracts themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To let the public, the legal profession and other interested parties know about the new clinical negligence category, there will be a comprehensive publicity campaign. The campaign will let people know where and how they can obtain the advice and assistance that they need. Posters and leaflets will explain the necessity of seeing a solicitor who is a member of the panel. This information will be made available in the usual public places, as well as in citizens advice bureaux, law centres and other legal advice agencies. Information about the Legal Aid Board's free phone-in service, which will provide information on which solicitors' firms have clinical negligence contracts, will also be provided. Solicitors are also being informed of which law firms have contracts, so that new cases can be referred to the right place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firms with members on the panel will be granted contracts to undertake work on behalf of assisted persons with clinical negligence cases from 1 February 1999. After that date, only firms on the panel will be able to conduct such cases. There is one exception, for the 2,000 firms that currently have a franchise contract to conduct personal injury cases. The personal injury franchise has until now included clinical negligence work. Those 2,000 firms will be able to continue to work on new clinical negligence claims until 31 July. After that date, they will need to qualify for a clinical negligence franchise to be able to take on new clinical negligence cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations give effect to the decision that I announced on 16 July 1998 in a written reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), following the response to our consultation paper "Access to justice with conditional fees".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are required because section 32(1) of the Legal Aid Act 1988 creates a general right for a person receiving advice, assistance or representation to select the legal representative to advise, assist or act on his or her behalf from among the legal representatives who are willing to provide advice, assistance or representation under the Act. That right may be qualified under regulations made under section 32(7), so that the person receiving assistance may select assistance only from legal representatives who are currently members of a prescribed panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 1 provides for the regulations' description and the date—1 February 1999—on which they are to come into force, subject to approval by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 2 interprets the important terms used in the regulations. I will not deal with all of them, but I should explain why the term "clinical negligence" rather than the previously used term "medical negligence" has been adopted. The term "clinical" is sufficiently wide to include all those who provide medical, clinical and other health services, such as radiographers, dentists and nurses. Clinical negligence describes more appropriately the type of negligence claims that arise in all health care-related claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Regulation 3 establishes the clinical negligence franchise panel. It will consist of those solicitors who are already members of the Law Society's medical negligence panel or the Action for Victims of Medical Accidents panel. It is already a requirement that a firm requiring a clinical negligence franchise must have a member of staff who is also a member of one of the two accredited panels that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4 sets out the scope of the regulations in relation to particular types of claim. It also limits the right of a person requiring legally aided representation to select a representative under Section 32(1) of the 1988 Act. It makes it clear that other powers enjoyed by the board to limit representation for civil legal aid pursuant to a contract, which are contained in Section 32(2) of the 1988 Act, are not affected by these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should explain that, although the regulations may have a short life because of the repeal of the Legal Aid Act 1988 by the Access to Justice Bill, the arrangements are intended to continue indefinitely. We are keen to establish a high standard of quality among the providers of clinical negligence legal services. We want to begin that task before undertaking the more fundamental reforms envisaged by the Access to Justice Bill, which is now before Parliament. The regulations will continue to apply until the new Act is enacted, when they will no longer be necessary because the provisions of the Access to Justice Bill will enable us to set and monitor the standards of legal service providers, and to secure the services of providers through contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission will therefore be able to respond quickly if, for example, the requirements for admission to either panel are reduced below an acceptable level. However, the regulations are necessary under the provisions of the present legislation to enable us to limit representation to quality suppliers only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the regulations to the Committee and the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Gamier 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones. May I join the Minister in welcoming you to the Committee? I doubt that you will find our subject entertaining, but you will probably find it more interesting than do many Government Back Benchers in this Committee and throughout the House of Commons. As far as I can see, they have not paid much attention to the progress of the Access to Justice Bill. Judging by the Minister's comments in the Chamber yesterday, I doubt whether he has read the Bill at all. Clearly, he has read the regulations before us, but I doubt whether he has fully appreciated the constitutional anomaly that they throw up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to point out that the regulations are made under section 32 of the Legal Aid Act 1988, which will be repealed by the Access to Justice Bill. At first blush, the Lord Chancellor's Department has produced a characteristically hasty piece of work. The regulations anticipate the repealing of the 1988 Act at a time when the Access to Justice Bill, which is to repeal it, has not yet been fully scrutinised by the House or the other place—it has just finished the third day of its Committee stage in the Lords. That Bill will give the Lord
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Chancellor 17 new powers, which is the largest acquisition of Executive power by a Law Officer or Minister in charge of the judiciary with which the House has had to deal since the granting of universal suffrage. The Bill steamrollers on through the Lords and, with the compliant majority enjoyed by the Government, will no doubt be similarly pushed through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the timing of the regulations. Similar regulations might be made after the Access to Justice Bill has been enacted, but to sneak the regulations through now, while that Bill is still being discussed in the other place and has yet to be discussed in the House, is, at the least, unwise. For that constitutional reason alone, the Committee should reject the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, approximately 10,000 solicitors' firms offer advice and representation under legal aid. Through their policies, the Government will reduce that number to about 3,000 firms. That is a remarkable definition of access to justice, and in other circumstances the proposals would be subject to far fiercer criticism. The regulations give the Lord Chancellor, as a member of the Executive, huge additional powers to control who may appear in the courts and offer legal advice. The Minster seemed to admit that that could easily be achieved through the market. As he said, some solicitors' firms are expert in the field of clinical and medical negligence and attract most of the work because they do it well and successfully. They achieve the best results on behalf of their lay clients. Why therefore do we need now, before the Access to Justice Bill is enacted, a restrictive set of regulations to limit the firms of lawyers that are entitled to take on such work—when, as the Minister has admitted, the system already limits the category of solicitors that undertake such work, by virtue of their expertise? There is a glaring illogicality in the Government's approach to the regulations and to the legislation behind them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proper scrutiny of the regulations should be delayed until the Access to Justice Bill has become law—in other words, until the other place has completed its full deliberation of the Bill, the House has discussed it on Second Reading, with all that that implies, and a Standing Committee has given it due and proper consideration. It should not be for this Committee to waive the regulations through. I accept that section 32(7) of the 1988 Act gives the Government power to make regulations restricting the choice of representation and, were the Access to Justice Bill not being considered, many of my objections to the regulations would not now apply. However, because the Government have chosen to dismantle much of what is good in our legal system and have decided radically to alter the way in which legal services are provided to the general public, we should resist the implementation of the regulations at this stage. I therefore urge the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you, Mr. Jones, as Chairman of our Committee. We share the Government's abhorrence of the way in which the Access to Justice Bill will sweep away the doctrine of separation of powers in many important respects, because separation of powers is tenuous and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
muddied enough in our constitution. However, that matter can wait for another day, when the Bill comes before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations should provide the public with an assurance of higher standards and expertise in a particularly difficult area of litigation—medical and clinical negligence and related matters. The regulations should secure better value for public money. It is not in the interests of the taxpayer or the public that a lawyer should conduct a case unless she or he can cope with its complexities. Specialisation should be encouraged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that under the current system specialisation is not encouraged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that specialisation is encouraged, but there is an opportunity for legally aided litigants still to be represented by people who do not have the skills and expertise that they should have. The regulations are a step forward in ensuring that litigants can bank on a sufficiently high-calibre lawyer to cope with this particularly difficult area of litigation. As I understand the regulations, to be a member of the medical negligence panel or a member of the Law Society's Action for Victims of Medical Accidents panel will be a sine qua non for acting for any litigant who is to be supported by legal aid. Being on the clinical negligence franchise panel should be a useful indication of specialisation and expertise, not just for those who are legally aided but for those who will conduct the litigation from their own means and are looking for an appropriately qualified lawyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the importance of those two qualifications—for the clinical negligence franchise panel envisaged in the regulations and for the Law Society's AVMA panel—I should be grateful if the Minister would give the Committee replies to the following questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what are the qualifications to be included on the franchise panel, and how do they differ from those for the AVMA panel? Secondly, is grandfathering to be permitted for the franchise panel and, if so, will the Minister explain exactly who is to qualify, and why, under any grandfathering provisions? Thirdly, I am interested to know who will monitor the standards for these qualifications and who will decide on the qualifications or further qualifications. Will such decisions be taken solely by the Lord Chancellor, whose unfettered decision will be final and absolute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, will the Minister confirm that the regulations will not affect existing cases, and that the conduct of existing legally aided cases will continue to be carried on by the current solicitors, even if they are not members of either panel? Fifthly, will the Minister explain to the Committee the criteria that the Legal Aid Board will follow in choosing barristers to act in legally aided medical negligence cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will be anxious that any panel does not become a closed shop or restrictive practice but will be open to all who satisfy the qualifications and will not be limited artificially, for
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
example, by a finite pool of members, or experience that can be obtained only in large cities. Regrettably, medical negligence occurs throughout the country, and the public anywhere must be able to tap in to that expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to issue a warning to the Minister. The advantages of specialisation will be denied if the individual whom the client has chosen to act on his behalf is not the person who conducts the matter. The panel member should not be simply the net to catch legal aid work. Cases must be handled by the panel member rather than by an inexperienced or insufficiently qualified individual. I hope that they will be monitored sufficiently so that such potential abuse can be avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Audrey Wise 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to say only a few words to the Committee. I would not have spoken at all but for the gratuitous insult with which the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Gamier) began his remarks. I also noted that he dwelt on a matter with which the Committee is not concerned. I prefer to consider the matter before us. You were very indulgent in that respect, Mr. Jones, and you will doubtless be keeping a beady eye on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Lady is talking about the Access to Justice Bill. If it is of no relevance to the Committee, why did her hon. Friend the Minister mention it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Audrey Wise</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it would affect the life span of the regulations. If that Bill is not enacted, they will remain in force. My hon. Friend the Minister's reference to the Bill was therefore helpful and entirely relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on the fact that the regulations will take effect after the Committee sits. Before the last general election I sat on many such Committees. Unfortunately, we were frequently discussing regulations that had been implemented several months earlier. That is a constitutional outrage and an insult to the House. Perhaps such things still happen, but I am pleased that an attempt is clearly being made to break that mould. At least these regulations have yet to come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I must say that I agree with the regulations. People must be able to rely on legal representation in such complex matters, although I accept the proviso of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) that we should not create a fig leaf, behind which a variety of other people can do the actual work. With that proviso, and with sufficient monitoring, the regulations will not restrict choice. People will have the opportunity and the information to make informed choices. Some of my constituents have been led astray by incorrect legal advice and representation on such matters, and I welcome anything that will help them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I wish to take my cue from the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, who referred to the hazard, as he saw it—and as I see it—of the solicitor's equivalent of the returned brief. The name of a distinguished, well known and accomplished solicitor appears on whatever certificate is issued, yet his assistant solicitor turns up in discharge of the case, which is not what the client wanted. As a non-practising solicitor, I suppose that I ought to declare an interest; however, as may hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon knows, I went straight about 10 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the person without sufficient lustre and experience may end up attending to the case. It would be graceless of me to say that it can be even worse with the barristers' profession, but in 22 years as a solicitor I lost count of the number of times that a barrister whom I did not expect turned up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more serious note, the fundamental principle—which was always sound—was that someone seeking legal advice should have it from a person of their own unfettered choice. As with all fundamental principles, there can be derogations—there might be circumstances in which the client is better protected by having less choice. I can see that and I concede it. But will the Minister acknowledge that the majority of members of the Committee are about to enact a derogation from a previously fundamental freedom?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of interest, will the Minister also be kind enough to tell us whether he will hold discussions with the Law Society about amending that part of its rules which says that a client may have a solicitor of the client's unfettered choice? Clearly, the internal constitutions of the Law Society will have to be altered as a consequence of the regulations. I suggest, although the Minister might correct me, that, from first principles, the Law Society's rules must be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) eloquently and inadvertently reminds me that I have not declared an interest. I am a partner in a firm of solicitors, although I hope that I shall shortly be withdrawing from that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.57 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: if I have failed to entertain you, Mr. Jones, I sincerely apologise. We have certainly been entertained by Opposition Members, not least because there has been a constitutional anomaly. We have also swept away the doctrine of the separation of powers, which is a remarkable achievement for a modest statutory instrument Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was awaiting matters to be considered in future by the House, namely, the Access to Justice Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the constitutional anomaly, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough puzzles me a little. The regulations are being made under existing legislation, which was passed by a previous Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Government. Thus the powers that the Government are now exercising were promoted, I assume, by a Government whom the hon. and learned Member for Harborough supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister need not be puzzled—nor would he be, had he listened carefully to what I said. I frankly admitted that, as the wording of the regulations makes clear, these powers flow from section 32 of the 1988 Act, which was made when the Conservatives were in office. The expression currently used by the Labour party is "a moment of madness": the madness here is that the Access to Justice Bill is about to sweep away the 1988 Act, and yet the Government are intent on rushing the regulations through. It is a perfectly simple point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. As my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Audrey Wise) pointed out, if there is a problem it is clearly incumbent on the Government to address it. We want to ensure that those who seek advice and representation in relation to claims for clinical negligence have the best quality advice immediately available to them. There seems no reason to delay when a previous Government made available powers to deal with the problem. Perhaps I should regret that the Government who introduced legislation to provide for those powers did not exercise them. Nevertheless, we are using those powers and, I hope, using them sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to deal with two other points that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough raised. The Lord Chancellor will not control who appears in court—the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon was also concerned about this—by specifying that legal aid will be available to those who appear on panels. Those responsible for the constitution of the panels will determine who appears in court. That is a sensible and appropriate protection for the doctrine of the separation of powers, if I can resort to the language that the hon. Member of Torridge and West Devon used. There is no difficulty about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, I should also mention a few statistics, which I hope support the Government's case. In 1996–97, nearly 50 per cent, of legal and clinical negligence cases ended inconclusively, without trial or settlement. That means that those who advised at the outset that the cases merited the support of legal aid were wrong; they gave their clients poor advice. That means that those clients spent years awaiting the outcome of a case that they were told would be successful only to be disappointed. My hon. Friend the Member for Preston is right to say that it is necessary to protect such people from the anxieties of taking on cases that go nowhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes an interesting statistical point. Does he agree, however, that it could be mildly qualified in one sense? To have got a legal aid certificate in the first place, the applicant must have successfully got past the merits test. It would not merely have been the original advising solicitor who looked at the case and decided that it was a runner; the adjudicating panel would have done so as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point as regards the existing rules. Any solicitor has the ability to determine whether a case should receive the support of legal aid. For it to proceed, it is, I accept, necessary for a member of the Bar to support that view. That is inherent in the difficulty. If I may continue with my statistics, I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman of my case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the 3,261 law firms that claimed legal aid for clinical negligence cases in 1996–97, 2,844 did fewer man five cases. A relatively small number of highly specialised firms therefore provide a great deal of help, which—the statistics suggest—is very helpful. A large number of firms do very few cases, fairly poorly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's statistical case shows that a large number of firms do fewer man five cases. That presumably refers to them starting or finishing fewer than five cases—there must be something by which they are measured. I will not say that the Minister chided me, but he said that my argument about adjudication on the merits test stood up only under the existing regime—in other words, my argument could run only under the existing regime. His statistics are, however, garnered from the same period and the same regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that. That is why it is necessary to improve those statistics through the changes that we propose. The success rate for all cases was 28 per cent, for panel members, 18 per cent, for those who had a personal injury franchise, and only 17 per cent, for non-panel-members. Average damages recovered were £48,500 for panel members—for specialist lawyers—and £18,000 on average for those who were not members of the panel. There is a significant difference between the result for clients who go to those with specialist knowledge and experience and the result for those who simply go to a general firm of solicitors with no such specialist knowledge and experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has no resistance at all on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Preston put it extremely well. It is important that we protect those clients from lawyers who do not have the necessary expertise to conduct such cases effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard statistics used casually before, but this strikes me as extraordinary. I wonder how the comparative statistics would stand up, for instance, if one compared the volume and amount of damages awarded to cases in which the plaintiff was represented by a Queen's Counsel with the damages awarded in cases in which the plaintiff was represented by an ordinary member of the Bar. Surely that would demonstrate that a Queen's Counsel would usually get much higher damages—but then, of course, his fees would be much higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to spare the Committee one further set of statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go on!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman prompts me. As the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) observes, employing a Queen's Counsel would cost more money. For every pound of taxpayers' money spent in this area, panel members produce some £4.10 in damages. Those who are not members of the specialist panel produce only £1.70 in damages. So for every pound that the taxpayer spends on those who are not expert or specialist in this field, only £1.70 is achieved in return. There begins to be an argument, if such statistics prevail, for simply handing over the money to the victims in the first place and not worrying about the process of going to court and going through the complex procedures involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the more detailed points raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. First, he spoke about qualifications. The qualification for the Law Society panel is based on experience sufficient to persuade the assessors appointed by the Law Society. However, the hon. Gentleman will know from his experience of the profession that they guard very jealously the status of specialists, and the specialist panels—so far, at any rate—have been rigorous in determining the qualifications of who may join. We are content for the moment to leave that determination in the hands of the specialist panel organised by the Law Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Membership is based on evidence of cases undertaken or assisted by the AVMA panel. Again, its members have a clear interest in ensuring that clients referred by them to lawyers are referred only to those who are competent to do the work. That reflects on their own integrity an on the integrity of that organisation. Once again, we are content, for the moment, to rely on their judgment in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to grandfathering, the firm will hold the franchise. The franchise supervisor will be a member of the firm on the panel and that means, most importantly, that new lawyers can learn in the firm under the tutelage of the panel member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for the board to monitor the situation. I confirm to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon that the changes will not affect existing legal aid certificates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for members of the Bar, we are content to rely on the fact that specialist competent solicitors will employ only specialist competent barristers to undertake the case. If they are receiving legal aid on the basis that they are specialists, and are members of panels, they are hardly likely to compromise their integrity by employing a barrister who is not similarly specialist in the field. The Bar has supported these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have already dealt with the point about panel membership and qualifications resting with the Lord Chancellor. I hope that it is inherent in what I have just said—it will be for AVMA and the Law Society to determine membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon concerned delegation to inexperienced junior staff. Franchise requirements will impose stringent supervision requirements on the firm in order for it to retain its franchise. If there were evidence or sustained complaints that a firm was delegating work to inexperienced junior members, that matter would have to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
be looked at by the Legal Aid Board to see whether the firm was entitled to maintain its position as a franchise member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measurement of outcome is a good modern pursuit. Clearly, deciding whether it is necessary to reconsider somebody's position on the panel will involve an element of measurement of outcome. Such reconsideration may be thought necessary if a person continually obtains bad results. However, that would involve only a measurement of result ex post facto—after the damage had been done and after the client had not been looked after well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reflect on that point? I do not require an answer today. Will any attempt be made at mid-case monitoring? Will anybody go and look at some of the cases in question? Will the solicitor's file be reviewed at any time? Would it be appropriate to put an observer in the back of a court during a major or significant trial?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consider the matter for the future. I am sure that the hon. Member for Solihull will ask similar questions when we debate the Access to Justice Bill in the House. Such arguments are inherent in the type of changes that the Government are making. We are proposing contracts in general with lawyers who specialise in fields other than clinical negligence. Many organisations already ensure that they have access to the work in progress of the firms that they employ. For example, some insurance companies employ panels of solicitors that use electronic means to monitor work in progress, Nowadays, trade unions also use such monitoring to ensure that their clients are getting the best possible service from the lawyers. If trade unions and insurance companies can do mat, I see no reason why the Legal Aid Board should not similarly supervise the way in which work is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Preston for her remarks. Too often when debating legal matters in Committee, lawyers comment on the implications for lawyers of the proposals under consideration. My hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Friend was able to comment effectively from the clients' point of view, it is incumbent upon lawyers not to forget that they are there to serve the public rather than their own specific professional interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I ever fail to understand the hon. Member for Solihull, it is entirely my failing. Sometimes the problem is that he is extremely good at answering his own questions before he gives me the opportunity to do so. He referred to the fundamental principle of unfettered choice, but then said how important it was for a client to be better protected by having a more restricted choice, which is the answer that I might have given if he had left his question unanswered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment of Law Society rules is clearly a matter for the Law Society. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Committee is discussing legal aid, and not necessarily a solicitor's general right to offer his or her services to the public. We are discussing the terms on which such a solicitor will be granted taxpayers' money to conduct a case. The regulations will not necessarily affect the Law Society—any change is a matter for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
