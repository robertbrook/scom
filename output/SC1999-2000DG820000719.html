	<div class='legislation'>Draft Scotland Act 1998 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2000</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Scotland Act 1998 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2000.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. The draft order is made under section 105 of the Scotland Act 1998. As some of us are already too well aware, it is the third order of its kind: two extensive orders were made under that power last year, ahead of devolution. Section 105 enables existing enactments or instruments to be amended as necessary in consequence of the Scotland Act. Given the wide implications of devolution, it was impractical to make provision at the time for every modification of every enactment necessary as a result of that Act. Section 105 enables further modifications to be made as the need arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order deals with all the examples identified over the past year in which a consequential modification is necessary. In some cases, it has simply been a matter of realising that a power that may have to be exercised at some point in the future has not been adapted to work properly when devolved to Scottish Ministers. In one or two cases, the need to exercise a power has been identified and the provisions under the order are intended to enable devolved powers to be exercised or exercised more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at this juncture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also examples where the purpose is to include statutory bodies set up by Acts of the Scottish Parliament within the effects of United Kingdom legislation, for example, on disability discrimination. I may as well give way now to the hon. Gentleman—it will save trouble later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is perceptive. Does the fact that modifications are needed demonstrate that the original legislation was drafted hastily and incorrectly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously a matter for the Committee to judge, but on the basis of what I have said so far, it would be unreasonable to adduce that conclusion. Everyone recognises that devolution legislation was an extremely major and complex constitutional change and the idea that there would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
no tidying up afterwards belongs in the world of fantasy, which doubtless is why the hon. Gentleman raises the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, another explanation is that the legislation was scrutinised inadequately by the Opposition during the passage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. I wish that I had thought of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several entries relate to the procedure in the Scottish Parliament for devolved secondary legislation subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, especially when the statute requires approval to be obtained within a certain number of days. As matters stand, before the draft order is passed, mainly as a result of different terminology between the Scottish Parliament and Westminster, there are cases when the period allowed for parliamentary scrutiny continues during the parliamentary recess. That means that an order can fall because the Scottish Parliament has not been sitting to pass the required affirmative resolutions. The draft order puts the Scottish parliamentary procedure on a similar basis to that obtaining here, in that the clock marking the period within which affirmative resolutions are required will stop ticking in the recess—quite poetic, do hon. Members not think?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another entry relating to subordinate legislation procedure is that for the Human Rights Act 1998, section 10 of which provides for Ministers to make remedial orders where statutory provisions are found to be incompatible with the European convention on human rights. It will be possible for such orders to be made in relation to devolved matters by Scottish Ministers. Schedule 2 of the Human Rights Act regulates the parliamentary procedure for those orders. The procedure is more complex than the usual statutory instrument procedure, and section 118 of the Scotland Act 1998 does not do all that is necessary to translate the parliamentary procedure for those orders so that it operates correctly in the Scottish Parliament. A similar procedure for deregulation orders in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 was amended by an earlier order under section 105.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another group of entries in the draft order extends references to the term "enactment", so that they include references to Acts of the Scottish Parliament, where necessary. The general rule is that references to "enactment" in Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament do not include Acts, or instruments made under Acts, of the Scottish Parliament. However, it is sometimes desirable for references to "enactment" to include Acts of the Scottish Parliament, so that the UK Parliament's Act operates properly. Amendments of that type have been made to the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to go into the detail of each entry in the draft order, as there are 23 paragraphs in the schedule. However, if hon. Members have questions on any entry, I shall be happy to assist. I hope that hon. Members will have no difficulty in supporting the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
order, which is aimed solely at the effective operation in Scotland of pre-existing UK Parliament legislation following devolution. I can assure hon. Members that the order contains no hidden traps or matters of substance disguised as mere tidying-up; it is exactly as it appears. However, as always, I expect the Committee's scrutiny to test that assertion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dominic Grieve 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope not to take up too much of the Committee's time. When contemplating at the outset the brevity of article 3:
	<br><blockquote><p>Nothing in this Order prejudices the general operation of the modifications in sections 117 to 122 of the Scotland Act 1998</p></blockquote>
I was minded to point out gently to the Minister the contents of the explanatory note, which are worth reading in their entirety. The note states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Article 3 contains a saving provision which ensures that, in interpreting enactments which have not been textually amended because reliance is placed on the general modifications in the Act no adverse implication can be drawn because of the presence in the Schedule of textual amendments to some enactments which replicate the effect of the general modifications.</p></blockquote>
The quality of explanatory notes continues to be a cause of concern to this and doubtless many other Committees. As those notes come from the Scotland Office, will the Minister in future provide notes along the lines of those provided by the Scottish Parliament, which enabled members of the Committee to understand in brief what the article is about? I do not find the above explanatory note helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most matters in the body of the text seem completely innocuous, and I trust the Minister's judgment on such matters, which may be an unusual thing for an Opposition Member to say. Having considered the order, I can see no reason why the Committee should not pass it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek further clarification only on the scope of paragraph 21, relating to the Human Rights Act 1998. Will that paragraph give Ministers of the Scottish Executive powers similar to those held by Ministers in the UK Government in relation to primary as opposed to secondary legislation? If a Scottish court or, ultimately, the House of Lords decides that a piece of legislation offends the Human Rights Act 1998, will the Scottish Parliament and a Minister, through that Parliament, be allowed to enact a similar short debate and pass an order to quash the offending section? I assume that that is the intention, but the text is difficult to follow with complete accuracy. I should be grateful if the Minister clarified that we are referring to that rather than to a power for secondary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As so often in encounters with the Minister, I echo the need for better explanatory notes. The issue has not been debated in the Scottish Parliament, so we cannot look there for further guidance, but it was raised in another place earlier this week and the same point about explanatory notes was made there. The Minister assures us that there are no hidden elephant traps and that other legislation will not be subject to dangerous amendments. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
explanatory notes had provided more information, hon. Members would have had time to establish for themselves whether the Minister's intentions were genuinely only to tidy up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was less shocked than the other Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), to hear that the Minister asked the House of Commons Library whether anything controversial could be hidden in the proposals. I thank the Library for its scrutiny. So far, nothing controversial can be spotted but, as they say, you never know. I, too, want to highlight human rights legislation and would be grateful for further guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution is an evolving process and tidying-up will be necessary. The lack or otherwise of scrutiny of the original Scotland Act will not stop various problems coming to light from time to time. With hindsight, it would have been better if the non-controversial aspects of the Scotland Act had been debated in Committee and the controversial aspects on the Floor of the House, as that would have provided better scrutiny of the more complicated bits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give an assurance that after the recess—or perhaps after the Queen's Speech, to provide even more time—a new style of explanatory notes will be forthcoming? That would be most welcome. For now, we have to take it on trust that he and the Library have done their work carefully and that nothing too dangerous or controversial is contained in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Due to my absences in the Scottish Parliament, I have been unable to serve in Committee for some months and I had forgotten just how exciting they could be. The Minister's speech was no surprise, given that it was—but for the substitution of "hon. Members" for "noble Lords" and the intervention of the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant)—word for word the same as that given by Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale in another place on Monday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make precisely the same point about the so-called "explanatory" notes that was made by the other two Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen. In fact, they complicate rather than explain the order and they compare unfavourably with the explanatory notes issued for statutory instruments in the Scottish Parliament, which are subject to scrutiny by two committees—the statutory instrument committee and the subject committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a point of principle, hon. Members should be provided with fuller explanation. In most cases, because the vast majority of instruments are non-controversial, that would be enough, but occasionally, as in the adjacent waters debate, the implementation of statutory instruments can subsequently lead to parliamentary controversy, and it is preferable that controversy be picked up earlier. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee must be crystal clear about what they take note of at the end of proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to be called to make a brief speech. I well understand the need for this consequential modifications order. There were two such orders last year and the draft order before us is the first this year. However assiduous are Committees in their scrutiny of legislation, typographical or technical mistakes can be made or overlooked. Will the Minister confirm that other such mistakes may yet be found, which would need a further consequential modifications order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to article 20 of part I of the schedule and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. I note that it refers to a special parliamentary procedure order 1999; will more consequential modifications orders therefore be needed because of measures yet to be enacted? Whatever the Scottish or the United Kingdom Parliaments do, a change in legislation that will have an impact on Scotland may be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.44 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Committee for the reasonable way in which it has considered the order. That reasonableness is justified; if there had been issues of greater significance in the measure, I would have drawn them to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge the contribution of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman); we have a moving script and measures enacted by the devolved Administration or in Westminster have the potential to make a consequential impact on the legislation in the other institution. We—in the broadest sense—will return to the matter, and Members of the UK Parliament will, from time to time, update and amend the technicalities and anomalies. That point is well-taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked about the Human Rights Act 1998 and the scope of article 21. I assure him that it does not change the Scottish Parliament's powers in that respect. The Scottish Parliament, like this Parliament, can have short debates to quash offending clauses. There is nothing new about the proposal; it merely tidies things up and gives the power to act clearly and in a proper, legislative way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition spokesmen mentioned the notes; it is difficult to argue with them, especially as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield read out such a shining example of an unsuccessful application for the plain English award. However, there is a difference between what happens in Committees in this House and in the Scottish Parliament. In this House, explanatory notes are purely technical explanations of what the legislation is about, which should be in plain English. They are not meant to be expositions on the policy issues to which they refer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way in a moment. Committees in the Scottish Parliament are, properly, different from those in this House. The Parliaments are
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
separate, and operate under different rules and procedure. Committees in the Scottish Parliament examining these measures would have a much more discursive function in terms of policy implications. Members would be given, not explanatory notes, but executive notes, similar to my briefings as a Minister albeit not necessarily technical explanations of what the amendments or enactments are meant to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to both hon. Gentlemen in a moment. A genuine issue has been raised that is relevant to the Committee and to the House. We all know that explanatory notes in Committees sometimes do not explain very much. That contrasts with the different way in which things are done elsewhere, which is a matter not for the Government, but for the authorities of the House. However, I am willing to draw hon. Members' comments about the workings of this Committee and its successors to the attention of the appropriate authorities, as part of a more general point on whether members of Standing Committees and statutory instrument Committees should have more political background information to the measures that they are examining. That is a legitimate question to ask and I shall write to hon. Members after I have received a response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have already answered the point that I was about to make about whether we prefer executive notes or explanatory notes. We agree that the minimum required is explanatory notes that explain, rather than make matters more opaque, as the notes do in this instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister had moved on, but I was about to welcome what he proposes to do. It will be a starting point. Perhaps we should join him in making similar representations through other channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to add controversy here. However, while I am delighted that the Minister is to raise this matter with the House authorities, does he not accept that explanatory notes are drawn up by the Government Department responsible for the Bills and statutory instruments involved? The Minister was right to say that explanatory notes are meant to explain, not confuse. Perhaps he will also address his own Department with regard to his explanatory notes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two points are interrelated. The question of who writes the text is secondary to the question of the format within which the explanatory notes are expected to work and where tradition

applies. If there is to be a change, it is a matter for the House rather than the Government, because, as I should have made clear, the legislative drafting officer is responsible for the explanatory notes. I will, as promised, write to all hon. Members about taking the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
