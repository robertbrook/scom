	<div class='legislation'>Draft Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts in Rear Seats by Adults) Regulations 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Roads and Traffic (Mr. Christopher Chope)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, the Committee has considered the Draft Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts in Rear Seats by Adults) Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first time that I have had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that so many people are present shows the interest in the subject. It does not suggest that it is still a controversial subject, although it is important for road safety. The matter was debated at length last autumn, when we had a whole day's road safety debate in the House. The Government stole the Opposition's thunder by announcing, during the debate, that we would bring regulations before the House to make the wearing of rear seat belts by adults compulsory from 1 July 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation on the regulations showed clearly that they had much popular support. They will prevent an estimated 100 deaths and 1,000 serious injuries every year. I must tell the few people concerned about the aspect of civil liberties that I have seen the video produced by the transport and road research laboratory, which demonstrates what happens when someone who is unrestrained in the rear seat of a car is involved in a collision: the person is projected forward and can cause great injury to the driver or the passenger in the front seat. The rear-seat passenger may not care about his or her own safety, but by not wearing a seat belt he or she jeopardises other people in the car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it necessary to deploy all the arguments in favour of the legislation. It was not possible to introduce it until most vehicles had been fitted with rear seat belts. More than 60 per cent. of vehicles are now thus equipped and that means that at least 60 per cent. of vehicles will carry rear adult passengers wearing seat belts. Owners of vehicles manufactured between 1983 and 1987 can have rear seat belts fitted because anchorages for rear belts have compulsorily been incorporated in cars since 1983. The well known company Kwik-Fit—Euro Ltd, which has done much to promote road safety, is inviting people who have such anchorages in their cars to have rear belts fitted. That promotion will increase the impact of the regulations. I hope that the Committee will support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.33 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Ruddock 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, Deptford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome yoto the Chair, Mr. Hill, on this beautiful.
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
afternoon. We shall not detain the Committee for long because, as the Minister said, the Opposition are strongly in favour of the measure. We had planned, on the occasion to which the Minister referred, to press the Government to introduce such a measure. We were therefore delighted that the Government themselves undertook to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still concerned, as are the British safety organisations—especially the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety—that although 60 per cent. of vehicles have rear seat belts, surveys show that only 11 per cent. of adults travelling in such vehicles make use of them. That is why the Government must take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1988 figures, 300 deaths and 4,000 serious injuries occurred among people sitting in rear seats, none of whom were using restraints. So the potential for preventing injury and death is considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister examine the fact that his predecessor gave different figures a year ago about the potential for saving life when he estimated that 200 deaths and 9,000 injuries could have been prevented? Those figures have now been scaled down in the Department's press releases to 100 deaths and 1,000 serious injuries. This is not a party-political point, but it would be useful to have clarification of what we might expect, because once the legislation is in place and, as we hope, people follow the guidance and belt up in back seats, we will want to measure the effects against the anticipated prevention of damage to people travelling in those seats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has the Minister chosen not to introduce measures to restrain people travelling in minibuses? Minibuses and coaches are a continuing cause of concern because of the lack of seat belt restraints other than those on seats in front of which there is no seat. We believe that the same principles apply, and that people ejected from a seat during an accident can damage the persons in front— they certainly damage themselves. Although the safety record of coaches and minibuses is better than that of cars, the Government should introduce the same measures for the former.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister believes as strongly as we do that it is necessary to restrain people so that if there is a collision the damage to their bodies is minimised, why is he, according to press reports, considering raising the speed limit to 90 miles an hour? I shall be glad if he will deny that. As research shows that collisions taking place at a higher speed would increase the likelihood of serious injury and death, the measure of restraint on rear-seat passengers might quickly be offset by the fact that accidents might occur at even higher speeds and above the speed limit, as they do now. I hope that the Minister will take that remark in the spirit in which it was intended, because the Government and the Opposition are united in trying to raise road safety standards in Britain. I commend the Minister's introduction of this necessary measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the measure, but will the Minister clarify the position of the Government and of the European Commission on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the requirement to bring in regulations for minibuses by the end of 1991?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.39 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse all the regulations before us today. They come into being not before time. In the context of exemptions, and a disabled person wearing a disabled person's belt, who is to say what such a belt is? Manufacturers make many different designs. Do Ministers decide what a disabled person's belt is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixty per cent. of motor cars have rear seat belts at the moment. The Minister said that from 1983 onwards there have been fittings that will take these belts. Many cars manufactured before then, however, do not have them. How much time will owners of these cars be given to comply with the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a couple of points as co-chairman of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council is delighted that the Minister has introduced the regulations so quickly. PACTS would like to think that this had had much to do with its efforts in campaigning on seat belt legislation for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal had wide public support. PACTS commissioned a Gallup survey, with the help of the RAC, in February 1990. At the time, 82 per cent. of the public supported the proposals. The measure will therefore be broadly acceptable to the public-selfenforcement being a vital element in its enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are a considerable contribution to the Government's efforts to meet their casualty reduction targets. PACTS thinks that a greater contribution would have been a change in the Government's random breath-testing. The regulations will contribute to the overall reduction of casualties, although we have genuine doubts about whether we shall reach the target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must acknowledge the efforts of Tom Farmer of Kwik-Fit, who is organising a television advertising campaign. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what the Department of Transport intends to do about publicity, and how much it will spend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Farmer is making his individual effort to promote the campaign. Will he press the Government to help?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only Mr. Farmer can answer that. I agree that he has made a major contribution. PACTS feels, as I do, that there has to be publicity, wherever it comes from, because unless the public are aware of the change in the law it will not have the significant effect that it should have. Publicity is a vital element. It should not be left to public-spirited individuals such as Mr. Farmer. I hope that the Department of Transport will come up with a positive plan to publicise these superb regulations because, if they are to work, the public must know about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 pm</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) on the notable part that he played in promoting the regulations. This must be as welcome a day for him as it is for me and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us are even more delighted at reaching this most important moment, bearing in mind that our fight for compulsory seat belt legislation goes back to the early 1970s, since when we have fought Labour and Conservative Governments alike. It seemed extraordinarily difficult to gain acceptance of the principle of compulsion. No one likes compulsion, and there was general opposition on all sides to the restriction of freedom that goes with compulsory seat belts. Time and again, statistics have shown the overwhelming need for legislation, and the results have demonstrated how right people were to fight for compulsion. I am sure that we shall achieve the same satisfactory results from the compulsory wearing of rear seat belts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legislation alone is not what matters; the public will accept it, but they must be made aware of it. I hope that the Department of Transport will mount a forceful campaign to advertise the regulations so that the public are made fully aware of the law, which I am sure they are not now. I hope that the Minister will tell us about the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with others that the campaign will have been concluded satisfactorily only when the wearing of seat belts in minibuses and coaches is made compulsory. If it is not, there will be further tragedies on the roads and more pressure for the compulsory wearing of seat belts. How much better to act now before fatalities occur. I very much welcome this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the point made by the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) about people with disabilities who travel in minibuses equipped for the handicapped. A constituent of mine has a daughter with a severe disability. We entered into correspondence with the Isle of Wight district health authority to find out what would be a suitable restraining apparatus for her in a minibus. We sought the advice for her consultant from the Southampton general hospital. We experienced considerable difficulty in finding something suitable that would not increase the danger of further injury to her and which was acceptable to the district health authority. That correspondence continued for many months during which I found it difficult to obtain definitive advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will talk about that specialised area when he sums up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms. Ruddock) mentioned the estimates of casualties, and was kind enough to show me the answer to a Parliamentary question given by my predecessor about 18 months ago. I surmise that that answer was based upon what would happen if everybody in the rear seat of a car was wearing a seat belt. The estimates that we are giving today are based
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
upon what will happen in the foreseeable future bearing in mind the number of people who will be travelling in cars with rear seat belts already fitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) asked how long people will have in which to fit seat belts. The answer is: as long as they wish. We have no intention of forcing people to fit rear seat belts in cars with no anchorages. Obviously it is not possible to specify safe anchorage points when they have not been incorporated in a car at the time of its manufacture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members mentioned minibuses and coaches, about which I know that there is continuing concern. The problem is that under the terms of the relevant European Community directives, no manufacturer can be obliged to fit seat belts or anchorages except to front seats and all exposed forward-facing seats in coaches and minibuses. The Government will continue to press the European Commission to introduce proposals as soon as possible to require seat belts to be fitted on all seats in coaches and minibuses. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Until we are successful in that campaign, we cannot require people to wear seat belts because they do not even have to be fitted to these vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the support in Committee for the Government to continue to press that point with our partners in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be a little more forthcoming on that point, as it has been raised by so many of us? Will the Minister tell us what the stumbling blocks in Europe are, when he next expects to have a meeting and how this point will be pursued?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say exactly when the matter will next be raised, but I can confirm that we are being persistent in trying to get the European Commission to take action. It is particularly frustrating because the Commission is slow to act on a point on which it is clear that only the Commission can take action. At the same time, it appears to be eager to interfere in other areas of activity when it is clear that member states already have the necessary powers to act in the interests of road safety. However, the Government are doing all that they can to build alliances with other partners in Europe to try to put additional pressure on the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point was made about the speed limit on roads. As I said at the time of the reports, it was fantasy to suggest that the Government were thinking of raising the speed limit from 70 to 90 miles an hour. Only one newspaper persisted with its story when confronted with such denials. That newspaper has not stopped printing letters—including one from the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford—based on total falsehood. I shall repeat as often as necessary that the Government have no intention of raising the speed limit on motorways from 70 to 90 miles an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still reacting slowly to the Minister's point about the European Community. Is he saying that the United Kingdom cannot insist on
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
seat belt wearing in public transport vehicles such as coaches and minibuses even for travel in our own country? I can understand the desirability of having regulations on a Europe-wide basis. I can also understand that we shall need Commission regulations if we are to achieve that. But is he really saying that we cannot insist on this on British roads?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that we cannot require coaches to be fitted with seat belt anchorages. What we can do is try to persuade coach manufacturers to fit them. That is precisely what we are doing. It may be frustrating for some colleagues to note that when it comes to setting European standards for the construction of motor vehicles, the European Commission tends to dictate the terms—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's written answer to a parliamentary question on 12 December 1990 suggested that decisions had been taken, and that the European Community was committed to advancing proposals for minibuses before the end of 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For minibuses, not coaches. We may debate the proposals on minibuses, but we have still not seen them. I hope that by the end of 1991, proposed changes will actually take place. As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) knows, announcements are made by the European Commission about when amendments will be drafted for discussion, but I shall not make any assertions until the drafts are finally produced for our consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to seek the Minister's clarification on whether it is impossible to legislate for seat belts on coaches; and on whether it is possible for Britain to act on minibuses in the interim. Will the Minister clarify further whether there is a difference between the two?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister seen the minibus safety charter produced by the Community Transport Association? If the Minister is unable to legislate, has he any plans to introduce guidance and examples of best practice in the use of seat belt restraint in minibuses? There needs to be an important public campaign about that, especially because minibuses are often used to transport people with disabilities, the elderly and children. The Government may be able to do something. Does the Minister have any intentions in that direction if he feels that he is making insufficient progress because the EC is standing in his way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady knows, there is a limit to what the Government can do. We can encourage users of minibuses to tell operators that they would prefer to travel with seat belts fitted. That is how a consumer can pressurise a provider of a service to comply with what the consumer wants. I have written to correspondents to say that they should not just wring their hands about the absence of seat belts but demand to have them fitted. However, such fitting has to be done on a voluntary basis.

that Parliament gives to regulations, which I do not wish to anticipate. However, the Government have plans for an advertising campaign—costing about £1 million—to be launched at the beginning of June to bring home the message that from 1 July it will be compulsory to wear rear seat belts when they are fitted. It will complement other campaigns, particularly that of Kwit-Fit, which was mentioned earlier.

The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) and my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) discussed the disabled person's belt. If any prosecutions are brought, decisions about whether a person was disabled or—whether the best that he was wearing was a disabled person's belt will be questions

of fact in court. The disabled person's belt is defined in regulation 47 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986.
