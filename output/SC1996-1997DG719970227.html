	<div class='legislation'>Draft Education (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Michael Ancram)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Education (No. 2) (Norhern Ireland) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The order, which was laid before the House on 3 December 1996, is basically an enabling order. Part II provides for the introduction to Northern Ireland of a grant scheme for the education of children below compulsory school age. Royal Assent has been given to corresponding legislation for England, Wales and Scotland, and that will come into effect in April 1997. Unfortunately, plans to introduce the scheme in Northern Ireland in September have had to be postponed to maintain and protect mainstream school and other education priorities. The Government remain committed to the scheme and it is important that legislative provision should be made for parents and children in Northern Ireland to participate in the scheme as soon as the necessary financial resources can be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order's provisions are enabling powers under which the administrative and inspection arrangements for the scheme can be established in due course. I will outline the main purpose of those powers briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under article 3, the Department of Education for Northern Ireland will be able to make grants for preschool education. Eligibility for vouchers under the scheme will be determined by the date of the child's fourth birthday. The amount and frequency of the grant payment will be determined by the Department in line with the national level of grant for those entitled to a voucher for a full year. The order will also enable the Department to specify standards that providers must meet, including on accommodation, staffing ratios, staff qualifications and curriculum. Providers will be inspected by the education and training inspectorate to ensure that they are suitable for registration under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will also allow the Department to delegate arrangements for the issue and redemption of vouchers to the Voucher Company, which will be employed by the UK Department for Education and Employment for this purpose. The Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland will be able to provide social security information to enable eligible children to be identified and their families contacted about participation. These arrangements are
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
necessary to ensure that the benefits of the national scheme will be available to the children of Northern Ireland when the necessary resources can be secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III consists of provisions relating to the admission of children to grant-aided schools in Northern Ireland. That is basically a revision of existing provisions in part IV of the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. It contains no underlying change in open enrolment policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the new provisions is to rectify ambiguities in existing open enrolment legislation and thus to clarify and strengthen existing law. The new provisions will clarify the parental preferences constrained by the physical capacity of schools and make it clear that schools should, other than in specified circumstances, admit pupils up to the limit of their enrolment numbers. They will also prohibit schools from using the order of preference expressed by parents as part of their admissions criteria. That will be fairer to parents and will complement the new transport arrangements introduced for 1997–98, which limit transport assistance to pupils who are unable to gain a place in a suitable school within statutory walking distance of their home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs: 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How frequently is there a revision of the enrolment numbers, particularly in primary schools, to take account of population growth in particular areas and of the fact that overgenerous provision appears to be made in some areas, enabling children in various parts of the Province, with rather low scores in the transfer procedure, to obtain grammar school places? That gives an impression of discrimination in certain areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be corrected if I am wrong, but usually the enrolment and capacity figures are examined annually, though they rarely change, for obvious reasons. Schools tend to be tied, to a great extent, by their physical capacity, and the enrolment figures for each year are worked out on the basis of a school's total capacity. As to grammar school places, the fact that there are not too many of those is very much a part of the selective system. The point of selection is to try to ensure that a limited number of places is available for those children who achieve a particular level in the transfer tests. Therefore, we scrutinise closely any suggestions for more grammar school places. Where they are justified—a strong case has been made in Londonderry in the past few years, for instance—we allow for expansion. We also consider numbers at the request of schools, which is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 23 provides a revision of article 52 of the 1986 order, which deals with transport assistance. The proposals would enable the Department of Education to take the lead in determining the transport arrangements that are considered necessary to facilitate pupils' attendance at grant-aided schools and that of relevant students at institutes of further education. Such transport would continue to be provided free of charge for those pupils and students eligible for transport assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that this is a question of saving money on school transport and I should be interested to know how much the Minister anticipates saving as a consequence of what he has outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment will not create the saving. To a great extent, savings are being achieved already, through changes that did not require statutory provision. I shall discuss those. We estimate those changes to have produced savings of about £3 million a year. The provision that I have been describing allows charges to be made for children who are over compulsory school age. It is an enabling provision and the amount saved will depend on the level and extent of charges, which it does not specify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment enables the boards, in accordance with arrangements approved by the Department of Education, to provide transport assistance for those pupils at grant-aided schools and relevant students attending institutions of further education for whom transport is not considered necessary—that will be the test. In those circumstances, the new article provides for boards to charge for any transport that is provided and for charges to be remitted in certain circumstances. The possible need to introduce such a charge arises because of an escalation in transport costs, to which the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), referred. They have increased from about £23 million in the early 1990s to a figure approaching £38 million at present. Those figures are considerable, as I am sure the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) will understand, in the context of the savings that must be made. We calculate that if the present trend continues, charges could increase to £40 million by 1998–99. Such expense diverts badly needed finance from the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already taken action to contain expenditure, but it may be necessary to do more, which is the reason for the enabling provision. It will give us the option of introducing charges for transport in certain circumstances, should it be judged necessary for protecting classroom provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way yet again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does he concede that the explosion in transport costs is not a result of the decisions of area boards in Northern Ireland, but of a change of policy by one of his predecessors? Consequently, the cost of transport has almost got out of hand. Has any attempt been made across the Province to ensure that all schools in a given area have the same holiday arrangements so that savings are made by not running half-empty buses and not opening canteens in one or two schools? Getting all school principals to agree even in small towns is difficult, but uniform holiday arrangements could lead to substantial savings in transport costs. Thus more money could go directly to education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. In the consultation paper on school transport, I proposed charging those over 16. For the reasons that the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
outlined, we asked the boards what savings could be made by co-ordinating holiday arrangements. The hon. Gentleman is right; savings could be made in that way. Therefore, the pressure does not yet exist to require those over 16 to be charged. However, I am waiting for the boards to tell me the exact savings that could be made through the co-ordination of holidays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Antrim was also right when he claimed that the problem arose from the policy of open enrolment that one of my predecessors introduced. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that parental choice and open enrolment are good policies. Open enrolment entails a cost wherever it is implemented and we must consider how to balance the cost. In Northern Ireland, school transport provision was more generous than in my constituency in Wiltshire. I have presented provisions that are in line with regulations that apply to England and Wales. The nearest appropriate school is the criterion by which the need for free transport is to be judged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the Government believe that free transport will always be necessary for pupils of compulsory school age who are unable to gain a place in a suitable school within statutory walking distance of their homes. Those pupils would not be asked to pay for transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 23 makes minor consequential amendments to schedule 13 of the 1986 order and articles 130 and 137 of the 1989 order. Those amendments do not make any substantive change to the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 25 introduces some technical amendments to education legislation to remove some impediments to one type of contract, which may be appropriate under the private finance initiative. Previous powers were drafted at a time when such contracts were not envisaged, and some adjustments are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PFI may apply in a variety of ways in the education sector, but one particular possibility is being explored. It is the provision of school accommodation under a contract whereby the private sector would design, build, finance, operate and maintain the school premises and provide a variety of associated services. In theory, that could include all aspects except teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing powers for voluntary maintained schools need to be adjusted because they prescribe that the education and library boards must provide some of those services for those schools. They also prescribe separate funding mechanisms for recurrent and capital grant for voluntary maintained and voluntary grammar schools which would be difficult to apply in respect of a private finance initiative contract. No changes are needed in existing powers to facilitate PFI contracts for controlled schools or further education colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress that the powers will come into operation only if and when a contract is agreed between the relevant contracting authority and the individual school and is approved by the Department. That will arise only if the contract is affordable and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
represents good value for money and if it incorporates the important principles of risk transfer that are central to the private finance initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contract might embrace one, several or a larger number of schools, and the provision on the alteration of school premises could include projects that address a specific aspect of a school's need, such as a heating system. The definition introduced in the proposed article is not intended to be restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the private finance initiative apply to nursery school provision? Undoubtedly, there is under-provision for that in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us whether there has been any consultation between his Department and the planning service to encourage those involved in dealing with applications for private pre-school provision to show a little more sympathy, support and flexibility so that sites for private pre-school provision can be approved reasonably quickly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman has a particular case in mind. It would be best if he wrote to me about it, so that I can look into the issue for him. The hon. Gentleman knows that I am keen to see preschool provision made. I regret that it has not been possible to introduce the voucher scheme this September, for the reasons I outlined earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes. A PH could be used for such provision, but that depends on the nature of the project and on attracting the right investment by creating interest among those likely to invest. We are running a number of pilot projects for secondary schools, and we have been encouraged into thinking that PH will work by the evidence from this side of the water. For example, we are closely studying a project in Dorset. It is early days for the PH, but theoretically the answer is yes: the PH could be used as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also knows that there are other ways in which we can support pre-school education. In particular, a number of applications have been made under the European funds for peace and reconciliation. Places are being provided as a result of that. I regret that we have been unable to use the voucher scheme, so I am keen to see other available resources used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described the main provisions of the order, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no objection to some aspects of the order. The proposal for admission of children to grant-aided schools is a sensible tidying-up measure and it removes an ambiguity. Similarly, the clarification of the law to allow a PH to operate is sensible. The Minister said it was still the early years for the PFI, but it has been Government policy for five years now. However, relatively little has happened in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
We have no objections to the proposals for school transport. However, the Minister should not skate over the scale of the problem. He quoted a rise from £23 million to £40 million in a relatively short time. We can allow for inflation, but we should think what else could have been done with that money. Because of costs elsewhere, £8 million is missing from the budget for nursery education. Instead of an increase from £23 million to £40 million, one could make available £16 million—double what is missing from the budget for nursery education—if the school transport system had not been altered by Government policy. The Government went through considerable trauma over the proposal to cut the number of school boards from five to three to save about £2 million. Yet, at the same time, the school transport bill has gone from £23 million to £40 million. That serious issue will have to be reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We object to the major part of the order, concerning nursery vouchers. The Minister has conceded that it is about vouchers, although one looks in vain for any mention of them in the order which seems, simply, to allow the Minister to give out money for the education of pre-school age children to anyone of whom he approves. The order is as bland and open as saying, "If we like you, we will give you money." Nothing will happen as a consequence of the order until the Minister decides to activate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall vote against the order because we know it refers to nursery vouchers and want to register opposition to that, as do many sections of society in Northern Ireland. Teachers, particularly those concerned with nursery education, are against it. Interestingly, pre-school playgroups are against vouchers, too. As well as all that, I believe that the Minister himself is against vouchers, along with his professional advisors. It was interesting that the Minister's introduction included nothing on why nursery vouchers would be good for Northern Ireland. He had an opportunity to proclaim their virtues, but he did not seem able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman accept that most of us in Northern Ireland would prefer additional money to be made available to the area boards so that our excellent, but limited, nursery schooling could be expanded? However, in the absence of that money—and no guarantee has been given today that there will be any additional funding—we reluctantly feel it better that additional money should come through a voucher scheme than that none should come at all to our nursery sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I take the hon. Gentleman's point. If £8 million had been in the Budget, we would have put it into expansion of nursery education in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been told to fall in line. Why, when vouchers are up and staggering in the rest of the United Kingdom, should we be considering them for Northern Ireland only at the fag end of a Parliament? Why has there been such delay if the Minister has not been conducting a rearguard action to fight off
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
vouchers? What obstacle was there to bringing them forward earlier?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Minister is not enthusiastic about vouchers. He put his name to a sensible document in September 1994, entitled "The Policy on Early Years Provision for Northern Ireland". The Minister signed that jointly with Baroness Denton, then Health Minister. That document was committed to extending nursery education. A mere nine months later, in July 1995, the Minister announced that he was to introduce a voucher scheme, contradicting what he had said before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That document was policy document, unlike the miserable charade contained in the order, which is not about policy, simply about administration, and offers no justification of why vouchers would be good for Northern Ireland. That policy document was about a framework, policy parameters, liaison and coordination and planning. But vouchers are about throwing away frameworks and strategic analysis, undermining the provision of the education and library boards and letting the market rule. I find it impossible to believe that the Minister can believe in both documents. One came out in September 1994 and the other in April 1996, following a statement from the Minister in July, 1995, and they are contradictory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy document talks about targeting social need and giving priority to those communities and children in greatest need. The voucher scheme runs against the principle of targeting social need. The principal value of the voucher scheme will be assist the well-off in subsidising their child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the key statement on page 9 of the 1994 document, the Minister says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Taking account of the introduction from 1990 of the lower age limit for compulsory schooling in Northern Ireland, the ultimate aim will be to provide one year of nursery education for all those under compulsory school age whose parents wish them to receive it."</p></blockquote>
That refers unambiguously to nursery education. When the Minister says that, he means the kind of provision that the hon. Member for East Antrim mentioned, namely building on the nursery classes that are run by the education and library boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A voucher can be used in a setting where at least half the staff must hold a relevant qualification in day care or education. There is no ambiguity about that. Those people who have become what I grew up to call nursery nurses would have a day-care qualification that would enable them to run that provision. Therefore, the voucher can be used in places where there are no qualified teachers, which must inevitably be a cheaper provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that the Minister would have produced this document if he knew that he would be forced to introduce the voucher scheme. The 1994 document cannot be the parent of the 1996 document. The voucher document simply fails to deal with the context of Northern Ireland. When it does, it gets it wrong. Let me try to explain how the voucher scheme will operate were it ever to come in. As I said, the Labour Government would not enact it.

In Northern Ireland, any child who reaches the age of four on or before 1 July in any year must start school in September. There is a difference here from the rest of the United Kingdom. If the child is born in July or August, he will receive three terms of vouchers. If the child is born in September, October, November or December, he will receive two terms of vouchers. If the child is born in January, February or March, he will receive one term of vouchers. A child born in April, May or June receives nothing at all. In other words, the youngest four-year-olds who are going to school in September will go there having received no voucher and no entitlement to nursery education and will have to compete against older four-year-olds who will have received up to a full year's provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we should look again at admitting children to primary schools in Northern Ireland at the age of four? He seems to be suggesting that if children need the same eductional background before entering primary school, those figures have to be adjusted. I am not clear what he is suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not questioning starting school at the age of four. But if children are to start school very young, the youngest of them are likely to need most assistance to cope with the first year of primary education. I may be mistaken, but the order appears to provide that the oldest four-year-olds will receive three terms' vouchers and the youngest four-year-olds who start school in September—will not receive any assistance whatever. That matters, because 11-plus results show that children born in the autumn tend to do better in the examination. The Minister has decided that the youngest four-year-olds, who will have the greatest struggle as they go through their primary education because they will compete against children who are almost a year older, will receive least assistance from the voucher scheme, while the oldest receive the most.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to understand what the hon. Gentleman means; if he is criticising us, no doubt he has suggestions to make. Either he is suggesting that these children should not go to school in the September after their fourth birthday or he thinks that they should receive pre-school training before the age of four. This scheme has been adopted specifically for four-year-olds. Will he clarify what he has in mind? It is easy to criticise, but it would be helpful to know what he would put in place of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am commenting on the fact that the aim of nursery education for the rest of the United Kingdom has been that children have a preschool year of nursery education, with a single entry. The idea of multiple entry dates for primary schools has been abandoned in most parts of the United Kingdom. With this provision for nursery vouchers the Government are reintroducing the idea of multiple entry dates, with some children receiving one term, others two terms, and yet others three terms; and the youngest, who start school in September, having nothing. Will the Minister confirm that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what is proposed because the scheme is for four-year-olds. I am asking the hon. Gentleman to give the Committee his suggestions, because I am sure that he accepts that if he criticises the Government the people of Northern Ireland will expect to hear his thoughts on the alternative that a Labour Government would choose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would propose what the Government propose. We would work towards providing one year of nursery education for all children under compulsory school age. The Government propose something radically different—that the youngest children, who are likely to have the greatest struggle when they start school as four-year-olds in September, be given no assistance whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the hon. Gentleman once more. I understood him to say that his Government would provide places for children under the age of four. Given that his Treasury colleagues have said that there will be no increase in expenditure, will he say how they will pay for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we had the £8 million, we would not introduce nursery vouchers but would extend nursery school provision on the basis of one year of nursery school provision targeting social need—putting those children first, and gradually building up provision. The Government have made a radical departure from that. They have said that, of the youngsters who begin school in September, the ones who will need most assistance because they are younger will receive no assistance whatever. The Minister must tell us why the Government chose that strange set of priorities to introduce nursery vouchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek other answers about the Government's intentions. Will the Minister confirm that the voucher scheme will have the same value, regardless of whether there are qualified staff and regardless of whether the standards of accommodation are those required to meet educational criteria, or those for child care? The answer is yes, it will. But is not that an intended downward push that will jeopardise quality? The people who provide the least-qualified staff and the worst buildings will make the most out of this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister clarify what is happening to the money associated with the provision? He said that he wanted the scheme to be launched this year, much later than in the rest of the United Kingdom, with £8.3 million of public money. The Government said that they have to switch priorities back to security because of their general budget difficulty and because of the disturbances last summer. The introduction of the voucher scheme is therefore postponed for a year. What has happened to the money? Has it all been taken away from pre-school education, or has some of it been retained to allow the development of nursery education? It would seem very savage to take any development money from nursery education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
In his introduction, the Minister talked about capital funds and mentioned provision in conjunction with the European Union. But the scheme was criticised because there was no provision for capital development to create more spaces—particularly in primary schools, which need to adapt surplus accommodation—or to make provision available in the schools in any other way. That lack of capital would not inhibit those in the private sector, who would calculate about the £1,100-worth of vouchers, the purchase of property and the need for adaptations, to see whether they could make a profit on the basis of their provision. It will, however, inhibit the public sector. There was some talk about capital from the European Union, which is what I believe that the Minister was referring to and I would welcome clarification in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is to happen to the administration of the scheme? I believe that the Minister signed a contract with Capita, an English-based company, for the administration of the voucher scheme for £300,000 over a three-year period. That was the framework of the agreement. Can the Minister assure us that no money has been spent on the contract and that an incoming Government will not have to pay cancellation fees or otherwise waste public money on a scheme that will not be enacted? We will not enact this proposal, but can the Government tell us what has been signed with Capita and say whether there is an easy way out of that contract? I believe that £300,000 could be used in a better way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall seek to expand nursery education and divert resources into it when we come into Government. We shall announce soon how we shall do so. The Government will have to wait to hear that announcement. Vouchers are not the way forward, for the reasons implied by the Government's own worthwhile policy document. Why did the Government completely ignore their own policy of targeting social need in going for vouchers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.8 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie mentioned the European money to which I referred. The peace package at present is £13 million for all pre-school provision and £4 million capital for nursery provision. I link that with the hon. Gentleman's references to the Government's commitment to provide one year of nursery education to all children under compulsory school age whose parents wish them to receive it. We retain that commitment; it will be achieved as resources permit. The hon. Gentleman must distinguish between creating those places and enabling parents who wish to use them to take them up, and enabling parents to secure a year of pre-school education for their children within the four-year-olds' scheme. The vouchers provide for the latter, other programmes for the former. Nursery places are bing provided not only through European funding. Since 1988, an additional 675 nursery places have been created through the Making Belfast Work and Londonderry initiatives. Government funding is provided to those areas through top-slicing. That includes moneys that would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
otherwise have been available within education. Money is provided to those projects to encourage further expansion through the programmes. That is right and proper. It is provided in those two places because Belfast and Londonderry have a higher than normal incidence of social deprivation. Additional places will be created under the EU peace package, which has provided a total of £17.5 million in capital and recurrent funding to develop early-years service in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked about the difficulties of children who have not received the same pre-school support as some older children when they enter primary 1. Primary 1 is an important part of a child's education. The basic foundation of future education is laid there. That is why we introduced the Making a Good Start scheme a year and a half ago, and provided money for an extra assistance place in each primary 1 class in Northern Ireland. The purpose of that assistance is to ensure that children who are not as advanced as others receive support to help them to make up the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not answering my main question about administration of the scheme. Why have the Government chosen a scheme that provides no assistance to the children who experience most difficulty in primary 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the scheme is for four-year-olds. the hon. Gentleman did not question that when I invited him to do so. He pointed out that eligibility for one term, two terms or three terms depends on the date of the child's birthday. For administrative purposes, a period of three months before the child becomes eligible is taken into account. As the hon. Gentleman said, those who are born between 1 April and 1 July will receive no entitlement voucher because they begin compulsory education when the voucher would have applied. They go to primary 1, where free compulsory education is available. Unless the hon. Gentleman suggests changing the system of admissions in Northern Ireland, he must accept the way in which the scheme will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that children who enter primary 1 receive the support required to make up for any deficiencies. The hon. Gentleman nodded in approval when I mentioned the Making a Good Start scheme. He cannot have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point, but if the Minister's goal was to provide a year of pre-school education for four-year-olds, the youngest would be swept up by the scheme. They are ignored by the scheme that the Minister proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing prevents younger children from being admitted to nursery education. We are trying to increase nursery places. The hon. Gentleman confuses two sorts of provision. Vouchers make parents eligible to decide where and how their children should be educated in the period before they enter primary 1 and after their fourth birthday. The hon. Gentleman suggested that I had no enthusiasm
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
for the scheme. However, I strongly supported it. Vouchers give parents a genuine choice. The Government aimed to achieve that and they are trying to ensure that the provision is as widespread as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of nursery school places, to which the Government are equally committed, is going ahead as resources permit. I have explained how the provision will operate. Places in the nursery school system are provided for parents who wish to take them up. Parents who want to use playgroups and other forms of pre-school education should have that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman claimed that the voucher system would be offered only to parents whom the Government like. As I said earlier, we shall use data from child benefit figures to try to approach all parents of eligible children to ensure that they have the choice of taking part in the voucher system. It is not a question of the Government wondering, "Do we like you?" It is for parents to decide that they want to use the system. That is a perfectly right and proper way of extending choice and it will certainly increase provision for pre-school education for four-year-olds and improve the quality of pre-school places, because of the inspection systems that will be set up. It will extend parental choice. Judging by what is happening in England now, the signs are that all those objectives will be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked me about the cost of not going ahead with the scheme. We have negotiated an opt-in clause to the national contract. Opt-in will occur only when the Government decide to go ahead with the scheme and that is not due to happen at present, so no costs have been or are to be incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman maintains his opposition to the order, because that shows that, like me, he is confident that the Government will still be Conservative after the general election and will be applying the scheme in Northern Ireland when resources permit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
