	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill (Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Once again I have to complain about the absence of the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings on Tuesday evening. While I appreciate that the House sat until quite late on Tuesday, the Committee rose at about 10 o'clock. It would not be unreasonable for us to expect to have access to the 
	<i>Official Report</i> this morning, given the length of time that has gone by and given the fact that the Committee rose fairly early on Tuesday in comparison with some of our other sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had been warned about the absence of the 
	<i>Official Report.</i> I sympathise with the hon Gentleman's point. The difficulty is that the printers are overwhelmed at the moment because of the number of Committees that are sitting. I hope that I shall have something to report later this morning. If the 
	<i>Official Report</i> is available, it will be made available immediately to the members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I appreciate that the fault lies not with the printers but with the Government, who are not prepared to pace the business of Parliament in such a way that the necessary services are capable of coping with it. We sought to make that point in the two sittings motion debates, and we would like to put on record again our view that the pace at which the Government are seeking to ram through legislation is totally inconsistent with a reasonable treatment of the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's remarks will no doubt be noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On another point of order, Mr. Hunt. This is an exploratory point. Technically—I imagine that the clock has been stopped at one minute to midnight—hon Members are still dealing on the Floor of the House with Wednesday's business, but for the purposes of the Committee it is 10.30 am on Thursday. Can you tell us under which time scale we are operating? Technically, it is Wednesday 1 April. I am not trying to make a point of order appropriate to April Fools' Day, but we ought to know whether we are meeting on Wednesday or on Thursday. If we are meeting on Wednesday, that is not in accordance with the sittings motion that was agreed by the Committee some weeks ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider that I am meeting accord
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
ing to the Notice Paper of the Committee, which clearly states that the date is Thursday 2 April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. As a relatively new Member of Parliament, I wonder whether you could help me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wasting time again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mr. Hunt, that you will rebuke the Minister for that unnecessary remark, once you have heard my point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely the ruling you have given to my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), but can you tell me what will happen if the House sits beyond 2.30 pm and Thursday's business is lost? What would happen to our afternoon sitting in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon Gentleman's question, although it is in some ways hypothetical. I believe that the precedents are being looked up now and that a ruling will be sought from the Speaker later this morning, which will no doubt be communicated to the members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must now concern ourselves, however, with the sitting on which we are engaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. If precedents are being looked at in respect of the afternoon sitting, and if we have an Amendment Paper dated Thursday 2 April, although the official date for the business of the House is 1 April, can you tell the Committee whether the precedents have been researched in regard to this morning's business, to see whether the current morning sitting is in order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a pity if we were to be detained unnecessarily in Committee if we were meeting without authority from the House. But if the position is in order, that would be a different matter. In the meantime, the House is still conducting the business of 1 April, and I should have thought that that business took precedence over that of Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the House has deemed it to be 1 April for the purpose of parliamentary business, it has, by implication, associated the Committees of the House with that same date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I inquired specifically into that point before our sitting began. I am assured that there are precedents for this. The last was on 21 June 1977 in respect of the Abortion (Amendment) Bill Committee. We must now proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 132, in page 28, line 22, after "examinations", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for which, in the opinion of the pupils' parents, he should be presented.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 133, in page 28, line 25, leave out subsection (8).</p>

	<p>No. 135, in page 30, line 34, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) The Secretary of State shall exercise his power to make regulations under this section so as to ensure that in relation to a pupil who is required to live away from home in order to attend a local authority school and who is accepted as a pupil at a school under section 75A(1) of this Act the education authority shall pay boarding fees equivalent to those which would be incurred by that pupils' attendance at the local authority school."</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are concerned with the fees in regard to the assisted-places scheme. We seek to ensure that the scheme, which we consider to have been somewhat carelessly constructed, is examined. The first aspect that we should like to consider this morning is boarding fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of boarding schools is rather vexed in education circles. Many of us feel that an integral part of a child's life and development is that which he shares with his immediate family. It may be deleterious to a child's development to take him away from his home environment and place him in a rather austere institution which robs him of his parents' affection. That is as important at the time of puberty as at any other time—perhaps even more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we recognise that many of the schools in the scheme—although not all—hitherto have not taken in day pupils. The exclusion from the scheme of boarding fees may result in schools having to provide extra facilities. We should like the Minister to tell us which schools, which at present have only boarding pupils, will make alternative arrangements to supplement the assisted places scheme by paying boarding fees so that pupils can enjoy—if that is the right expression—the full range of alleged benefits that such schools afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that in the knowledge that boarding schools are viewed with some suspicion regarding the contribution which they make to the well-being and development of young people. We recognise that in certain circumstances boarding schools are, at best, an unhappy compromise. There are people who work abroad where the educational provision in English is not as satisfactory as they would wish. Therefore, they are obliged to send their children to Britain to be educated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are occasions when children can stay with aunts and uncles or with grandparents. The family unit can be retained as they can attend a day school either within the local authority area or in the private sector of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are not dealing with that group of people today. We are dealing with people from modest backgrounds who will be offered the opportunity of attending those schools. I say "offered the opportunity" in a general sense because as yet the Minister has not given a clear indication about the method of assessing the suitability of those young
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
people for the scheme. However, we shall work on the assumption that in the first instance they are acceptable to the school. We must know which institutions in the scheme will offer boarding places, assuming that the money will have to come from school funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that some of the schools at present offer only boarding education. They do not provide for day school facilities. We should like to know which schools involved in the scheme are seeking to make financial provision to support the young people. We should also like to know about those schools which hitherto had only boarding pupils and are now introducing day pupils as an extra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of boarding fees raises certain problems. We recognise that some schools offer extracurricular activities which are important to an all-round education. For children to participate in such extra-curricular activities, they would be expected to live in the school. If children have to make a 50-mile round trip—the Minister has said that that is the distance which children should be expected to travel if they are to participate in the scheme—and the schools have a wide range of extra-curricular activities which can be entered into only if the children are boarding, we consider that the assisted places scheme will not meet the full prospectus. The scheme will not meet its full educational objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, we have grave misgivings about the exclusion of boarding fees. We do not wish to see any more money spent on the scheme than we can afford; it should be the utter minimum. We made a point, somewhat ineptly the other night, when we chose a figure which was no higher than that which was made available to grant-aided schools in 1979 during the lifetime of the previous Labour Government. If young people are to have access to the full facilities, we question the Minister's exclusion of boarding fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a probing amendment which we do not intend to push to a vote, but we think that this is a legitimate point which shows the Government's confused and simplistic approach. They have not thought through the full educational implications of the scheme and certainly not about those institutions which have provided boarding facilities only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to discover the Minister's thoughts—if any—on this matter. The exclusion of boarding fees may have been thrown in as an afterthought—"We cannot spend too much money, so we cannot pay boarding fees." An amendment in the names of some of the Minister's hon Friends deals with travelling expenses, where it is considered that it may be better that the child should stay at the school rather than travel back and forth every day. That amendment will doubtless be reached some time today. Our amendment is not concerned with travelling only. It is perhaps indicative of the Government's views that they are preoccupied with travelling, as a purely material matter, whereas our amendment is rooted in consideration of the educational aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have grave misgivings about the use of boarding education. We recognise that in certain circumstances young people's education cannot be pro
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
vided by any other means in the United Kingdom —if parents are abroad and if there are no relatives and grandparents who can look after the children so that they can attend day school at the same time as enjoying the full benefits of family life. The Opposition are not sympathetic to boarding schools, because we feel that they prevent children from benefiting from the full range and depth of family life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, if schools which hitherto have offered only boarding places will be offering something akin to second best under the scheme, we want to know how the Minister has arrived at such a compromise with the schools and how it would be dealt with under the scheme. This is why we have moved the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 131 concerns other charges by a school in addition to fees. The amendment would have the effect of excluding
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other charges, if any, as may be prescribed by regulations".</p></blockquote>
We have seen some of the other charges mentioned in regulations. In debates earlier in the week, when we strayed close to being out of order, we raised the matter of the other charges. We touched on academic expenditure and quoted the example of the provision of science courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not many new textbooks have been produced in the past two or three years for A-level Latin and Greek. Not many cassette tapes are required in the language laboratories to master Cicero, Livy, Virgil or other classical writers. Certain subjects, therefore, require less expenditure by schools on the provision of materials. However, expenditure is required for technical subjects where materials have to be provided—timber, metal—and the initial outlay on equipment involves a considerable amount of money. The same applies to business studies where pupils expect to have access to typewriters and word processors. For computing courses there have to be many computers. In the State local authority-funded area a great deal of money is now being spent to assist young people to come to terms with modern technology. That takes money, and the sort of schools that provide those facilities are usually in the State sector. But extra charges are sometimes levied in the private sector in the form of a higher rate of fees per term. At other times those charges are met out of the imposition of an additional levy on each pupil who embarks on those courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other evening, the Minister did not give us a satisfactory answer about definition concerning the academic charges that relate to course content. There are also charges for other subjects such as musk; lessons, games, membership of societies, and so on. The Minister has been understandably coy in his replies because he does not know how much would be entailed. Therefore, we hope that, having had the luxury of a couple of days' grace in which to sort out those matters, he can be more specific than he was previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 is also a probing amendment. We are happy for this provision to be included because the various prospectuses show that there are wide variations in fees. That can result from many
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
aspects such as the wealth of the school in respect of its historical accumulation of endowments which enable the fees to be reduced. The school may have a high level of expenditure on new equipment, new dormitories and new buildings so that in that instance, the financial resources must be extended, and it is therefore necessary to charge higher fees. The schools may be run not just as charities but in such a way as to ensure a surplus from year to year. There are also problems with the effect of charges such as value added tax, which rose to 15 per cent in June 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, all that will result in differing fee levels, and we are happy that the Secretary of State has the power to consider seriously the level of fees to see whether it is excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask the Minister to explain what he means by the word "excessive". We know that sometimes the Secretary of State's view of what is excessive is somewhat different from that held by, for example, Lothian region on rates rises. The word "excessive" could be used rather more generously in the interests of fee paying schools than it is in the interests of Labour local authorities, which merely seek to provide a reasonable education service for ratepayers and their children. Therefore, amendment No. 133 is a probing amendment and we should not like subsection (8) to be removed from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were surprised that the Minister did not seek to underpin subsection (7X£), but it is significant that one of the hallmarks of the Government's approach to legislation is that they should seek to cavil and cajole the local authority sector wherever they can and leave the private sector virtually without great obligations. The paragraph is concerned with the provision of examination entrance fees in respect of candidates from a school but makes no clear statement—such as was included in the parents' charter—of the rights of parents to insist that their children be allowed to take particular courses and be entered for particular examinations. We have sought to extend those rights to cover this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not feel that the Government have been fair with the parents of children who will take part in the assisted places scheme. They ought to state specifically that parents of children in the scheme should be treated in exactly the same way as parents who send their children to local authority schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that on occasions parents have a somewhat inflated sense of their children's abilities and that they might present them for courses and examinations which may not be suitable. In all our discussions the Government have never given a clear indication of the required ability range of children and the manner in which that would be determined. We had some doubts when we discussed the matter in regard to the local authority sector, but since it is included in parental rights in that sector, it should be included in the private sector, especially as the funds are to be provided by the Excheqeur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All our amendments in this group are probing amendments. We do not expect to have to vote on them. But we think that these areas should be explored, because the regulations to which they refer were published only on Monday—a point about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
which we have already complained—and a Prayer has been tabled in order that the amendments may be considered by the House within 40 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of our opposition to the assisted-places scheme, we shall seek to oppose the statutory instrument containing the regulations at the appropriate opportunity. Nevertheless, it would be helpful for our debate to hear replies from the Minister to some of the matters that we have raised on this part of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make no further comment on the amendments. We shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment after we have heard the ministerial reply, which I hope we shall not hear until some of my colleagues have had an opportunity to make additional comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you are weary, Mr. Hunt, like all members of the Committee, although you look fresh enough. I am certainly weary, but I am undaunted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stick to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to speak to the amendments. Once again, the Under-Secretary is commenting from a sedentary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that you accepted my point of order, Mr. Hunt, as a genuine point of order. Those of my hon Friends who do not claim to have as much knowledge of specialised fields of education as many other members of the Committee—whether education in Scotland or education throughout the United Kingdom—need to be allowed some latitude. If they stray slightly, they should not be brought back into line too quickly but should be allowed to make their points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) has said that these are probing amendments, and I would not wish to be seen supporting this group of amendments. It is remarkable that it has been left to my hon Friends to table amendments to ensure that choice and privilege are available to those whose interests hon Members on the Conservative Benches normally represent on these matters. It seems ridiculous to talk about choice at the beginning of the Bill—I shall not strain your patience, Mr. Hunt, by suggesting that we should return to that point—when in the area that is most important to parents—the presentation of pupils for O-levels and highers—there is no choice for those parents, and matters will be left to the diktat of the school or the headmaster. We know what sort of schools we are dealing with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the exclusive old boys' network, the exclusive clubs, the schools where the blazer with the hole in the sleeve is not acceptable, the schools where there is snobbery at every level; but the parents are to have no choice as to whether their children are to be presented for O-levels and highers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 would insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for which, in the opinion of the pupil's parents, he should be presented."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
I would have preferred the words to be "they should be presented" so that girls were included too, but the idea is there. We tabled the amendment so that we might be told why no Conservative Members had tabled such an amendment or why that point was not included in the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that grant-aided and independent schools will now be charged for the number of presentations they make for SCE examinations. I am sure that my hon Friends will agree that that change is long overdue. The schools should be charged for the expensive arrangements. If that logic is to be maintained under the assisted-places scheme, the schools must be made to pay for the candidates entered under the scheme for O-grade, higher and SYS exams. They should not be subsidised by the State in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment is important and necessary because we do not trust these schools to make objective judgments about pupils entering under the scheme. Those are the people about whom we are concerned. We hope that working-class parents will not take advantage of the scheme, but if, being overwhelmed by the Minister's argument, they then take advantage of the scheme and pass all the barriers regarding their background and social mix, they should be protected. The objective judgment that would be made about such children is not one that should be left to people who have run the schools for many years and who never before have been concerned about working-class children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that what I am saying does not interest Conservative hon Members. I think that the record should note that not one Conservative Member is listening to the debate. If they wish to claim that they are concerned about kids from Linlathens, Mid Craigie, Beechwood and Whitfield befitting from the assisted-places scheme, they should, at least, listen to what we say. They may not agree and may think that what we say is unimportant, but they should listen to see whether they can reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Secretary of State's perfect world pupils whose ability is good, bad, or indifferent—although we have not yet worked out whether that is the analogy written into the Bill, or whether it is the Minister's analogy on Second Reading—should be able to benefit from the scheme. In reality, we know that these schools will fight tooth and nail against the scheme. It will be interesting to see how many inquiries are made and how much support the Secretary of State gives to working-class children who wish to avail themselves of the scheme. However, let us assume a miracle unprecedented in Scottish educational history, whereby some children manage to pass all the class barriers and the entrance exams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various schools, including Dundee high school, have decided without any consent from Parliament that there should be an entrance exam. Let us suppose that a board of trustees, people such as ourselves, have had an all-night sitting and perhaps it is not too alert next morning and so some of these children get through, or, just to appease the Secretary of State, that it lets them through. Therefore, a school may find that it has children, under the assisted-places scheme, whose background and ability do not match up to its normal standards. Once these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
children get through, that is where our concern begins. Without this amendment to the Bill we do not believe that those children will have equitable treatment from the school with regard to presentation for academic examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When schools present pupils for the SCE examinations, they would undoubtedly discriminate against these children in a manner which would not happen in the State sector. One only has to read the ISIS booklet or any of the year books to understand that. One criterion that these schools value, which does not exist in a State school, is the need for excellence in regard to standards and passes at a certain level. That is one of the selling points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is like an insurance salesman trying to sell a policy. He tries to assure the person to whom he is selling that the firm is reputable. We know that we must be careful about car insurance because a number of insurance companies have gone out of business despite the fact that when the big sell took place, the salesman assured us that the company was rock solid. Motorists had to pay the price when they discovered that they had to reinsure their vehicles, which were not covered by insurance for accident. This matter is more important than car insurance—and I do not intend to go down the alley of that analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When these schools are selling themselves to appease the Secretary of State, by showing that they are making an effort to bring these kids in, they will undoubtedly stress—and I imagine they will also stress under the assisted-places scheme—the excellence of the school, the number of pupils presented for O-grades and highers, the number of pupils who pass, and at what level. The ISIS and other year books stress traditions and history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that no working-class kids from my constituency make the fatal mistake of going to any of these schools on assisted-places, but if they do, the Government should seek to protect them. Unless the Government are prepared to give us an assurance or write another amendment into the Bill, or support us on amendment No. 132, there will be no freedom of choice to ensure that children coming in under the assisted places scheme are presented equitably for O-level and highers examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall listen carefully to the Minister's reply to this short debate. The aim of this group of probing amendments is to protect those who are foolish enough to take advantage of the scheme, and we may have to bring the amendment back on Report and force a Division, to make it clear that the Government's words are hollow when it comes to choice for those who wish to take advantage of the assisted-plaoes scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no fears if the kids stay in the State sector. I am sure that my hon Friends the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr Canavan)—if he were here—and the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) would be able to assure the Committee that teachers in the State sector bend over backwards to present for examinations as many pupils as they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would even argue that the majority of teachers with whom I have come in contact go out of their way to present even those children who appear to be below the border line for a pass result, to give such
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
children a chance in the hope that on the day it will give them the impetus to gain a qualification which may assist them in getting jobs—although we know that there is little chance for kids in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom to get jobs at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the State sector it is one of the overriding priorities of all teachers with responsibility for putting forward pupils for O-levels and highers, that they should bend over backwards to ensure that the maximum number of pupils are allowed to take the exams. They try to help the child through. We do not believe that this will happen within the assisted-places scheme in the grant-aided and independent schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I would prefer the scheme not to be introduced, it is right that we should probe the intentions of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr MacKay) on this matter, and those of the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr Walker), who unfortunately is not here at the moment. I would like to know how it will be ensured that parents have the choice as to whether their children are presented for 04evels and higher examinations. It must be enshrined in the Bill, if it is ever enacted, to protect the children who have the privilege of being in the assisted places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 is a probing amendment, but my hon Friend said that we would listen closely to the Minister's remarks and that if he did not reassure us, we might press the matter on Report. We believe that the choice of whether a child is presented should not be left to the headmaster. The parents should also have equal rights in respect of their child, on whom they have spent a lot of money if they have taken advantage of the assisted places scheme. We had a debate two sittings ago, when you were not in the Chair, Mr. Hunt, about the amount of money that would be required to send a child to one of those schools. But, if working-class families have to spend that much money to put their children in what they think are advantageous schools, they should have a choice about whether children will be presented so that they can argue about it if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most unusual for me to appear to be speaking in support of the assisted-places scheme. I hope that my meaning is not misconstrued, because I am totally opposed to it. But the step that we are advocating must be taken because those schools are obsessed with character. We are not talking about a sort of Jock Wallace character—the one who sent the Rangers players up and down the sands at Troon. But we are concerned about the character that they seek to build into the school to maintain all the privileges that come in later life and which go with attendance there. That character may work against the wishes of parents whose children take part in the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that we shall be listening closely to hear how the hon Members for Perth and East Perthshire, Argyll. South Angus—if he comes into Committee this morning—Galloway (Mr. Lang), and Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) will fight to ensure that

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Dundee, West keeps telling the Committee that he is a seeker of truth. In Scotland we do not have O-levels; we have O-grades and higher grades. The English system has O-levels and A-levels. I accept that the hon Gentleman may be a little confused because some of the schools in the assisted-places scheme present pupils for both types of examination. But, as he used the terms "O-levels" and "highers" in the same sentence, he may not be sure about the examination system in the United Kingdom. The O-grades in Scotland are significantly different—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have helped the hon Gentleman because I should not like the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) to get hold of the idea that the hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) knew nothing about Scottish education and confused it with the English system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found this morning's speeches very interesting. It seems to me that the Opposition cannot decide whether they are for or against the assisted-places scheme. On Tuesday they seemed to be against it—a logical position for them to take up, given their general Socialist philosophy. But today, they appear to be in favour of the scheme. They seem to want to spend more money on it and to widen it to bring in more children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friends and I had a chat while the hon Gentleman was speaking. We were greatly tempted to vote against the withdrawal of amendments Nos. 130 and 131, and ensure that they went into the Bill in the name of the Opposition. I do not know whether that would embarrass them here, but I am sure that it would embarrass them a great deal when they-had to explain to their reselection committees why they had, chosen to table amendments to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
assisted-places scheme so that it cost more money and allowed more children to go to private schools. But perhaps in order to distinguish themselves from the Social Democrats, the Opposition have decided to come out in favour of private education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 132. I should be interested to hear what my hon Friend the Minster says, but I think that the amendment is unnecessary. I should like to know whether similar wording applies to the State sector when, in a dispute, teachers and parents attempt to arrive at an agreement. I know from experience that if no agreement is possible, the teachers usually bow to the parents' wishes, on the very unusual occasions that it occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am almost sure that there is no statutory backing of such a nature in the State system. I have no experience of the private sector, like the hon Member for Dundee, West, but I am sure that the teachers there—certainly those whom I have met— take the same view of arriving at decisions about presentation first on ability, and whether it is worth taking the chance and the pupil doing the work, when he may not pass the examination. They probably also take into account the parents' views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak in detail about amendment No. 135. I accept that it would be an advantage if we could arrive at the situation which the Opposition are requesting—that any child who attends a private school and requires to be boarded should have his boarding fees paid by the Secretary of State under the assisted-places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very far seeing to table an amendment such as this because it would improve the chances of many children outwith the area of the private schools. But I am aware that these are difficult times and that money is in short supply. Unlike the Labour Party, I have not yet found the tree on which money grows in the Palace of Westminster, or anywhere else. I accept that at this stage in our economy we must be a bit careful about how we spend public money. But I hope that, with the support of the Opposition, when the economy begins to improve, we may have another Bill in which we shall expand the assisted-places scheme to boarders. We look forward to the Opposition's support in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is designed particularly for those children in remote rural areas who now have to go away to school and board at State schools. Many children in my constituency—"many" is perhaps an exaggeration, but certainly a number—attend Keil school in Dunbartonshire. There is an historical connection between my constituency and Keil school in Dunbartonshire, because at one time Keil school was situated at Southend in the Mull of Kintyre, which has since become famous in song. The school was burnt down, and instead of being replaced in Southend it was moved to Dunbartonshire. There is still, however, an historical link with Argyll, and children from Argyll—as well as many other parts of Scotland
	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup -->—go to that school. To a more limited extent, pupils from Argyll also go to Lomond school at Helensburgh and, indeed, to other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that some of those pupils could attend a State school and go from home to school every
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
day, but many of them would
	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --> have to stay away from home in any case in order to attend school. They would have to go either into digs or into one of the school hostels in Oban or Dunoon. Many parents are reasonably satisfied with that situation, especially those who live near enough to the centres to have the children home at weekends. But some children go away at the beginning of term and do not return home until the end of term. They spend no weekends at home because the travel arrangements are impossible. Some of the parents of those children would be very interested in the assisted-places scheme. If their children have to go away, the parents would prefer them to go to a seven-day-a-week boarding school than to a day school with a hostel. Such a school may do its best by the children but it cannot provide the seven-day educational environment of a boarding school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Boarding fees at State-sector schools, for the small number of children in the rural constituencies of Scotland who have to stay away from home are already costing the local authority money. No more money would have to be spent if my amendment were made. I am simply saying that if a pupil in such circumstances goes to a private school under the assisted-places scheme, the authority should contribute towards the boarding fees what it would have had to pay if the child had boarded in Oban or Dunoon in order to attend the local State school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within that minority itself, there is another rather special minority. I can illustrate it by mentioning one of my constituents, who lives on the island of Colonsay. Colonsay is a very small island and has some very difficult problems. I have high hopes that the Minister will be helpful to me in this case, because he has already been extremely helpful towards Colonsay. The island's electricity supply used to be the most expensive in the United Kingdom by miles, but, thanks to the Conservative Government and to the Common Market, steps are being taken to reduce that cost and to link the island to the main grid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is on the island a small local primary school, where I spent two very interesting hours last summer. The parent I have in mind is a Catholic. He is perfectly happy to allow his children to go to the local primary school, but he would like them to go to a Catholic secondary school. However, under Strathclyde's arrangements, they will go to Oban high school, which is non-denominational. They will board at Oban high school and will not return home for the weekends. In order to attend school, they will have to go away from home for the whole term. Their father feels—and I have a great deal of sympathy with him—that it would be better, and would be in accordance with his choice, if the children could go to a Catholic private school, where they would receive a Catholic education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That parent will probably be eligible for the assisted-places scheme. It is not unreasonable to assume that he would find the boarding fees rather difficult to cover—and the local authority will have to find boarding fees for his children in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given that example because that parent has a very valid religious reason for wanting his child
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
to attend a private school. In the central belt, we allow separate Catholic education. The Labour Party, the Conservative Party and all other parties in Argyll—despite some objections inside them—are in favour of allowing Catholic parents to choose to send their children to Catholic schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have used the case of a particular parent as an example of a situation in which I think my amendment would be a great help. That parent would like his children to go to a Catholic school, but the boarding fees may well be a stumbling block. I happen to know that that parent would get a place at a Catholic school. He could be assisted with the fees under the assisted-places scheme and if my hon Friend accepted my amendment the local authority would then give him a contribution towards the boarding fees similar to the amount that it would have to spend to board his children if they attended the nearest comprehensive school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be no great increase in the amount of money spent on the assisted-places scheme. The money would have been spent in any case. The amendment would, however, help parents in scattered areas who have to face the problem of seeing their children go away, not to a boarding school but to a day school. A boarding school can provide supervision for 24 hours a day and seven days a week, with teaching staff being involved every day and a timetable for every day of the week. A day school, with the best will in the world, cannot provide that supervision. In those circumstances, I think my amendment would be a reasonable extension. I hope that my hon Friend will be prepared to accept that we should take this step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compared to the very large step that the Labour Party wanted to take in this general direction, it is only a very small step, and I am sure that Labour members of the Committee will welcome this modest contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I was drawing my remarks to a conclusion and suggesting to my hon Friend that he might consider these particular cases of children who have to stay in digs or a hostel in order to attend a State school. I was outlining a case of a Catholic parent who would prefer his child to have Catholic education. Many such parents might like the option of sending their child to a seven-day-week boarding school. They would be eligible for an assisted-places scheme, but the boarding aspect would be a hurdle for them to overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon Friend consider my amendment sympathetically, considering the small number of people involved who might like to take the option of sending their children away to a boarding school instead of placing them into hostel or "digs" accommodation at comprehensive schools?

Although I do not always agree with his analysis, he amplifies his remarks clearly. He is easy to understand, and it is a pity that from time to time he disagrees with me and my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross), whom I also enjoy listening to. I particularly enjoyed listening to the hon Gentleman this morning because he said that, as a new boy—we cannot say that we are new boys for
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
ever more—he knew very little about the education system. I did not know much about it either. Indeed, I was here because I was anxious to learn. I do not see any shame in that, so there is no reason why it should not be recorded. The hon Member for Argyll also seems to have a far better grasp of the system now. I feel almost like Mark Twain, who was astonished because he discovered between 12 and 14 how much knowledge his father had gained in those two years. I am almost equally astonished about the amount of knowledge that my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West has gained in this short time. His analysis this morning was brilliant, but I do not want to go over that ground again. I am merely on my feet to make a brief probing point on amendment No. 133.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed the remarks made by the hon Member for Argyll about how odd it was that we seemed to be promoting amendments to a Bill that we totally oppose. I do not think that that is odd. An analysis of our previous sittings has shown that we tend to be beaten. I do not think that we have succeeded in a vote. If we project that pattern to today's proceedings, it seems even more likely that we shall be defeated. Nevertheless, these are probing amendments and were put down, if for no other reason, to assist the education of my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West and myself. For those reasons I shall confine my remarks to amendment No. 133. I hope that the Minister will bear with me because I am seeking information from him—a nod of the head would be sufficient—to show me that I understand the meaning of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am correct, subsection (8) means that parents who successfully place one of their children in a private school may have to pay £x towards the fees and that the Government will foot the bill for the difference. Should the school increase its fees, the parents will have to pay only the original amount agreed to, while the Government will pay the increase. Am I thinking along the right lines? I am on the wrong lines? Obviously I am misunderstanding the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply on the amendment later. I do not want to interrupt the hon Gentleman. Perhaps he would repeat himself, because I do not follow the point that he is intending to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to amendment No. 133, which seeks to leave out subsection (8). My reading of subsection (8) was that the parents would pay a certain amount of money and that the Government would make up the difference on an assisted place, and if the school increased the fees, the parent would be bound to pay only the original sum and the Government would pay the amount of the increase, if the Secretary of State accepted the level of the increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I respond to that point now. Under the scheme, the normal fees which apply to all other children admitted to the school will be accepted as the fees for the assisted-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
places scheme. The parent will receive a sum to make up the fees, based on the income of the family. The qualification in the subsection provides that if the Secretary of State believes that a fee is, for whatever reason, excessive, he reserves the right to fix a notional fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if a school charges £2,000 a term, and if, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, a figure of £1,200 would be more appropriate in relation to the fees charged by other schools, the parents will only receive the difference between the parental contribution and £1,200 instead of the difference between the parental contribution and £2,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indebted to the Minister. I understand what he is saying. Am I therefore correct in assuming that, if the regulations were to continue, should there be an increase in the initial figure the Government would still contribute the initial sum and would not pay the increase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the Government will meet normal increases in school fees from one term or year to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand. That leads me to the point that I wish to question. My hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said earlier that there is then some difficulty in accepting that the Secretary of State should have the power to set these levels and regulations without reference to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the area which gives me concern, not because of the present incumbent of the post of Secretary of State for Scotland, but that any Secretary of State for Scotland should have that power. I am sure that hon Members would agree that probably the present Secretary of State for Scotland would be seen as supporting fee-paying and assisted places, and for that reason might be tempted to regard the part of the fees paid by the Government in a better light than would a Secretary of State who was opposed to the scheme. I believe that Government Members would accept that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if we are to be democrats—not Social Democrats, because, as the hon Member for Argyll (Mr MacKay) remarked, they have left us, thank heavens, and if we are to extend into the realms of what are now being called Liberal-Democrats, I would prefer to return to the true working-class Socialist democracy.—I see nothing undemocratic about suggesting that the regulations and the fees, upon which the Secretary of State would decide, should come back to the House for confirmation. After all, that would safeguard the public purse. We are all concerned about the shortfall in the public purse. The fact might be misconstrued in some areas that the Secretary of State for Scotland was seen to be pumping even more money into the private sector, whilst money was being cut back in and withdrawn from the public sector. It would be seen to be an unfair and undemocratic division of the spoils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to ensure that the democratic scrutiny of Parliament should approve by resolution the
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
provisions particularly of subsection (9X&) which deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conditions subject to which, the extent to which, and the arrangements in accordance with which, fees are to be remitted by participating schools".</p></blockquote>
That should be openly and honestly debated and decided by the House. If Conservative Members are in favour of open Government, I see no reason why they should feel indisposed to support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am indebted to the Minister for his guidance on an earlier question and I understand the position fully. I am happy to let the matter rest with amendment No. 133.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I explain the Government's view of the amendments. I would first advise the Committee that, in line with our policy throughout the Committee stage of providing information for the Committee, we are placing on the Table today the consultation document for the regulations under clause 6, which deals with school closures, and so on. Members of the Committee will be able to consider the matter over the weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to amendment No. 130, which deals with boarding fees. It is not our intention to extend the scheme to include boarding fees. We much prefer—I ask my hon Friends to take this into account—the Dill as it stands. As primary legislation, it excludes boarding fees from the assisted-places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting point. If the Minister is excluding boarding fees—which both he and the Bill make quite clear—why is Trinity college, Glenalmond, included in the list of schools, as it offers no day-school facility whatever—at least according to the prospectus that I have? It offers only boarding places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to that point. The matter was raised by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). A number of public boarding schools—as they are generally called—including Glenalmond, Fettes, Loretto and Gordonstoun, have been accepted into the assisted-places scheme. Some of them take day pupils and some do not. The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) says that Glenalmond is one of the schools which do not. But admission to the scheme does not require a school to take day pupils. Some schools which do not presently take day pupils may take them in future. But that is entirely a matter for those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be easier if I explained that the reason why some boarding schools which do not take day pupils have applied for and been accepted into the scheme is simply that they have offered to take in a limited number of boarders and to meet the boarding Costs from their own funds. Therefore the scheme will operate for a boarder in exactly the same way as it operates for a day pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Fettes school approached me more than a year ago when discussions and consultations were taking place, and said that it would like to offer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
a number of boarding places, provided that the cost of the normal day-fee tuition was met under the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I missed the beginning of the hon Member's remarks, but I think that I have heard enough to appreciate his point. I wonder whether he could be a little more specific about the criteria upon which he is prepared to accept the undertakings from schools which hitherto have only had boarding pupils. What are the arrangements concerning the amount of subsidy? Will those subsidies be carried on over a period of years so that young people are not taken on as boarders by a school which, at a later stage, might say "We are unable to sustain the cost of boarding fees"? Will an undertaking be given by schools that they will maintain these children for as long as the scheme is in operation and for as long as the children require their education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can foresee the scheme being wound up immediately, or as quickly as possible, after the return of the next Labour Government. In the unlikely event of a Labour Government not being returned at the next election and the country perhaps getting even deeper into the economic mire, there is a possibility that the schools concerned will not be capable of sustaining the financial burden for the duration of a child's education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving aside the hon Gentleman's wishful thinking about the prospect of another Labour Government, which may or may not happen, I appreciate his point about the importance of an undertaking or agreement being made between the school and the parents. If a child is admitted to a school under an arrangement whereby the scheme furnishes the day tuition costs and the school provides the boarding costs, the school must take its responsibility seriously for the duration of the child's normal school time at that school. Nothing in the scheme provides such an undertaking in the event of a school, for a disciplinary reason, deciding to remove the child, or if the school suffers financial hardship which would end the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to consider this matter further on the basis that an agreement could be made between the parents and school. It would not be a matter for the Government. The Government could not bind a school for future years on the basis of its financial viability. It would be unrealistic to do so. However, I shall consider how the scheme could commit a school to give an undertaking to parents that in normal circumstances the child, once admitted, would have a boarding place at that school for the duration of his education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for making that clear. It is surprising that the Government had not thought about this aspect until we raised it. If they had, we have not had the pat replies which we normally receive from the Minister when we raise such questions. I am grateful to him for undertaking to look into the matter, and I hope that he will be able to say on Report in what framework the scheme will operate. I am shocked at the manner
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
in which the Government have entered into the scheme without taking on board such a consideration. I appreciate that it might not involve many children, but those who might be affected will be involved 100 percent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangement will not just be between the school and the parents. For the school to be a party to the agreement in the first place, it must get the Government's support to allow it to be part of the scheme. Therefore, the Government have a responsibility, and I hope that the Minister on Report will be able to clarify that arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have to wait until the Bill reaches the Report stage to mention the Government's responsibility. I am not trying to avoid that in any way. The Government's responsibility in accepting a school into the scheme is to ensure that the school satisfies Her Majesty's inspectors. Those are the experts who advise my right hon Friend and I and the Scottish Education Department whether the school should be accepted. As I said earlier, two schools applied to join which were not accepted because the inspectorate could not give them a satisfactory report. There are distinct Government responsibilities regarding admission of a school into the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an arrangement between the parent and the school. The parents apply to the school and the Government are not involved; in the application —neither the central Government nor local government. The hon Gentleman is saying that that agreement should be for the duration of a child's education. I would not imagine that that agreement would be any different in the case of an assisted-places child from that for any other child at that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon Gentleman is going further, although I welcome the constructive view that he has taken of the scheme on more than one occasion. He is asking what would happen if a school got fed up with the assisted-places scheme, for whatever reason —perhaps because it found the boarding too expensive. Would it just turf the child out halfway through his education? That is a very important matter and, shocked as the hon Gentleman may be, I am grateful to him for raising it, because my officials may be able to tell me the answer shortly. It is basically a matter between parents and the school, but I shall wish to return to it later because it is of considerable importance. I repeat my gratitude to the hon Gentleman for pointing it out to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well happen. Under schedule 4(1), there is provision for the revocation of determination on the part of
	<br><blockquote><p>The proprietors and managers of a participating school".</p></blockquote>
The initiative must come from the proprietors and manager, and there must be three years' written notice. But that will still not get around the problem of a child in S2, who has four more years of education, or in year six which, in some respects, for an academic high-flyer or a bright child^-4o use the Conservative Party manifesto's jargon—may be the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
critical year for the furtherance of his educational progress. So the point is covered to an extent, but not fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I appreciate the hon Gentleman's point. It is very helpful. I can only repeat that I shall return to it at the earliest opportunity —which may be just at hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that it will be a condition of each school's determination that a pupil has a place for life—"life" being an expression which covers the conditions that the hon Gentleman has raised. I presume that the word means—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The educational life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I am grateful to our adviser the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—the educational life or span.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to quibble on this point but we appear to have struck a rich seam and we had better explore it and howk out what we can from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed a feature of public school education when I lived in north Edinburgh. Fortunately, the hon Gentleman did not represent the Edinburgh, North constituency then—I had left by the time he was elected. I have seen some of the pupils at the schools which may be accepted into the scheme, and some of them looked gey old—they were certainly more than 18. The Minister had better be clear about what he means by "life", because some pupils in those schools no longer go round in short trousers. They are strapping lads—for want of a better expression—of 19 and 20 who are being kept on to pick up whatever A-levels and highers and so on that they require for their next educational institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We probably need something more specific than educational life, because some of those pupils appear to enjoy a degree of reincarnation that children in the local authority sector cannot always benefit from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon Gentleman's point. In this context, "life" ends at the age of 20, or when the child normally leaves school, for the purposes of this determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the hon Gentleman's point about a pupil being excluded from a school because of a determination in paragraph 1 of schedule 4. In paragraph 6 of the same schedule, we see that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Revocation of a determination shall not affect the operation of—

	<ol>

	<li>the determination;</li>

	<li>the scheme in relation to which the determination was made; or</li>

	<li>any regulations made under section 75A or 75B of this Act,</li>
</ol>
in relation to any pupil holding an assisted place at the school on the date of the revocation."</p></blockquote>
I am happy therefore to be able to confirm to the hon Gentleman that that would safeguard a child in a school in the event of that school seeking a determination under paragraph 1 of schedule 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that paragraphs 1 and 6 of schedule 4 seem to be at variance with each other. I know that we are coming to that schedule later, but the point is relevant here. If three years' notice is given and the school has to shut up shop or something like that, has the Secretary of State any control over the school and its undertakings after the three years have expired and the determination has ceased?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a legal man and there may be some nuance which is escaping me, but in the interests of clarity it might be helpful if some reflection were given to what appears to be a blatant inconsistency. I know that the Government Benches are not bereft of legal advice and that even the mute and glorious Whip might be able to give us the benefit of his considerable experience on these matters. I am sure that a man of his generosity would be prepared to do it for nothing—he could not do it in any other way, since he is under the auspices of the Patronage Secretary, an office of profit under the Crown. Perhaps we could get legal advice on the cheap from the hon Gentleman on the Minister's right and get the thing sorted out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon Gentleman, I am not a lawyer, but I do not think that one has to be to understand the thrust of the two points that he is now making. I see no contradiction between paragraph 1 and paragraph 6, because paragraph 1 deals with the proprietors or managers requesting to "revoke the determination" and having to give "three years' written notice". That is quite freestanding and applies where a school decides for some reason to come out of the assisted-places scheme. Paragraph 
	<i>6(c)</i> states that revocation will not affect the operation of
	<br><blockquote><p>"any regulations made under section 75A or 75B of this Act in relation to any pupil holding an assisted place at the school on the date of the revocation",</p></blockquote>
which means that the child is enabled to complete his term at the school. That covers the initial point raised by the hon Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to what might happen when a school closes down or becomes bankrupt—which I agree could happen—other considerations must apply, but one cannot legislate for everything that might happen. That would have a bearing on all the school's commitments and all its children—not just those with assisted-places. But if I am advised about anything else which is relevant to a school going bankrupt or closing down for some other reason, I shall happily come back to the hon Gentleman with the information at the first opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I have obtained two cards addressed to my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) whom you had to ask to leave the Committee. The first is from the Clerk to the Committee of Selection—I believe that his name is Mr. D. Gerhold—and says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the committee have nominated you a member of a Scottish Standing Committee in respect of the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
The second states that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"First Scottish Standing Committee will meet on Thursday 2 April, at 10.30 am, in Room 10 and 4.30 pm, in Room 9, further to consider the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill."</p></blockquote>
As my hon Friend has received those communications, surely that is an official announcement from the House that he is a member of the Committee and therefore entitled to take part in this morning's deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the point of order is that those are administrative notifications and do not carry the authority of the House. As a result of the protracted proceedings in the House, the necessary authorisation has not yet been made. That is my ruling, and therefore the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is not yet a member of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. With respect, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that there is an Order Paper for Thursday 2 April. As you will appreciate, the Orders of the Day and Notices of Motion will determine whether the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) should be a member of this Committee. In fact, according to the alterations made by the Chairman of the Committee of Selection, the hon Gentleman's name is not shown in the Order of the Day that would have applied had the Business of the House been put into operation. Therefore your ruling is perfectly correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I do not wish to delay the Committee unnecessarily, but I hope that you will understand that
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
my hon Friend and I will wish to follow up the matter before half-past Four. I should be grateful if you and the Clerk to the Committee would do the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and I acknowledge the hon Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was pointing out to the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, before he returned to the Committee earlier I had made clear that, with regard to amendment No. 130 the Government do not intend to extend the assisted-places scheme to include boarding fees. That is why we wish to retain in primary legislation the wording contained in clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turned now to amendment No. 131, which would remove the Secretary of State's power to prescribe charges as being fees in relation to which the assisted-places scheme will not have effect. The starting point is the provision that the fees to which the scheme applies are the fees
	<br><blockquote><p>"the payment of which is a condition of attendance".</p></blockquote>
One may find schools imposing charges on their pupils covering anything from the fund for the repair of the pipe organ to a memorial for some particularly revered teacher who has retired. In certain circumstances, the payment of contributions of that kind could be legally regarded as a condition of attendance. We want to have the power to keep control over that sort of charge on a pupil. For that reason we prefer to leave the wording in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>It being One o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee, without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
