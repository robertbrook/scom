<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Committee adjourned before the recess, I had explained the general view that had been taken about this matter in the past, that, due to the rare nature of such trial periods, there did not seem to be any argument for such an experiment on this occasion. Indeed, I quoted the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in support of that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Misquoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I have made all the observations that I wanted to make about that proposal, and I therefore invite the Committee to take the view that the clause would be more appropriately dealt with on its merits. The Committee should either approve or not approve the proposals. It is always open to Parliament at any future date—in 3 years or 5 years—to reverse the decision taken on a previous occasion. There is therefore no need to write in
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
specific trial periods either for this or for other provisions. It would be a most unusual precedent either in criminal law or in other aspects of our legislation. On that basis, I am unable to commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to say how disappointed I am. I think the Under-Secretary is mistaken in his view. There is a great deal of public anxiety about the impact of the measures in the first part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be perfectly proper and appropriate that we should think in terms of a 5-year provision. I am strengthened in this belief by an ally in a somewhat unlikely quarter, at least in argument by analogy. The 
	<i>Sunday Express</i> of 25 May reported a speech in Glasgow made by the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor), who reverted to familiar themes. He was dealing with birching. He asked the following rhetorical question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is it too much to hope … that Home Office Ministers in the Conservative Government will conclude that the most effective way to curb crime and thereby to ease congestion in the courts and prisons might be to have stronger deterrents which would strike fear into the hearts of potential offenders?"</p></blockquote>
We might be able to reply to that question when we reach the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) on birching. The Solicitor-General for Scotland and the Under-Secretary supported a similar amendment on the previous Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southend, East then went on to say that he was strongly in favour of birching, but he asked that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… Parliament might introduce, as a five-year experiment, birching as a penalty.".</p></blockquote>
That seemed to be an extremely wise caveat in his usual unbridled passions in this matter. That was a respectable argument in Conservative terms for 5-year experiments when introducing controversial legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly this is an extremely controversial matter. I am sorry that the Under-Secretary has not looked upon these amendments with a kinder eye, particularly in view of the findings of the Scottish Council on Crime. I hope that my hon. Friends will press this matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to the clause stand part debate on what is probably one of the most important changes affecting not only the police, but the people of Scotland. Although we have been through many of the arguments, it is important to place on record yet again the Opposition's serious reservations about the clause, its important implications for personal liberty, and the difficulties that its implementation will present to police forces. While the Committee will decide the matter at the end of the debate, I should not want anyone outside the Committee to feel that this will be the end of the matter, because for the first time in the nine or 10 years that I have been in the House I can say in all honesty that this is a House of Commons matter and will have to be decided finally on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this because there is widespread feeling among hon. Members on all sides of the House—from English, Welsh and Irish constituencies as well as Scottish—that this power which is being introduced in Scotland could easily spread to England and Wales. Some of our colleagues are apprehensive about the possibility of the extension of the power to other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, again, to put on record the origin of these proposals. They were contained in a report published by the Scottish Council on Crime, which was set up by the Conservative Government in 1972. But it has been felt that somehow these proposals were made by the Scottish Council on Crime because the council was confident that the stop and search powers would indeed reduce the amount of violent crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
When one reads the report of the council one finds that nothing could be further from the truth. In all the paragraphs dealing with this aspect of the legislation, the council hedges the matter with qualifications and reservations. Not least is the one that the Committee has just rejected—that if the power is to be introduced, it should be for a trial period of 5 years. The suggestion that the power should only be introduced for a trial period of 5 years is eloquent testimony of the uncertainty of the Scottish Council on Crime itself about the value of these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to page 44 of "Crime and the Prevention of Crime", the memorandum published by the Scottish Council on Crime. I should like the Minister to take these points on board, and to give us some answers to them. I have already asked what kind of publicity campaign the Government intend to launch before the powers are introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council says in paragraph 85 of its report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be wise to have a preparatory publicity campaign before any major change in present police practice was introduced but a considerable use of the power would be likely to be necessary, in addition to publicity, before the power could have the deterrent effect hoped for it."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Council on Crime is saying basically two things about the stop and search powers. One is that if these powers are to be introduced, the Government are under an obligation to carry out the most extensive publicity campaign so that all people affected by the powers—not those selected from the Wellmeadow and Blairgowrie—know that they have been introduced and that they are liable to be stopped and searched for offensive weapons, provided, of course, the police officers concerned have reasonable grounds
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
for suspecting that they are carrying them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that during our earlier debate he went a long way to resolve the fears that a great many people had expressed about indiscriminate stop and search powers. I suspect that during the Whitsun recess there has been a great deal of discussion about what the Minister said when he was giving undertakings that the matter would be dealt with by issuing guidance to chief constables. Clause 4 gives a major extension to police powers, and therefore I must express the strongest reservations and serious doubts about handling that by issuing circulars of guidance to chief constables throughout Scotland. I do not believe that that is the proper way to handle these new and extensive powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many hon. Members have said, there is no evidence to suggest that these new powers would reduce violent crime by one-half of one per cent. I think it was my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) who made the point that most violent crime now is not carried out with offensive weapons but by people kicking and using their boots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Solicitor-General for Scotland does not agree. Clearly, he has new evidence to which we shall no doubt come during the debate. However, it is generally accepted that while the carrying and use of offensive weapons is a serious problem—I do not understate that in any way—most of the injury suffered as a result of fighting and violent crime is sustained because one or other of the people involved in the fracas uses his feet rather than offensive weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come also to the damage that this kind of power is likely to do to relationships between the police and the public. When hon. Members question the possibility of an extension of police powers, they are usually accused of undermining the standing of the police force. I should like to lay that accusation by saying that in all my experience the most serious attack on the police force in Scotland or elsewhere is usually carried out by advocates in the courts who seek to use the discrediting of police evidence as a weapon. I know that advocates will argue that, when all is said and done, they are merely taking their clients' instructions.
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
But I remember one case in which the Solicitor-General for Scotland and his junior colleague the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) acted in the summer of 1978 where the defence case was based on a denigration of the police and a discrediting of their evidence. However funny that may seem to learned Members opposite, that police force is still reeling from the attacks that were launched on it in the Court of Session in Edinburgh. I mention that because it is a bit much when those of us who are opposed to clause 4 express concern about the good relations that we all want to see established between police and public are told that we are undermining the standing of the police force. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Solicitor-General says that he was merely accepting his client's instructions that day, I am prepared to accept that. I understand that position. But the general public do not understand it, and very often the police do not understand it, either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is to make what amounts to a professional attack, he should get the facts right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defence was an extremely complicated matter of law on whether the police had exceeded not so much their powers but their activities in what is called in the law of England—and doubtfully recognised in the law of Scotland—"set-up". It was not a denigration of the police. It was a question whether their activities amounted to "set-up". The failure of that defence resulted in the conviction of the accused. The case was heard not in the Court of Session but in the High Court of Justiciary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I appreciate that when advocates attack the police—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And, if I may say so, it was the firm in which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is a partner which instructed me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is all extremely interesting, but I remind hon. Members that we are debating clause 4 stand part. This is not a Second Reading debate. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
hope that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) will be more restrictive in his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 concerns stop and search powers, and they are stop and search powers which will lead to a deterioration in the relationship between the police and the public. It is for that important reason that I made those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the firm of Ross Harper and Murphy instructed the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I accept also that, when an advocate attacks the police force, it is always a matter of complicated law. But, when a Member of Parliament attacks a police force, he is undermining the police. I accept the subtle difference between what advocates do and what ordinary people do. I am not unaware of the infallibility that advocates claim for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the relationship between the police and the public. The report of the Scottish Council on Crime made the astonishing statement—and the Secretary of State himself repeated the fallacy—that the only people likely to be stopped and searched under the provisions of clause 4 were those who already had bad relations with the police. But we know that that is not true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) made an interesting statement in a radio programme—we have dealt with this point before—that in his constituency he did not expect anyone from Rosemount to be stopped and searched, but that he fully expected a whole host of his constituents from Wellmeadow and Blairgowrie to be stopped and searched. I wonder how on earth the hon. Member came to the conclusion that people from Rosemount would not be stopped and searched but that people from Wellmeadow would be. No doubt the hon. Member will now explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened to the radio programme carefully, he would have heard me say that I did not expect those in the Rosemount area to be stopped and searched very often. I expect those in Wellmeadow to be stopped and searched more frequently because that is where, especially on Saturday evenings, intruders congregate who do not live there. No doubt the
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
locals will be delighted that they will be stopped and searched. I hope that that is recorded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire would tell us how many stabbings, or how often the use of offensive weapons had been recorded in Wellmeadow. The approach of the hon. Gentleman is that of so many people—they are in favour of this provision basically because they believe that it will not affect them. That will be highlighted the first time that a Member of Parliament is stopped and searched in Scotland under suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government Whip, when in opposition, had a paper knife taken from him at Edinburgh airport and handed to the pilot. It was returned to him at Heathrow. Is a paper knife an offensive Weapon? If the hon. Gentleman regularly carries his paper knife, does he come under suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon with the intention of using it should he become involved in a fracas with some of his Back Bench hon. Friends who are desperate to get their last trains home on a Thursday night?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision will undoubtedly damage—I do not say seriously—the relationship between the police and the public. I suspect strongly that every hon. Member who has been in the House for any time will have received complaints from constituents about some activity of the police involving suspicion and the power to search individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were discussing the Labour Government's Bill, I gave the example of six young children in Stirling. If we are referring to families of standing as an interpretation and description that is to be used, I can assure the Committee that the young children were all regarded as coming from such families. The six, not one over 13 years of age, were in Woolworths on Boxing Day. All of them had sweets in their pockets, obviously from their Christmas stockings and presents received the previous day. However, a floor walker in Woolworths decided that the children had stolen the sweets. She sent for the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately—this is the crux of the matter—two very inexperienced police officers were sent to the incident. They took the six young children out of Woolworths and down the side of the shop and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
searched them all. I do not need to inform the Committee of the public row that developed in Stirling as a result of that incident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that that is an everyday occurrence. If it is claimed that these powers will prevent one violent crime being committed, it is reasonable for those of us who are against the implementation of the powers to argue that for every violent crime prevented there will be at least one or two breaches of the code of practice which the Minister said he would send to chief constables. The Committee will need to decide whether that will damage relations between the police and the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the argument often about the police having powers to stop and search for drugs. That is a relevant argument which is not easy to answer. It is significant that the police forces themselves have formed specialist groups—the drugs squads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost unheard of for a constable on the beat to stop someone and search him for drugs. We all know what happens normally. If a constable on the beat suspects that someone is carrying drugs, he keeps that person under surveillance until an officer from the drugs squad arrives. Police forces throughout the country have formed specialist drugs squads because of the problems connected with drug trafficking. Often it is not those who take the drugs but those who buy and sell them who cause the most difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will tell us whether it is suggested that the police forces should set up special squads to stop and search for offensive weapons. My hon. Friends and I, and no doubt some hon. Members on the Government Benches—especially the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), who has always been opposed to such measures—will be interested to know whether that is envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From where is the demand for such measures coming? Apart from the Government, only two groups have asked for stop and search powers. The Scottish Council on Crime has suggested that stop and search powers should be introduced, but under restricted conditions and for a trial period of 5 years only. The Government cannot call in aid the Scottish Council on Crime for the simple reason that the Government themselves do not accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
the council's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Council on Crime argues that an extensive use of the powers will be necessary before it is possible to judge the deterrent effect, but when answering a debate on some amendments to clause 4 the Minister said that he did not see the powers being used extensively. The Government do not accept that an extensive use of the powers will be necessary before we can judge the deterrent effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Council on Crime considers that the powers should be introduced for a 5-year trial period only. The Government have rejected that idea. They have again rejected the suggestions of the council. They cannot call in aid the views of the council as a justification for clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one other group that wants the powers—namely the police. We all know that the police would like these powers to be wider. I know that some chief constables are anxious to have power to stop anyone and search them for anything. Once these powers have been introduced, the day will come when they will be called in aid for a further extension of similar powers. Therein lies a great danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know too much about England and Wales, but over the past 10 or 15 years the police in Scotland, under successive Governments, have built up some good understandings with the public through their community involvement branches. It might be argued by the Scottish Council on Crime that those who will be stopped and searched are those who are on bad terms with the police force. Often the very people with whom the community involvement branch becomes involved are those who do not have a good relationship with the police force in the first place. The police force, through its community involvement branch, works at building up a good relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was the Minister responsible for the police in Scotland, I took the trouble to inspect the police community involvement work. No doubt the present Minister does so, too. We have seen some marvellous examples of how, in areas where the relationship between police and public was deplorable, great difficulties have been overcome and the police have built up a good relationship with the very people referred to by the Scottish Council on Crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that once a bad relationship between police and public has been established, it cannot be improved and a good relationship built up instead. All the evidence of the past 10 or 15 years, from Ferguslie, Paisley, Raploch in Stirling and other places in Glasgow and in the rest of Scotland show, that police community involvement works and succeeds in building up a good relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The risk of throwing away that good relationship is too great a risk to run for the sake of putting the clause on to the statute book. In two or three years it will be too late for hon. Members to say that they wished that the measure had never been introduced. Once it is introduced, it will be extremely difficult to take off the statute book. There can be no doubt that relationships between the police and the public will be seriously damaged, particularly in those areas where, because of police community involvement work, relationships are closest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that, as at all stages of the Committee, we shall win the argument but lose the vote. However, it is not too late for the Government to have second thoughts. It is not too late for the hon. Member for South Angus to return to his original view. When he gave evidence on behalf of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, he was opposed to the power. I hope that there is no one on the Committee who, simply because he happens to represent a rural, agricultural or fishing area, thinks that the power will not be used in his area. Let me disabuse hon. Members of the notion that the power will be used only in Glasgow. It will be used throughout Scotland—in fishing areas, in Perth, in Aylith and in Coupar Angus.

When constituents come to hon. Members' surgeries to complain that their sons, or even their daughters—we are talking about young women as well as young men—have been stopped and searched for no reason and that no offensive weapons have been found, I hope that the hon. Members concerned will have the courage to say "I voted for that in Parliament, so you cannot really expect me to write to the chief constable about it." I see that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) nodding his agreement. However, I have a feeling that in Saturday morning surgeries, face to face
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
with constituents, hon. Members' nods will not be quite so vigorous. I suspect that more expressions of sympathy and understanding will be heard then than we are hearing in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what happens in Edinburgh, Pentlands. If Pentlands is full of people who go about attacking everybody on the street, I am all in favour of the power being introduced for that constituency alone. I still do not want it in Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth. The right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) does not want it nor do my hon. Friends want it in their constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being told that the whole of Scotland is being lumbered with the stop and search power because Edinburgh, Pentlands has the massive problem des-scribed by the Minister—[
	<b>Hon. Members:</b> "Come off it."] That was the Minister's suggestion, not mine. It is a bit much to ask us to accept that.

This clause and clause 2, which I supported, are the parts of the Bill that have caused the greatest concern. Hon. Members will be doing themselves a great disservice if they brush the issue aside lightly and vote for the clause because the Government Whip tells them that they must. There is more at stake than whether the Government win the vote. Not only the Government but the people will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to place it on record that many hon. Members will support this clause without being convinced that it should be part of the law of Scotland. They will support it only to ensure that the Government win the vote, and not because they are convinced that clause 4 will improve

police-public relations or reduce crime in Scotland. I argue that clause 4 should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened closely to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). I heard him—I hope that I quote him correctly—say that he thought that he would win the argument but lose the vote. Conservative Members are still waiting to hear the argument. Nothing that he said convinced me that he had any answer to the problem of the carriage of offensive weapons in Scotland or the way that they were used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed to hear him say that he did not regard it as a problem, and that he thought that the boot was a greater weapon. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should listen to cases going through the Glasgow High Court when it is on circuit, and then come back and tell the Committee that the carrying of offensive weapons and the use of offensive weapons—particularly knives—is not a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member is going to quote me, he should quote me correctly. I did not say that I did not regard the carrying of offensive weapons as a problem. I said the opposite. I said that I regarded the carrying of offensive weapons as a serious problem and I did not underestimate the problem. I think that the record tomorrow or on Thursday will show that that is exactly what I said, and when it is shown that that is what I said, I shall accept the hon. Member's apology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is then even more amazing that the hon. Gentleman did not apply his mind to the question of how to deal with the carriage of offensive weapons. I say to the hon. Gentleman, in all sincerity, that my experience in the courts is that many injuries and much violence are caused by young people unwittingly carrying offensive weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I say "unwittingly", I mean that many of them put such weapons into their pockets as a matter of habit without any particular intention of using them. They have a drink or two. They get into a row and they start a fight. The offensive weapon is pulled out and it is used. This is what we see increasingly in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case it is too late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) says that in that case it is too late. That is precisely why such a provision is vital in the law of Scotland. We are trying to deter those young people from carrying offensive weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One area in which I found myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth was when he called on the Government to ensure that this provision was properly publicised. I support that, because I believe that the way that this provision will work is that young people, who at the moment do not think before they put the knife into their pocket, will begin to realise that there will be a strong possibility, if they are walking down a street, or if they are in certain company, or if they get into trouble, that they will be searched, and that the offensive weapon will be found and they will be punished accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised at the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth about police-community relations. He knows as well as I do that it is the wish of the police to further police-community relations. Indeed, he paid credit to the police forces in Scotland for having done so over the past few years. Yet he seems to suggest to the Committee this morning that the police, by asking for these powers, are deliberately trying to undo all that they have done in that respect over recent years. That is rubbish. The police are trying to protect innocent people in society from the use of offensive weapons in crimes of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asks "What proof is there? Where are the figures to show that the carrying or use of offensive weapons is increasing?" I cannot give him general figures, but I would remind him that the chief constable of Lothian and Borders, in his recent report, pointed to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the deteriorating situation concerning the carrying of offensive weapons."</p></blockquote>
The figures that he produced for his region showed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1979, 195 persons were convicted of such offences compared to 138 in 1978, an increase of 41 per cent."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that the complacency of the hon. Gentleman's remarks can be justified in any way on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has referred to the chief constable's report I wonder whether he will comment on another section of the report which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although my officers' previous knowledge of individuals might strongly suggest that a person is likely to be in possession of an offensive weapon, they are not entitled to search such persons to establish the truth of their reasonable suspicions."</p></blockquote>
Is it the hon. Gentleman's view that the mere knowledge that someone has a previous conviction would justify reasonable suspicion for a search under the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding of the clause, which seems to be the understanding of the Minister, judging from his speech of the other day, is that knowledge of previous convictions would not be sufficient to enable a search to take place under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the chief constable's point is that he is concerned. That same paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am concerned that society is not being properly protected as I am convinced that a person prepared to carry an offensive weapon is, in certain circumstances, prepared to use it."</p></blockquote>
We are not just talking about the rights of individuals not to be searched when they walk the streets. We are also talking about the rights of individuals to walk the streets without being stabbed. The point about the victim is constantly being ignored by the Opposition. The protection of the citizen is a duty of the Government and this House of Commons and the proposals in the clause are designed to protect the citizen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said in his speech that the police supported this measure. Yes, the police do support the measure, but I was interested to note that the two bodies quoted by the hon. Gentleman in the early stages of the Bill were not mentioned by him. Those bodies are the Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland and both support the provision. On the strength of the arguments produced by the hon. Gentleman on the basis of their reports during the earlier stages of the Bill I should have thought that at least he would have taken some account of their opinions on this matter as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is essential to the Bill because our duty is to be able to assure the people of this country that we can provide them with protection from violence in the streets
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
and in their homes. The clause goes a long way towards providing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) said, we all feel it incumbent on us to protect the citizen. We have also to keep in mind the protection of the citizen in so far as his rights as a free man are concerned. That seems to be the tightrope we walk in the Committee. We have to keep a balance between the need for the protection of society from violence and the need to see that there is no erosion of civil liberties. I certainly reject the suggestions made earlier that concern with the protection of the citizen is confined to one side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One chief constable has been quoted but there is also the statement made by the chief constable of Aberdeen about the whole Bill, although I freely concede that he made no particular reference to clause 4. It seems that any benefit that may arise from the clause will be heavily outweighed by the bad feeling that may be engendered. The fact that the Scottish Council on Crime laid down a trial period of five years seems to indicate its apprehension of the hazards in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to see the matter of the serious nature of crimes of violence reflected in the sentences of the courts rather than by giving these indiscriminate powers to the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have sought to intervene. I have sat with increasing impatience and distaste listening to the long, tedious and intellectually inadequate arguments that have come from the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I intervened in the Second Reading debate, I said that I did so with some diffidence. Having heard the arguments advanced in our long sittings so far, I feel now that perhaps that diffidence was misplaced. It was said of John Stuart Mill that it was not so much that he was a mountain but that the surrounding countryside was flat. From this vantage point, the countryside opposite is as flat as the North Sea on a calm day, but certainly not as deep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the lesson of the North Sea oil search that if oil is not struck quickly, stop boring has not been learned on the Opposition Benches. It is no acci-

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept the Opposition's compliments? We on this side of the Committee would like him to know that we are very glad indeed to have heard the result of six weeks of total silence and thought from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I am grateful to the hon. Member for his intervention, although I cannot think that it adds much to the debate. We have had from him only long speeches and occasional entirely bogus claims that the Minister has made a great concession, but what has happened is that the scales of incomprehension have occasionally fallen from the eyes of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). If it is true that there are none so blind as they who will not see, it is also true that there are none so deaf as they who will not stop talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) on this occasion. He has been treading a tightrope, because it is well known that the parliamentary SNP is split down the middle on this issue. During the Committee stage of the Labour Government's Bill, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that the carrying of weapons has reached a stage where it behoves us as legislators to give the police additional powers to try to curb the practice."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25 January 1979; c.71–72.]</p></blockquote>
Perhaps it is no coincidence that instead of being on this Committee, the hon. Member for Dundee, East is walking down the promenade with an independence air, and one can hear them all declare "Is that no' Jim Sillars there?" It was interesting to hear the contribution of the right hon. Member for Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much talk of civil rights during this debate, and I feel that lessons in the liberty of the individual lie ill in the mouths of the Opposition whose Socialist philosophy is dedicated to the elimination of many of our freedoms of individual choice and individual enterprise. We see and hear their rantings in Opposition, we experienced their impovering oppression when they were in Government. They threatened us with Armageddon and called
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
it Utopia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Civil rights is not an absolute or immutable code. It must change and be updated as circumstances change. Looking back over the last 100 years, one can see any number of new inventions and developments that have impinged on civil rights and led to changes. One can cite the railways, the penny post, the camera, the telephone, the radio wave and many others. I think that further change is now needed because of changing circumstances in our society. One of the important civil rights—to which Opposition Members have made little reference—is to have freedom from assault on the person or property and freedom to walk in peace in our streets confident of freedom from assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous debate on the Labour Government's Bill, the then hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, now, happily, my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman at least accept that even where there is violent crime, it may not be a permanent phenomenon? In the late 1960s there was severe student unrest in France and America. It has now virtually disappeared, and in 10 or 20 years it will have gone completely. But once these provisions are on the statute book, they will be permanent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman should wait to hear what I am about to say. I was about to quote my hon. and learned Friend who, in January 1979, drew attention to the horrifying rising statistics. He spoke of the rising trend of crime, and said that in 1977 500 people were seriously assaulted, 50 of whom died. Clause 4 could reverse that terrible toll of human life and happiness. If it failed totally to reverse it but diminished it by only 1 per cent., it would be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the other argument that we have heard over and over again. It was rehearsed yet again today by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing)—that this clause will harm police relations with the public. I believe that if we leave a situation where police are demonstrably losing the battle against violent crime on the grounds that the public would be upset if police were to be given powers to improve their chance of reducing crime, is turning the argument on its head. It is Orwellian double-speak
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
of a sinister kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Police relations with the public can improve only as their efforts to stamp out violent crime succeed. The relative adjustment that is proposed in the clause is dictated by common sense. We have heard many references by my hon. Friends to the anomalous comparison between what is now being proposed—or opposed—in this clause and the position that obtains in the case of birds' eggs, drugs, firearms and other matters. Bailies can search for salmon or for fishing tackle. They can search for game out of season and for protected game. The police can stop and search a motorist's bloodstream for an offensive level of alcohol. The Law Society voted in support of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People have to give police the opportunity to test the level of alcohol in their blood when driving cars. That was introduced to have a deterrent effect. Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that the deterrent effect of that legislation is lessening and has almost disappeared? Drunken driving cases are increasing because the initial deterrent effect has ceased. That is exactly what will happen here. This clause may have some short-term effect that will later fade away to nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is part of the argument and it would be a negative approach to the matter. Certainly there may be a deterrent aspect, but what is more important is the realistic specific power that is given to try to reduce the level of crime and the carrying of dangerous weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society recently voted in support of random breath tests. It is interesting that the Law Society supports clause 4 of the Bill which does not have a random content. The Thomson Committee supported this clause, the Scottish Council on Crime supports the clause, and I am convinced that the great majority of Scottish people support it. It has my unreserved support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been discussing this morning the winning of the argument and the losing of the vote. I am sure that I speak for all my colleagues on this side of the House when I say that we are delighted that some hon. Members opposite have decided to join in the argument. We look forward to hearing a
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
great deal from them in the next few weeks. We have been waiting for the past six weeks but at last perhaps we can hear what they have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the Government are concerned, the argument has been lost in the country. Those of us on this side of the Committee who have been engaged in public meetings on the Criminal Justice Bill have had that forcibly brought home to us by the size of the audiences. Only last week I addressed a meeting, along with Mrs. Margo MacDonald and Mr. James Milne of the STUC. Over 200 young people packed the Cumbernauld theatre. That is a measure of the concern that is felt by young people about measures of the kind effected in clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My searches in the report of the Thomson committee have not confirmed that the committee had anything to say on this matter beyond the reference in paragraph 3.19, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are aware that one of the problems relating to a power to detain on suspicion, and particularly a power to search for weapons, is a fear that this will lead to police harassment of young persons, particularly where such persons have a police record."</p></blockquote>
I am reading this in the hope that the Solicitor-General is hearing what I am saying because I know how interested he is in the criminal procedures in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can hear exactly what the hon. Member is saying: nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the honourable Lord Thomson was somebody. I should have thought that if the honourable Lord Thomson wrote paragraph 3.19, the Solicitor-General would have wanted to have heard what Lord Thomson had to say. But apparently that is not so. Nevertheless I shall continue because other people are interested in what Lord Thomson said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some may think that such harassment would be a small price to pay for any reduction in the number of assaults with weapons committed by young persons but apart from anything else there is a grave risk that any harassment would be counter-productive in the long run, since it would lead to increased antagonism to the police."</p></blockquote>
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang). He appears to take quite a different view from Lord Thomson, but I believe we have to pay regard to the authoritative view. However, a memorandum by the Scottish Council on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
Crime, "Crime and the Prevention of Crime" stated in paragraph 90:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that the weight of the arguments is in favour of the granting to the police of a power of search of persons in public places for offensive weapons. In addition, we consider that there would be considerable advantage in the statutory power of search being introduced for a trial period of perhaps five years which would enable the effectiveness of the power for the reduction of crimes of violence and its effect on police-public relationships to be assessed."</p></blockquote>
We have lost that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Won the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) says, we have won the argument on that point, but have lost the vote. There are those of us who will seek to reintroduce that on Report and I believe that we will receive representations from the country about it. Therefore it is important that we have as assessment of the powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the acid test will be the reduction—if there is to be one—in the incidence of crimes of violence. I do not consider that we have heard enough about crimes of violence—what they are and how they originate and I do not consider that as a society we know enough about the causes of crimes of violence. However, we know that many such crimes occur in the domestic environment and often, unfortunately, in the marriage environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that we should do more as a society to establish the causes of crime rather than to deal with this matter superficially as the Bill does. I hope that we can overcome that in the future because many of us will be arguing for far greater research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many crimes of violence do not involve weapons and I do not feel that we have discussed that enough. Often fists are used, as are feet. We hear increasingly of people being kicked. I agree entirely with the views expressed by my hon. Friend on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon.

Friend has said or to treat it as a kind of "Round Britain Quiz"? If he knows the answers to such questions it is his responsibility to tell us so that we can weigh the evidence, not to make such nonsensical "Mastermind" interventions. Is it not the truth that the Government have the duty to show that the powers of search would have had any effect in any of those murders that he mentions? I think it is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say something about what weapons may be. Again, perhaps the Solicitor-General for Scotland will be able to give us statistics. I understand that there is widespread use of everyday instruments. We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) the story of a paper knife in the possession of an Opposition Member and the problems that caused on board an aircraft. I understand that items such as combs, tumblers and bottles can be used as offensive weapons. I do not believe that this clause will deal with that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
problem. If it does, we look forward to hearing in what way it does so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The numbers caught by the power of the clause would, I think, represent a minority of those carrying weapons. Again, I want to see the value of the clause, if it has any value, and how it will operate as a deterrent. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) pointed out, we already have similar provisions with regard to drugs and drinking and driving, and there is considerable evidence that those laws are losing ground against the rising incidence of such offences. Breathalyser testing was successful at the beginning, but it was also accompanied by propaganda. A great deal was said about it in the media, and a great deal of information was put out by the Government of the day. Television carried much information on how it would operate, and it undoubtedly had considerable success. But that is already diminishing, and there is some evidence to suggest that people are now prepared to take the risk of breaking the law. We are moving back to the former state of affairs, because the value of the publicity has worn off. I believe that that would happen with clause 4. In the early days, it may well reduce the numbers carrying offensive weapons, but in the end I think that we would lose ground again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case against the clause is mainly the deterioration that will occur in police-public relations. To return to my first point, that was the overwhelming argument put by the young people whom I addressed in the Cumbernauld theatre last week. They made the point that it would cause a further deterioration in police-public relations and cause harassment of young people by the police, which would be very unhelpful to the community as a whole. I am convinced that that is so. That is why I most certainly do not support the inclusion of clause 4 in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of hon. Members have questioned the publicity for the powers that the Bill includes. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said that the matter was important from his point of view. It was the recommendation of the Scottish Council on Crime. I am happy to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) that it is the Government's intention that, once
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
the Bill has been approved by Parliament, considerable publicity will be given in particular to clause 4 but also to the clauses concerning the carrying of alcohol at football matches and the specific offence of vandalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly we will welcome any suggestions from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee about other provisions of the Bill that they may consider worthy of similar publicity. We are at the moment working on the details of how the aim could best be achieved. But I am happy to give the Committee that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the Under-Secretary has thought about this matter. Could he give us a little more detail about what form the publicity will take? Is he thinking of a poster campaign, for example, or leaflets?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In what terms will reasonable suspicion be defined for the public? Members of the public will want to know in what circumstances they are likely to be searched. Could the Under-Secretary tell us what the definition will be, in public terms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The publicity campaign will not, of course, amount to a three-month session on the law of Scotland. There are other means of informing, on that level, those who are sufficiently interested. Our aim would be, through the possibilities of mass publicity, to bring home to those most likely to be affected by the clauses the likelihood of their being searched if a police officer has reasonable grounds for suspicion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened to the earlier debates he would appreciate that the Bill has not the slightest effect on definitions of offensive weapons. The Bill makes no change to what constitutes an offensive weapon. As the publicity will be directed towards acquainting those who might be affected by them with changes in the law, it would not be

appropriate for me to go into any detail about the law as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked whether the publicity will take the form of posters or leaflets. That is something that will be worked on. We will be anxious to ensure that we choose the form that is most likely to make youngsters—and their parents, who often have influence over what their children do in the evenings—aware of the law and the risks they will run if they carry objects of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) expressed anxiety in reaction to the Under-Secretary's point about publicity. Presumably the publicity will say something like this: "Don't carry offensive weapons. If you do, you will be searched. If you are found carrying something, you will be punished". Surely the point is that such publicity will encourage the police to believe that they have power to behave in that way. Presumably the police will be told by the Under-Secretary that they must not search unless suspicion has crystallised upon a particular individual. In other words, the instructions given to the police will differ from the teaching given to the community—which includes the police—about the general effect of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that no poster or any other form of publicity will give the public or anyone else any misleading definition of the law. It is not for posters to interpret the law. Indeed, it is not for Ministers to interpret the law. Once Parliament has approved the clause, the courts interpret the law. As has often been said—by Labour Members as much as by anyone else—while ministerial interpretations of what Governments intend the law to be may clarify matters for purposes of debate, it is what is in the clause, as approved by Parliament, that matters. I am sure that I carry the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) with me on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot continually give way to hon. Gentlemen. This is only one small point in the debate to which I am to reply. I emphasise that the details of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
publicity scheme are being worked out at the moment. It will not be the intention of any publicity to mislead the public about the purpose of the law. That has never been the case in the past and there is no reason why it should be so in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members commented on the incidence of the carrying of offensive weapons. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) pointed out how in Lothian and Borders there is evidence of an increase of some 41 per cent. over the past year in the carrying of offensive weapons. In Scotland overall, 1,409 people were convicted of offences involving the carrying of offensive weapons in 1969. By 1979 the figure had risen to 2,037. Throughout those 10 years there was a slow but steady increase in the incidence of this form of offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bounden on the Committee, and indeed on all responsible people, to seek to respond to this problem. I was somewhat disappointed that the Opposition, although explaining their concern about this provision, had not brought forward any other proposals, amendments or suggestions for achieving any effective way of reducing the problem, although I am glad to see that they recognise it as being important, as do the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Minister agree that the statistics he produced are merely the tip of the iceberg? It may be a small tip because of the difficulties in apprehending people carrying offensive weapons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. Those are the statistics of people who have been found to be carrying offensive weapons; they do not relate to the overall size of the problem, which can only be speculated on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) quite correctly pointed out the very wide powers that police already have in relation to other objects that may be carried. The example of birds' eggs has often been used. But drugs are perhaps far more relevant to the circumstances that we are facing at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I indicate the effect that that provision has had in Scotland and the extent to which the police have used that power. In many respects it is similar to the power that is now proposed for the police in respect of offensive weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
The matter that has most concerned Opposition Members in regard to stop and search has been whether the police would use those powers, irrespective of what the Bill says, in a random way to harass members of the public, whether large numbers of the public, who themselves are not carrying weapons, would find themselves being stopped, and whether the police would be abusing the power provided for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last year for which we have the final figure on drugs is 1978, when the number of stop searches was 1,339. Drugs were recovered in no fewer than 702 cases—52 per cent. Unless we are suggesting that 52 per cent. of the public carry drugs—which is obviously nonsense; only a small proportion of the total population would be carrying drugs—it emphasises that the police, clearly, were being very selective indeed about the persons they were searching to find drugs. People who carry drugs regularly do not necessarily carry them all the time. Therefore, it by no means follows that even those who were not found to be carrying drugs on that occasion were not persons who, on other occasions, had done so. The fact remains that in that year more than half the people that the police stopped to search were found to be carrying drugs and were, therefore, charged with the relevant offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we think of the small proportion of the total population who are likely to be carrying drugs at any one time, it surely emphasises beyond any serious question that the police were being very selective. They were not simply stopping people at random. They were stopping those who they clearly had reasonable cause to believe might be carrying drugs at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point that the Minister has made in respect of Scotland. Would he not also accept that drug abuse generally is not the problem in Scotland that it is in certain parts of England and Wales, particularly in the South-East and London? Would the Minister give us more specific statistics on the south-east of England, where this is much more of a problem, in the same way as he has done for Scotland? The carrying of offensive weapons may be more of a problem than drug abuse in Scotland. Therefore, we shall get the same sort of abuse of police power of search that appears to be taking place, particularly in London, for drug abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We anticipated that the Committee might be interested in comparable figures south of the border. We consulted the Home Office, which contacted Scotland Yard. Unfortunately, comparable figures are not available. Therefore, I do not have figures to give to the hon. Gentleman of the situation in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman has inadvertently put forward a powerful argument in favour of what I am trying to say. He has correctly pointed out how the incidence of drug carrying in Scotland is very much less than in other parts of the country. In other words, the likely number of people in Scotland who are carrying drugs at any given time is infinitely smaller—in the hon. Gentleman's view, which I share—than elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Yet, despite that, in the 1,300 cases in 1978 when the police stopped and searched people whom they suspected of carrying drugs no fewer than 52 per cent, were found to be carrying drugs at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise, and the hon. Gentleman's point gives added weight to this, that in the case of drugs, which we all agree is the most relevant comparison that we can make—birds' eggs do not take us very far on this issue—the police have been shown to be using their power in Scotland, and it is only Scotland that we are discussing at the moment, in a most responsible fashion, and in a fashion which has clearly been publicly welcomed and supported. There is no reason to believe that the police would wish to use the power under clause 4 any differently from the way that they use the existing power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have pointed out, these proposals emanate from the recommendations of the Scottish Council on Crime, and are supported by both the Law Society and the Faculty of Advocates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we shall have to deal with it at greater length. The Minister talks about the comparison with drugs and asks us to see an analogy between drugs and offensive weapons. Drugs are carried by people who intend to use them. The argument put forward about search is that a person who carries a knife carelessly, without intending to use it, but who may use it, is therefore not carrying an offensive weapon. In other words, drugs are carried in order to be used with a group of people,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
who, with their contacts, are in any case largely known to the police in connection with the drug trade. The offensive weapon could be one which even the Government Whip found himself carrying. There is no analogy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be a bit fairer on this occasion than he seems to wish to be. If we had not produced any comparable evidence, the hon. Gentleman would be the first to stand up and say "Here we have a power in the case of drugs, which if the Government thought the evidence supported them, they would undoubtedly have provided for the benefit of the Committee." Now that the Government have provided the evidence, the hon. Gentleman does not like the evidence, because it does not support his argument, so he puts forward a phoney and artificial explanation as to why it is not really comparable and suggests that we should not look at drugs and it would be more appropriate to concentrate on birds' eggs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that in both cases, what is proposed is a power which the police already have in the case of drugs. Where they have reasonable cause to believe that certain objects are being carried, they can search people to see whether their suspicions are justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot comment on the position in England and Wales, because I do not know the facts. The power in clause 4 is a Scottish provision which does not apply to England and Wales. Therefore we are concerned only with how the Scottish police are likely to use the proposed powers of search, which are almost identical to those which they have for drugs. It has often been suggested that the Scottish police have used their powers abusively when searching for drugs. But they can only search people who they have reasonable cause to believe are carrying drugs and they clearly use their powers in a responsible and acceptable manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we accept that. There is therefore no basic reason to argue that although the police use their existing wide powers reasonably and responsibly in the case of drugs, they will not do so if given similar powers in the case of offensive weapons. Offensive
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
weapons are a much more serious problem to the wellbeing of the community than drugs, although drugs themselves are very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of seriousness, obviously offensive weapons which can lead to the maiming or death of the victim are more serious. Therefore, if Parliament has, rightly and responsibly, given these powers to the police, who in Scotland have acted and used them responsibly in the case of drugs, there is no sound reason why we should be overtly worried as to how the poilce might use similar powers in the case of offensive weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has the benefit of such evidence as is available. The evidence supports the view that the Government are putting forward, and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West again, when faced with evidence, says "One can never make comparisons." The evidence which is given, is never relevant to the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, unless it happens to support his argument. That is not a responsible way to conduct the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals have the support of the Scottish Council on Crime. They have been welcomed by the Law Society and the Faculty of Advocates. I have no doubt that they are welcomed by the majority of the Scottish public, who understand that the power will be used reasonably. I think that the Committee now accepts that it is not a random power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, after this lengthy debate, which began long before the Recess, the Committee will be able to come to a conclusion as to the desirability of the clause, so that we can proceed to consider the other parts of the Bill. The matter was also dealt with fully under the previous Government's Bill, because of Opposition amendments. I hope we can now come to a conclusion on it in order that both Parliament and the public may be aware of the Committee's views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore that thoroughly unworthy intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) said that within civil liberties there was no fixed point. There is a shifting balance between the conflicting interests in society. There has been an appalling increase in crimes involving offensive weapons in Scotland in the past decade. The statistics for the past few years indicate that the increase is accelerating. The figures for Lothian have been mentioned. In Strathclyde, the number of persons found carrying offensive weapons rose from 1,086 to 1,222 in the past year. It is a serious increase which is continuing. Faced with that problem, it is now necessary, albeit at an uncomfortable time, for a shift in the balance to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only substantial argument advanced by the Opposition—I give them credit for not being complacent about the increase in crimes involving offensive weapons—is that this measure will affect relations between the police and the public. That is a delicate matter that must be regarded with the greatest care at all times, but the argument cannot be pushed too far. To do so would lead to the conclusion that all traffic offences, for example, must be dismantled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no doubt that nothing brought about a more substantial alteration in the relationship between the community and the police than the introduction of traffic regulations, which we all, I am sure, believe to be essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a number of indications of substantial support for this measure from the Law Society and the Faculty of Advocates. I concede readily that I have received a number of representations from the public in Scotland expressing disquiet over the detention provisions in the Bill, but although I have said publicly that I will support the measure, I have not had one representation suggesting that it is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was persuaded especially by a Queen's
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
Counsel in Scotland who at one time stood as the Labour candidate for Inverness—Mr. Donald Macaulay. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will probably recognise that he is one of the most experienced and skilful QCs in Scotland. If the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) wants to hold a public meeting and to have it explained to young people why it is necessary to introduce these powers, he should contact Mr. Macaulay, who time and again has advanced the valid argument that, but for the carrying of offensive weapons, incidents that would normally result in nothing more than an appearance in the sheriff court or, more likely, the district court, have led to the death or serious maiming of young persons. In one instance a man's future life was in ruins because of the seriousness of the offence that he had committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a habit to be broken and a balance to be maintained. Given what has happened over the past decade, there must be a shift towards greater powers for the police to search for offensive weapons. I do not discuss these matters lightly, and I do not support the measure without thought, but with the grave problem that arises from the carrying of offensive weapons in Scotland, the extension of police powers is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been told that this matter has been discussed for an extremely long time and that we should shortly be coming to a decision. It has been discussed for an even longer time than the Minister knows. However, as I have tried to demonstrate, the Minister does not know this measure or the previous Bill very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue was first raised in the late 1960s when I was an Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. The then Opposition mounted a brutal, vulgar and crude law and order campaign for political purposes. That was how the concept of search first came to be discussed, among other matters, by the Scottish Council on Crime, and Brief references were made in the Thomson report. The issue was first raised by the present hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) as a piece of crude politicking. I believe that in his quieter moments he would accept that to be his general position in criminal, as in political, matters. The political success of objectives can be measured by votes gained. It is an issue that has no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
respectable origin. It was a crude piece of law and order politicking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments which have been adduced for this provision, which have given rise to its appearing in a Government Bill, have been based on the same premise. The Minister has tried to tell us that the clause is designed only to deal with the individual in circumstances in which suspicion has crystallised upon that individual, but all the arguments are unrelated to that approach. The Minister's arguments, the seamier arguments of the hon. Member for Southend, East and the arguments of the Solicitor-General for Scotland a year ago have not been based and were not based on that premise. The arguments for the power to search have always been based upon the value of using it in two ways — first, as a deterrent and, secondly, in a random fashion. The first use has its effectiveness in the second. In other words, something approaching random search brought about the deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) referred to a lack of intellectual content in the speeches of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing)—which I reject completely. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would apply his own intellect and his own reasoning to this issue. Any lack of intellectual content has been shown to be a crude political move. The arguments for random search have now been brought in aid for a measure which is claimed to be related specifically to the crystallising of suspicion on a particular individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister does not know his Bill especially well. There was a most revealing moment last week when we were discussing the relationship of the Bill to the 1953 Act. We discovered that the Minister did not know the 1953 Act. He said that it had to satisfy three very narrow criteria. That is not true. He said that the first criterion was the carrying of offensive weapons in a public place. That is no narrow criterion but a major and wide one. It is precisely the reason for all the discussion. That is the parameter of the problem. It is not to give powers of immediate search into a private, domestic home. It is precisely to deal with the problem in public places. Therefore the Minister is wrong in saying that this is a particularly narrow criterion inhibiting the application of the 1953 Act. On the contrary, the precise circumstance for
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
which the 1953 Act was brought in was its use in a public place. Therefore the Minister was wrong there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act has not three criteria but two. The Minister misread and misunderstood his own Bill, as his intervention showed, when he thought that the two other criteria referred to were two that were necessary instead of two that were alternatives. He said that the second matter that was inhibiting the application of the 1953 Act was that it had to be applied only in a situation in which a constable was not satisfied with a person's identity or place of residence and—this is the third matter it had to satisfy—that it was necessary to arrest the person in order to prevent him committing any other offence. It is just not true. These were alternatives. It is a broadening of the Act which could be used in circumstances in which the arrest could be made if the constable did not know the person's identity or place of residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a pretty wide criterion. Most constables do not know these names and addresses, they may not be satisfied with the answers they are given and can use the Act. The Act does not have three criteria but two. I emphasise that because the Minister was unaware or wrong and even after 10 sittings in discussion of this problem he still had it wrong at our last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are suspicious of the clause, first, because of its genesis in the seamier side of Glasgow politics; secondly, because of the arguments that have been adduced in its favour; thirdly, because the Minister in charge of the Bill got it wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to look at the general arguments that have been put forward for this. In passing, I wish to say that it is not enough simply to call in aid some of the support which we are told is adduced for the clause. I refer specifically to the Law Society of Scotland. It is true that this body came down in favour of the clause but it is equally true that it had very grave anxieties about the clause, so much so that when it came to a vote on its council it was a 15–13 vote. That is hardly an overwhelming endorsement. If the problem is such that it unites all six advocates offices it certainly does not seem that there is great conviction in the legal profession that the clause is necessary. I accept that there is great conviction in the Tory Party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>a</i>) become guilty of obstructing the constable. The benefits achieved by these powers being conferred would, in the view of the minority, be exceeded by the disadvantages."</p></blockquote>
I stress this in order to show two things—first, that the calling in aid of the legal profession is by no means a solid weapon. Up to now there have been grave reservations and even now only a tiny majority actually support it. Secondly, such is the strength of feeling that the Law Council felt it necessary to spell out in detail the view of the minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the Opposition's views and we are right to hold those views. We are right to be suspicious of the Minister's assurances, especially with the background of his own ignorance of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953, but also because of the statements that have been made in the past in support of such a measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we study those statements we shall come to the conclusion that the arguments and the law for which they were arguing is not the law which the Minister claims he is implementing. The Minister made it clear—we have spelt it out in the past—that it dealt with the weight of suspicion that must accrete round an individual. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden used the words "crystallise upon an individual".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that was not the argument that was adduced for bringing in this power. The law that is being debated is a different law from what the Minister claims this clause provides. We should therefore ask whether the Minister has changed his views and introduced something else, in which case the Bill itself should be changed. If that is the position, this power of search should be scrapped because that rejects the arguments for which it was proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have massive evidence on this. We have had evidence today in the form of statistics. I regret saying this to the Solicitor-General for Scotland. He was a good Minister when I took individual constituency cases to him. He was as good as any other Solicitor-General I have known in responding to particular points and recognising general indications. He acted well, but I must say that he has had an alter ego on this Committee. He has not helped us and I wish he would.

duced figures, such as the 500 cases last year and the 60 that he mentioned in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). But we want the facts. I may reject some of the conclusions but I am in favour of the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the criminal statistics, the method by which murder or culpable homicide was committed is not separated. In my experience in the High Court the overwhelming majority of murders are committed with an offensive weapon illegally carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall attempt to obtain from my officials in the Crown Office for the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), the precise number of indictments for murder, attempted murder and the like, committed with offensive weapons for the latest year. But it is undoubtedly true that in the past few years at least 50 people a year in Scotland have been murdered with a knife improperly carried. If that figure is not thought to be accurate, my researches will prove it to be so. I can think of only one murder case in which I have appeared in the last 20 years in which an offensive weapon was not used. That was a case in which a woman was charged with strangling her husband with a stocking and was found not guilty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, we are not discussing that. How many of these were domestic matters? In how many of these cases were the famous words "He came at me, I picked up a knife and he ran on to it" used? The Minister must show that the powers of search are so integrated with this that they will solve the problem. He has proved nothing by what he has said so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point and I share my hon. Friend's view of the Minister's helpfulness when he can help. I am surprised that he does not have the statistics because they were given on 30 January during discussion of the previous Bill. They showed that, in 1978, of the 57 reported murders six were committed using a blunt instrument, 22 using a sharp instrument, one by shooting, and the balance of 28 or 29 by strangulation or asphyxiation or by hitting or kicking. The 1978 statistics are on record. I am astonished that no Minister has been able to give them to the Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
mittee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statistics show that 50 per cent. of the murders reported are committed by using a blunt or a sharp instrument. The remaining 50 per cent. that will not be covered by these powers are committed by asphyxiation or strangulation. Those statistics are in column 132 of the Committee proceedings of the previous Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try, in the curious way we have of behaving in our Committees in this Parliament, to look at reports of the proceedings as I go on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to take up the figures that my hon. Friend gave. I am astonished that the figures for murder should be used in support of the Bill. If I were a Minister or Law Officer I would give figures not for murder but for serious assault or serious crime. Murder is often a by-product of violence rather than the intention. The more serious figures are of the larger number of assaults caused by weapons. If the Government wish to use that argument it is up to them, but it does seem to have shaken their case considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now have the figures. In column 132 of 
	<i>Hansard</i> of 30 January 1979 there is reference to crime statistics. In the 1978 statistics, use of a sharp weapon was 22, blunt instruments 6 and asphyxiation and strangulation and other methods 26. We may accept that that is a microcosm of other assaults but, on the whole, methods used to murder are not necessarily different from other crimes. By accepting that, we show that the powers of search are very limited, if effective at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those figures, only the 22 where a sharp instrument was used out of a total of about 60 cases would have any relevance. The blunt instrument is picked up. It could be a brick or a boot. It would not be something that is generally carried to be used, certainly by the non-professional criminal. As regards strangulation, I am carrying my tie, which is a ligature of a kind. So it is nonsense and the case does not stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that the case never has stood. The arguments have been based on the premise that serious violent crime is a bad thing but if we found the knife beforehand it would stop its being used. It might not stop the murder, assault or serious damage, but it would stop the assault by that weapon. But there is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
connection because there is no proof of crystallisation of suspicion forming on a person. If there were, other action could not be taken under the 1953 Act or under other legislation relating to detention. I object to detention, but if anything has made nonsense of clause 4 and its powers it is the earlier clause that allows detention after bringing a person to a police station and searching him. It makes no kind of sense. Therefore, we have to look for reasons why it has been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason is that the Government believe that there is political advantage to be gained. Their arguments today have shown that they believe there to be political advantage in showing themselves as the party of law and order. Those who criticise their methods can then be branded as being against law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have news for the Government. We are opposed to these proposals precisely because we are in favour of law and order. We believe that their application will lead not to fewer incidents but to more. I shall give one or two examples of how that could happen in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument adduced relates to the incidence of the carrying of offensive weapons. A comparison has been made with the carrying of drugs. I rejected the analogy with drugs not merely because the Minister claimed that the figures did not support my argument. I am not as mean-minded as that. I am open to persuasion. That is what we are here for. I rejected the analogy because it was not a proper analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to learn that approximately 50 per cent. of those searched—700 out of 1300, or whatever the exact figure was—were carrying drugs. Facts are always useful. However, isolated facts do not necessarily point to an analogy unless other factors are involved. They are not necessarily admissible as evidence in arguments about other issues. I am interested in the figures but I reject the analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is very little use of that power in Scotland. It was used on only 1300 occasions and on 700 of those occasions the suspicions proved correct. That would not be the case with offensive weapons. It was not the case when the Government Whip was found to be carrying a paper knife on an aircraft, which caused him some embarrassment. All of us wear ties,
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
which could be used as ligatures with which strangulations could be carried out. Offensive weapons cannot be detected from someone's appearance. One cannot usually see them in people's pockets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drugs community, on the other hand, is in general known; the contacts, the milieu and the circumstances of its members' lives are known. There is a special unit to deal with drug offences in Scotland, although on a much smaller scale than that for London. When such powers are used on a wider scale there are continual complaints about police harassment. That does not happen much in Scotland at present because the power is not used broadly or at random. That is the first reason why the analogy is not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, those who are professionally involved with the drugs community, such as aftercare workers, community workers and various social workers, tell a rather different story. While the figure of 1300 searches shows that there is no general random harassment, all those involved with the victims of the drugs scene assert that there is harassment of that particular group. As police constables become specialists they become involved in carrying out such searches and harassment takes place. If the social workers are right in making such assertions about drug searches, which have been cited as a comparison with offensive weapons searches, that will have a wider application to the arguments that have been used in support of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with large numbers of young people who may get into trouble on Friday and Saturday nights, large numbers of young people in dance halls and in pubs in the cities, drinking alcohol on Friday and Saturday nights. That is a much wider community than the small known community involved with drugs. If those professionally concerned with the drugs community are right in their assertions of harassment, it follows as the night the day that the clause will lead to an extension of such harassment into a wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More dangers will be attached, too. The harassment complained about by people who are in a sense part of a closed group is something that they often have to learn to live with. It happens frequently, and such people know that often it is their way of life that gives rise to harassment. They may complain, and their social workers may complain. They all dislike it,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
but they can live with it. It does not in general spark off a troublesome response. It does in London; I accept that, and for the same reason. The group susceptible to harassment is being widened to include half our population, excluding only old bodies like me, obviously incapable of carrying a hatchet. I have tennis elbow too, which would of itself no doubt save me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who adduce the second argument do so because they are in favour of law and order. We say that that will break down relationships of law and order between the police and the community, especially the young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much by way of preliminary remarks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has had the Floor for 25 minutes. This is a stand part debate, but obviously we cannot spend the whole day on this clause. The hon. Gentleman has been rather wide and repetitious in his arguments. I therefore ask him to be more specific in his objections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to my critics. If I have been very wide, I regret it. I thought that I was sticking very closely to the subject in my preliminary remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to deal with the main arguments that have been adduced for the clause. I will deal with the first point I made 20 minutes ago. I said that there were three points and I wish to deal with the arguments for this provision adduced previously by present members of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was tempted to go back through the newspaper files, and to quote the speeches by the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) from 
	<i>Hansard</i> and from the 
	<i>Daily Express</i> particularly in that period—1968 and 1969—on this major campaign on police powers of search. However, it is sufficient to go back only one year to look at the arguments that have been brought in by the Conservative Party and to go no further than the present Solicitor-General for Scotland. He said that the law was too narrow:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The law, as it is now says that a constable must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is carrying an offensive weapon. In other words, he has to be certain in his suspicion before he can search."—[
	<i>Official Report, first Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c.60.]</p></blockquote>
That is a very interesting phrase: "certain in his suspicion". Perhaps the Solicitor-General might define the differ-
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
ence between suspicion, certainty and the certainty in suspicion, because I should like to know. He then gave the example of someone regarded as a trouble-maker, but whom the police were unable to search because of what the Conservatives saw as the inhibitions in the 1953 Act. That was the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Solicitor-General for Scotland went on to exemplify that in column 62. At that time the Conservatives buttressed their arguments with the phrase "may be carrying a weapon" rather than "is carrying a weapon". He defended that at great length in column after column. That is in line with the arguments that have been adduced for this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our amendment says 'may be carrying a weapon' which is not the same. For instance, if a constable came across young Donnie Dewar and on 10 previous occasions he had been convicted of running about the streets with a knife, he would have no grounds for suspicion whatsoever that Donnie Dewar was carrying a knife, and therefore was committing an offence. But he would have very good grounds for suspecting that he may be carrying' a knife. That is the distinction, and the important one."—[
	<i>Official Report, first Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c.62.]</p></blockquote>
We are clear that the clause was modified to allow the extension of suspicion in relation not to that incident but to the previous character of the person in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his next argument the Solicitor-General described the dance hall. The Tory Party is obsessed with dance halls. I have never known a party so obsessed with dance halls. If they are right about the sinfulness that there is in these dance halls, they take an inordinate pleasure in recalling them. I cannot wait to see the Solicitor-General doing the tango—whether in Paris or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General gave the example of an incident in a dance hall. What the blazes do the Government know about dance halls? It is a curious picture. Has the Solicitor-General or the Under-Secretary ever been in a Glasgow dance hall?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was once not allowed into a dance hall in Glasgow because I was not wearing a tie. Mind you, I was very young at the time. I suppose if I had been wearing a tie I might have strangled someone. It would have been an offensive weapon. But those are things that are criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General said, when moving the amendment:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is an incident in a dance hall and somebody is seen in the street or in a house with a knife and the police are called, then, without the certainty or the justified suspicion that it is Mr. A and not Mr. B, C, D, E or F, the police can search nobody. But under the amendment the police could search all the people in the dance hall if necessary in order to eradicate the knife from further use."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 25 January 1979, c.69.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Conservatives saw the power as extending well beyond the particular individual under suspicion. All the people present would be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) wishes to interrupt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot afford to refuse an invitation, Mr. Gourlay; I get so few. I merely wish to draw the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) to the activities of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) who is the representative of the Patronage Secretary on the Committee. He appears to be busily engaged in trying to persuade hon. Members on the Conservative Benches not to contribute to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) is quite entitled to engage in discussion with his colleagues. I think that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) should proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to proceed. I would have regarded that point as a point of disorder. Had I known that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) would make such a bogus point of order, I would never have given way. My instincts are always on the side of the Chair and of law and order. For a solicitor to make such an improper intervention is highly regrettable. However, I consider that the behaviour of the Whip was even more regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let me take another example—a gang of youths forming a mob."</p></blockquote>
There is no proof that the Solicitor-General was ever a youth—any more than that he has ever visited a dance hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mobbing and rioting, as the Lord Advocate will confirm, has become an enlarged feature of criminal activity in recent years. There are more
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
cases now than there used to be. If a policeman saw a mob of youths shouting 'Up the Yogi'—or whatever funny gang they belonged to—he would be entitled, seeing their mood"—</p></blockquote>
That must be a classic phrase for which we require definition; together with "certainty" and "suspicion", we now have "seeing their mood"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to search them and to ensure that none was carrying a weapon."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 25 January 1979, c.69.]</p></blockquote>
Whatever one may say about the language, it is clear that the argument for powers of search is an argument for the power to conduct a broad, random search.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis of the argument. Later, the Solicitor-General actually said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Surely the essential difference is that if the police know that somebody has a weapon but do not know who of several people it is, under clause 2"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the existing detention power—
	<br><blockquote><p>"they could not search any of them, but under this amendment they could search all of them."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 25 January, c.84.]</p></blockquote>
There, in five lines, is the clearest definition of the then Opposition's view of the police powers of search and what the Bill was designed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either the Government are sticking to the view that that is what the legislation was designed to do—in which case we must reject it—or the Minister is right when he says that they have dropped that view, in which case the Minister must tell us why they have dropped that view, because he also used the phrase in relation to numbers of people. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon. and learned Friend"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Solicitor-General for Scotland—
	<br><blockquote><p>"said that he wants the police, when they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that one person of an identifiable group is carrying a weapon but are unaware as to which person might be carrying a weapon, to have powers to search each of the individuals concerned."</p></blockquote>
In other words, he is going back on the quotation that I have just given. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That, I suggest, is a perfectly legitimate and desirable proposal. Most importantly, it is the one proposal necessary if we are to fill the gap in the existing law."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25 January 1979; c.107.]</p></blockquote>
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, a week ago, said "No, no, no. The clause doesn't mean any of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
nonsense that the Solicitor-General is saying. Ignore him. That was all rubbish. I am telling you what the clause is about. It is about something else. It is about the individual in which suspicion is crystallised." But a year ago the Minister himself was saying that was his view of what was demanded of the power to search. It was exactly in line with what a week ago he was saying was rubbish—he did not use that word, but he clearly meant it—and was backing up the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suspicious of certainty, as, in the words of the Solicitor-General, I am in relation to the clause, I repeat those words: the need for certainty in suspicion. Certainty in suspicion now rests with us, when we see the arguments that have been deduced from this, and yet the Minister tells us that it means something entirely different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we now have to look at the clause itself and see who is right. Clearly, the old argument for search goes, and we must say from this Committee—whatever happens to the clause—to the police posted in Scotland as of today at 12.30 p.m., that it does not mean what the Tory Party was telling them that it meant. It does not mean what the Solicitor-General was saying a year ago. It does not mean what the Under-Secretary in charge of law and order was saying a year ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Powers of search that have been argued for must be forgotten, whatever else it means. If the Minister is right, it does not mean that the arguments put forward this morning are right. They go, too, as do all the arguments based on the statistics, namely, that search will be able to winkle out the weapon and stop it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No argument now remains for the power of search as instigated by the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor); campaigned for by the 
	<i>Daily Express;</i> brought forward into a law and order ticket to win an election—promises made to the blue rinse set at Perth as a substitute for searching—all that must go, because it is no longer valid. We have rejected the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important, the police concerned may not apply the law in that way. The police themselves can now only search if the criteria that is in clause 2 exists, or if the criteria in the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 exists: they must have certainty in their suspicion, and it must be related to one individual. That is not my argument. That is the Minister's argument. That message must go out. Perhaps, in addition
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
to posters warning young people throughout Scotland that the powers of search are to be brought in, a few 16-inch posters should be put up in police stations. Those posters should say "You will be infringing the law if you stop and search a youngster in the street." That is what the police must be told. That is what the Minister's publicity campaign—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is making a most important point, but, in all fairness, the poster should add "Unless there is reasonable suspicion that he is committing an offence under the 1953 Act, centred on the individual that is being searched."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would accept that in 1-foot italics under the poster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the position that we have now reached. So with that I now say that if the Minister is asserting that there are no longer powers of search as we have known them, but something else, we have to ask "Is this clause then necessary?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause no longer means all those things, if the Minister has said that this is the one proposal necessary to fill the gap, and if he has now rejected that proposition, there is nothing left that is necessary to fill the gap. The clause then becomes unnecessary. Indeed, if the Minister is right, the clause itself would weaken the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1953 Act refers not to powers of search but to power of arrest. If the Minister is right, he is setting about unscrambling the powers of the Act rather than strengthening them. He will now understand why we remain suspicious of his assurance. This brings us to the clause itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that my hon. Friend said "All right, we will take your assurances at their face value. Indeed, from now on, we shall reiterate your assurances." If the clause is accepted, I shall certainly go up and down the length of Scotland saying that it does not mean what it says, and that the Minister says that it must not be applied in this way. I shall make it my business to say to chief constables "You had better warn your men. They may think that this is the power that they have been given, but they will be for the chopper if they use it." By Jove, the number of complaints against the police will boom if this is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before considering the basic argument
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
for rejecting the clause, I want to consider the clause itself. We tried a week ago to make good the Minister's words. He said that one must deal with a particular individual. "Well," we said, "in that case, let us spell it out. Let us include the word "particular".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 4(1), where it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any person is carrying an offensive weapon",</p></blockquote>
we propose that it should say "any one person". That will get rid of the uncertainty. In line 29, at the end, we proposed that the word "particular" should be added so that it reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The constable may search that particular person"</p></blockquote>
The introduction of the word "particular" would make good the Minister's points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then said "I think that the words are unnecessary. They are 
	<i>de trop,</i> redundant. Two words added to the clause would extend the clause to such an extent that we cannot keep an eye on it." There is a great deal of certainty in my suspicion of a Minister who rejects an amendment on the grounds that the words are unnecessary, rather than that the words alter the meaning of the clause. These two words tidied up and made good law of what the Minister claimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since he rejected that on the ground, first, that it was unnecessary to introduce more words, and yet these words clearly backed up what he was saying, then we are right to be suspicious of it, because it is not a good enough reason to give comfort to the lieges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those words were included my hon. Friend would perhaps have been able to support it. I confess that I would still have rejected it, but my hon. Friend said that he was tempted to accept it. The Minister did not accept it, on the grounds that the words were redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also he did not accept it, because, he said "Either they are redundant or they will unnecessarily restrict the operation of the clause." That is where we come now to the crude certainty of suspicion. It is crude because if he felt that the introduction of the word "particular" or the words "any one person" would restrict the clause, then the clause did not mean what he said, and it must be more extensive than the situation in which a suspicion is crystallising over a particular person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my logic is right, we are in a peculiar
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
triple situation in which the arguments for the powers of search have been rejected by the Government themselves and are no longer being brought in. Secondly, they bring in a clause which they say relates only to the situation where suspicion is based on a particular person. That consigned the whole Tory concept of crime to the dustbin, and the Minister allied himself to the Opposition libertarians. Then he said, "I shall not accept any words that make that good law, because it might unnecessarily restrict us."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, it is even more complicated and devious. Is he saying "I shall argue that we have rejected these concepts, but I shall find another means of bringing them in"? Or will there be yet another footnote to the posters that my hon. Friend wants in every police station about a police officer recording his suspicions and so forth, adding in brackets the words "but of course you can extend this from one person to a group if you like and if you can define the group."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we asked how big is a group that is like asking how long is a piece of string. The Minister said it would be extended to members of a group. When we asked whether that meant members of a group acting in concert he said it did not necessarily mean members of a group acting in concert. What he saw, of course, was the beginnings of a move towards random search. Therefore, while we will do him credit and honour and advocate that his words do not mean this, in the privacy of the Committee we remain with the suspicion that something else was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point of why we reject the clause. It is because we believe that even if we get through to policemen—constables, chief constables and others—the fact that the law does not mean what they thought it meant and they cannot apply it in this way, nevertheless there will be a tendency and a temptation to apply it in this way. We believe that it will lead to the harassment of young people without any compensatory balance in preventing crimes of violence. On the contrary, we believe that it will tend to lead to a breakdown of law and order and, therefore, to more crimes of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) talked about this matter of balance. We hail, by the way, the support of the Leader of the Scottish National Party who has on this occasion rejected the views of the chairman of the

Scottish National Party. I believe that both the right hon. Member and the hon. Gentleman the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser)—or it may have been the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram)—said that we have a balance. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] What is it they say? Northwards they are like an icicle in a Dutchman's beard, but these are southwards. There is a balance between the need to protect civil liberties and the need to protect those who may be subject to assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the power and authority of the State will be increased and not diminished by the Bill. We reject it for that reason. We believe it will not be effective but that it will lead to harassment which in turn will lead to a breakdown in police-community relations resulting in incidents which will become the subject of criminal prosecutions. We believe that the Government have misunderstood tha nature of the 1953 Act, that the matter was first brought forward as a piece of politicking, magnified into an article of faith for the annual conference of the Tory Party and has now been brought into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fear that this will lead not to a build-up of good police-community relations and the improvement of law and order but to the breakdown of law and order. I shudder to think of what will occur when a group of four or five innocent kids, one of whom carries a steel comb or a sharp biro pen, is stopped by a policeman who says "I want to begin a search" and the fourth member of the group says "My God, I have this steel comb in my pocket—I'm for the jump." Two things could happen. First, the youth might be found to be innocent. Secondly, he might pre-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I believe that the effect of such harassment will be bad in dance halls, community centres and in housing schemes. It is a backward step and the arguments for it have been exploded. I will leave the matter there until we hear the Minister's answers before I come back to deal with some of the statistical points that will be raised in a later stage of the discussion of the clause.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. May I seek your guidance, Mr. Gourlay, on the way in which the Government are handling the Bill, particularly if it is to be the practice that closures are to be moved, and accepted by the Chair?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always understood that on these important issues it was accepted House of Commons practice to have the fullest possible debate on clause stand part—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot challenge the ruling of the Chair, and that is what he is in essence doing. I am afraid that I cannot allow discussion on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I am far from challenging the ruling of the Chair. If I had been anxious to challenge the ruling of the Chair I should have persisted at a much earlier stage. But I am anxious to establish that when arrangements are made between Government and Opposition, they should be adhered to. The position is, as I understand it, that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) who are both anxious to make a contribution to the clause stand part debate on a very important subject, have been denied that right. This is not by the wishes of the Chair, because I believe, Mr. Gourlay, that you have been placed in the most invidious and embarrassing position of any Committee Chairman. But my two hon. Friends have been denied the right to make a contribution to the debate, as has the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) who is also anxious to contribute. All three hon. Members have been denied the right to do so by the Under-Secretary of State moving the closure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot allow a debate on the decision of accepting the motion, which is what is proceeding at the moment. Obviously when a closure motion is accepted there will always be hon. Gentlemen who are denied the opportunity of speaking. That sometimes arises from the length of time that other hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
Members take in Committee. There is no point in arguing because there is no point of order on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The other point that I was anxious to raise before you intervened on my point of order was the almost unheard of practice whereby a debate takes place and the Government do not even seek to answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Nothing irregular has happened in Committee this morning so there is no point of order to discuss. We now proceed to amendment No. 189.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I have some guidance Mr. Gourlay? An hon. Member will frequently say that an issue is to be discussed at great length, and one way of doing it is to put down a number of amendments. There is another situation in which hon. Members say that a matter is basically a matter of crucial principle, one that has occupied discussion in Scotland for a debate, and should be discussed at length, so they abstain from tabling a number of amendments in order that the principle can be thrashed out properly. In a similar situation on future clauses for discussion may I ask you to consider rejecting the Government's approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing happened today which would in any way alter the selection or otherwise of amendments. It is up to members of the Committee to table amendments if they wish and the Chair will deal with them in the usual way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Something has happened today which, rightly or wrongly—I have never argued with the Chairman's decision and I will not do so now—has meant that the closure has been moved and debate curtailed. The Opposition's one opportunity to debate the Bill has been in Committee. Scottish Television has given the Solicitor-General for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland and supporters of the Government.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is actually discussing whether or not the closure motion should have been accepted. I cannot allow discussion on that issue. Perhaps we can now debate clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. What happens now will dictate the Opposition's tactics for the remainder of the Bill. I must say to the Government through you, Mr. Gourlay, that we are not prepared to accept a gag being put upon us by a junior spokesman from any Department. If in important debates, a number of which are yet to come, the Government move the closure, I give notice that we will change our tactics and flood the Notice Paper with amendments to ensure that everything is debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, we withheld amendments on the clause because we wanted an extensive debate on clause stand part. That debate was not as prolonged as that which took place on the Labour Government's Bill and there is no reason, save that the Minister simply did not answer the debate because he wanted the clause to go through without debate, such was the Government's confidence in it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is again arguing the case for continuation of the debate which has been closed and decided on by the Committee. I now call the hon. Member who tabled amendment No. 189. Mr. Maxton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Unless this is a new point of order, I cannot accept it. I cannot allow discussion to continue irregularly, and that is what would happen unless the hon. Gentleman had a new point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a new point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Through these points of order, I am trying to tempt the Minister or the Whip to break their silence and tell us how they intend to handle the remainder of the Bill. That is important for the Opposition's tactics. We came to an arrangement with the Government, part of which was certainly not that the closure should be moved. I cannot understand why the Minister moved the closure. If I have now tempted the Minister to say how he intends to handle the rest of the Bill, we will be at least one stage further forward and the Opposition can consider how to approach the situation before meeting this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr Ewing) who speaks for the Opposition, should at least be aware that his colleague the Opposition Whip indicated to me and to my hon. Friend the Government Whip that they were anxious that the Committee should finish its proceedings at 7 o'clock. He was also anxious—I understand that he spoke for the Opposition—that we should rise at a similar hour on the further days that the Committee will have to consider the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that agreement was reached about when the Bill's Committee stage would be completed. While he and some of his hon. Friends have spoken at only reasonable length on important issues, we have spent the whole of the morning on a clause which we began considering before the Recess, and one of his hon. Friends spoke for 40 minutes on a single issue. He must accept that if the Committee is to complete its business in the time that has been agreed by both sides, it is necessary for these matters to be accelerated in the way suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I shall not become involved in what happened between my hon. Friend the Opposition Whip and the Government Whip. What concerns me is that the Minister has said that he is to be the judge of how long a debate should last.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the Chairman decides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is to decide what ration of work we are to complete before we rise at seven o'clock, nine o'clock or any other hour. That worries me, Mr. Gourlay. The Minister has confirmed my worst fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to become involved at this stage in what went on between the two hon. Members concerned. However, the Minister has confirmed my worst fears. The Minister is now to be the judge of whether he should move the closure. Whether it is accepted is, of course, entirely in your hands, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always obeyed the Chair's rulings. I am not arguing with you, Mr. Gourlay, but I am worried that the Minister has set himself up as the judge of how long a debate should continue before he proposes to you that it should be closured. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
not acceptable to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not concerned with what is acceptable to the Opposition—or to the Government. It is always a Minister's prerogative to decide when he wishes to move the closure. However, it is for the Chair to decide whether to accept. That is what happened this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I ask for guidance on what happens when hon. Members have made it clear that they have refrained from tabling amendments in order to allow for a lengthy clause stand part discussion. Clearly the Chair is not concerned with that. The Government, however, understood what we were doing, and it is they, therefore, who must be faulted. I must express my surprise that you accepted the motion, Mr. Gourlay. I am not criticising, but I was surprised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, The Minister appears to base his argument partly on the fact that one of the Opposition speeches took 40 minutes. It could be said that it was just as well that I took 40 minutes. Otherwise we should not have discussed clause stand part at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again, the hon. Gentleman is discussing what happened before the closure motion. That is not in order. The other aspects of the hon. Gentleman's points of order, concerning amendments and so on, are entirely for members of the Committee to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Will you help me on a small matter? The Under-Secretary has referred to when we might or might not finish tonight. I am not clear about Committee procedure on such matters when we start at 4.30 p.m. I have not been involved in such sittings before. There have been suggestions that a finishing date for the Committee has been established. I would have thought that that date was agreed upon on the assumption that we would be sitting well into the night on many occasions. If we do not I cannot see how we could possibly get through all the business.
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
Is it a matter for the Government to decide when we stop tonight, or is it up to the Chairman? How can we ensure that we have adequate time to consider matters tonight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Standing Orders of the House provide that when a Committee meets at 4.30 p.m. the sitting is open-ended. It is for the Committee to decide when to terminate the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Does that mean that either side of the Committee can move the closure? If I were to decide at 12 o'clock that I had had enough, that we had discussed enough and that it was time to consider the next point, would it be permissible for me, as a Back Bencher, so to move, or is that a Government prerogative?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be most useful to know whether one of us, or the Government alone, could move the adjournment. It would establish a democratic harmony. The hon. Members for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) could then have their say on the Committee for once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under Standing Orders it is open to any member of the Committee to move the adjournment. It is for the Chair to decide whether to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a final point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Would any such motion to adjourn or to extend the proceedings be a debatable motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it would be a debatable motion. We now come to amendment No. 189.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
