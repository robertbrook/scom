	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 101, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>431 B. Where any apportionment of profits, income, gains, assets or liabilities is required to be made under any provision of this Chapter, and such apportionment is to be made in relation to any class of linked business written by a company, the Treasury may by order provide that such provision should also be applied (with such amendments as may be regarded as necessary) where any similar apportionment falls to be made in relation to any other class of linked business written by that company.'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment to a series of insurance provisions constitutes the culmination of a process that began with the Finance Bill in 1987 and an undertaking made by the then Chief Secretary to reveiw the basis of the taxation of insurance. At the time, a process was set in train, the intention of which was to take a general look at the tax arrangements for life assurance which had developed piecemeal over a long period. In due course, that review was introduced and the Finance Bill of 1989 contained the first tranche of its recommendations. The measures that we shall discuss this afternoon were announced in December of last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our attitude to the review was marked by our anxiety to ensure that the British insurance industry is competitive, especially as we approach 1992 and the implications that that will have for the economy and for the insurance industry in particular. Given the implementation of EEC directives on freedom of services, we are anxious that the competitive position of the insurance industry is not undermined by the Government's proposals. We want to maintain a fair balance of interests between ordinary taxpayers and policy holders and to ensure that an undue burden does not fall on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, the tax burden on the insurance industry had increased faster than its rate of growth. That is not out of line with the experience of other savings institutions. After measuring the Government's performance in introducing the proposals against that criterion, we welcome them as a basis for the future taxation of the industry, but we have several specific concerns about schedule 4. We seek certain assurances from the Government that the worries of the industry will be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
Amendment No. 134 reflects our anxiety that, despite the length of the schedule, it often extends only to specific classes of business. We compare that with new section 432A(2). Some life offices feel that it will not be easy to allocate income, gains or expenses to other categories - mainly general annuity business or permanent health business. The amendment would rectify that by giving the Treasury power to make rules, if necessary, covering such allocations along the lines of those in the schedule. The amendment is relatively modest and its acceptance should not present any difficulties to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, the Government tabled amendments Nos. 126 and 127 and it will therefore be unnecessary for us to press amendment No. 131, but we seek assurances on amendment No. 134 and we expect the Government to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 133—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is slightly awkward, because amendment No. 133 has been grouped separately. The Committee may wish to discuss that amendment with amendment No. 134. I would be tolerant of that wish if it was echoed by the Government Front Bench, otherwise the selection must stand as printed. If both Front Benches wish it, I am happy to amend the selection list, but amendment No. 133 would have to be moved formally later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the hon. Gentleman may refer to amendment No. 133, which can be moved formally later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. Cormack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 covers a matter that has been raised by the insurance industry and which is so technical and complex that one sometimes feels like Alice in Wonderland because of the mind boggling capacity of these provisions. The amendment would remove too wide a category. The importance of paragraph 8 of the schedule is that it provides that whenever an asset is held in one of four ring-fenced categories or in a residual category and is moved to another category, tax is paid as though it had been sold and re-acquired. That is covered by new section 440(1). Secondly, whenever an asset is transferred within an insurance group, it cannot be transferred on a tax free basis. That is covered by new section 440(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new section 440(1) is to overcome potential abuse. However, when a transfer is made within an insurance group and it is in the same category, there does not seem to be the need for a provision as wide as that contained in the Bill. That is why we tabled the amendment. Likewise, if the transfer is made to a parent company, the total assets of which remain unchanged, in each category, it would not seem to be necessary to cast the net as wide as it is. Conservative Members glance up in recognition at the transparently obvious nature of that point. New section 440(3) is wider than it needs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
to be to mirror new section 440(1). Amendment No. 133 seeks to rectify that. Those are two modest matters to which we hope the Minister will readily respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Opposition's constructive approach to the legislation and congratulate them on penetrating the Byzantine complexities of life assurance taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) is right to state that amendment No. 131 seeks to achieve the same as Government amendments Nos. 126 and 127. I welcome the fact that he will not press that amendment to a Division, because the Government amendments seek to achieve the same as the Opposition's amendment in a technically more effective way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 134. This year the Government decided not to opt for a wide-ranging change to the treatment of all general annuity business, whether linked or not. Such a comprehensive change, if made would, in all likelihood, overtake any separate provision of the sort now in question for linked general annuity business. In the event, we decided that other insurance measures must take priority this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always possible greatly to refine taxation. Nothing gives greater scope for continual refinement than life assurance taxation. We believed that a wide-ranging reform of general annuity business should not be a priority this year. If it were in future, the proposed changes in this amendment would be unnecessary. Amendment No. 134 does not achieve technically everything that the Opposition want. Some 15 or 20 amendments scattered over the life assurance clauses and schedule would be necessary to do that. Such extra complications cannot be justified on purely theoretical arguments of neatness and symmetry, appealing though those qualities may be. The Committee would wish to be persuaded that the Bill is deficient in a material way in its application to a significant volume of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have discussed the issues with the industry and recognise that some wish to see change in this sphere, the industry has provided no evidence that it would benefit materially from the extra-complex amendment that would be required to achieve the objectives of amendment No. 134.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar picture emerges from amendment No. 133. I think that the industry understands and accepts that the deemed disposals and re-acquisitions imposed by the Bill are a necessary consequence of the improved apportionment machinery imposed by the Bill. I acknowledge the beginnings of a theoretical case for both the exceptions envisaged by the amendment. The question is whether they are sufficiently important to merit the complex changes that would be needed to tackle and implement them in a watertight way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The much more complex legislation that would be needed is not really desirable. No doubt further
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
provision could be added to deal with this, and tie up other loose ends at the same time, but I am not sure whether the industry would regard a thorough job of work on this topic as preferable to the Bill as it stands. I am clear that it would mean very much more complex legislation than at present to deal with an issue whose practical importance is so far obscure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the points in the amendment are ones that the Committee might wish to deal with, given the luxury of unlimited time and space. As things are, a strong practical case for action has not been made by the industry or by the Committee today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point, but if the Inland Revenue and the Minister recognise that the argument put forward by the industry and the Opposition has merit, it ill-behoves the Minister to say that it is all too complicated and that we have not enough time to implement it. The argument has merit and the industry believes that it is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Diane Abbott 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yeah!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that a distinguished member of the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service contributes a "Yeah" to my humble efforts. I am sure that that carries us forward and that, having heard her "Yeah", the Minister will succumb to my hon. Friend's blandishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the industry to be on a proper footing so that it can operate effectively and competitively. Why is the Minister so unforthcoming and unhelpful? We hear what he says and are not convinced. However, we shall not press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 103, line 22, leave out from "means" to end of line 26 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>
"(a) where all of the liabilities of the long term business are linked liabilities, the part of that reserve which bears to the whole the same proportion as the amount of the liabilities of the category of business in question bears to the whole amount of the liabilities of the long term business,</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>(c) in any other case, the part of that reserve which bears to the whole the same proportion as the amount of the with-profits liabilities of the category of business in question bears to the whole amount of the with-profits liabilities of the long term business;</p></blockquote>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
and Government amendment No. 127 to schedule 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have introduced rules for apportioning investment return between the different types of business treated separately for tax purposes. Where it is not possible to make a more direct attribution of income and gains, an apportionment is to be made by reference to liabilities weighted to take into account the investment reserve—the excess of assets over liabilities. That reflects the fact that those excess assets generally support with-profits business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the legislation as drafted is incomplete because it fails to cater for the case in which there is an excess of assets over liabilities—an investment reserve—but no, or very little, with-profits business. The amendments deal with that problem by introducing revised apportionment rules in these cases. If there is nothing but linked liabilities, the investment reserve will simply be apportioned by reference to those liabilities. Otherwise, it will be apportioned by reference to non-linked liabilities if there is no, or very little, with-profits business, or by reference to the existing provision if there is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of that in schedule 4 is to remove an obscurity in the Bill as drafted. In schedule 5, it makes a more substantial change by allocating more income and gains to overseas from a business where the Bill as published would allocate less than is commercially realistic. That achieves what the Opposition seek and I hope that it will have the support of the whole Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are glad that our tabling amendment No. 131 prompted such a response from the Government. We accept that the principle underlying our amendment has been fully met by amendments Nos. 126 and 127.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>CAS = CS, and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) in any other case,'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment introduces a small benefit for mutual offices. It provides for unallocated surplus to be ignored in their case when it is necessary to compute trading profits on the special basis provided for in the new section 432E. This reflects the fact that all surplus of a mutual is for the benefit of the policy holders even if it is not immediately allocated to them in the form of bonus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under existing law it is not generally possible for an insurance company to transfer its life and other long-term insurance business to a friendly society. Since the publication of the Finance Bill, we have learnt that the Department of Trade and Industry has concluded that United Kingdom legislation should facilitate such transfers in order to comply with the EC life insurance directives. As a consequence, the DTI is in the process of making regulations under the European Communities Act 1972 which will extend the existing provisions in the Insurance Companies Act 1982 about transfers of business between insurance companies. The fact that that is being done has already been reported in the press. There is no reason in principle not to extend the same tax treatment to such transfers as to other broadly similar transfers involving insurance companies and friendly societies, and that is what these amendments do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have introduced rules for apportioning investment return between the different types of business treated separately for tax purposes. Income and gains from assets tied to a particular category of business will, where possible, be allocated to that business. The new rules already make provision for deemed disposals for capital gains tax purposes if assets are moved from one category of business to another. This ensures that the right amount of investment return is taxed if we are concerned with basic life assurance business, or is exempt from tax if the assets in question are linked to non-taxable pension business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments apply the same principle to tax investment income from securities within the accrued income scheme. That was introduced by the Finance Act 1985. It charges the transferor where rights to accrued interest are passed to the transferee, and relieves the transferor when rights to income yet to accrue are retained by him. The transferee is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
relieved, or charged accordingly. In effect, it removes the scope for internal bond washing that would otherwise arise if securities pregnant with income were transferred to a tax-exempt category of business. I believe, therefore, that the amendment will have the support of the Opposition, as it effectively prevents a form of tax avoidance which nobody would seek to encourage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one matter we feel it necessary to raise on clause stand part. It relates to the wide power given to the Treasury under schedule 4 in relation to the proposed new section 431A of the Taxes Act 1988. That power is worrying, as it is one of many that the legislation gives to the Treasury. The Institute of Directors has noted that the Treasury would be empowered to amend the whole of the life assurance taxation regime where such alteration is considered expedient as a result of the exercise of any power under the Insurance Companies Act 1982. That at least limits to some extent the Treasury's power to amend the regulations, because, under schedule 5, the proposed new schedule 19AA states that the Treasury
	<br><blockquote><p>"may … amend any of the following provisions of this Schedule."</p></blockquote>
One understands why Ministers would want to claw greater and greater powers unto themselves and their officials, but when they do so they must expect to be asked to give their reasons. The industry would expect—and we demand—some assurance that any such amendment would not be retrospective. It must also be promulgated well in advance to allow time for some debate of the issues involved. Such a debate must be held if the industry and other interested parties are to give the considered responses that so far have characterised the development of insurance taxation and its associated rules and regulations since the initial review was announced in 1987. The Minister has shown a willingness to facilitate debate and the making of representations. That freedom has been put to good effect by the industry since the Treasury first indicated that these changes were to be introduced. What we want is an assurance that this wide power will not be used retrospectively and that, where it is used, plenty of time will be allowed for debate and representation. Such an assurance, given the width and extent of the power, is eminently reasonable, and we look forward to the Minister giving it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) for drawing attention to this use of secondary legislation. I, too, think that one should be sparing in the use of such secondary legislation, but in this case the law is so complex and the industry so dynamic that there must be the possibility of change. It therefore seems sensible to include this power in the Bill. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that any secondary legislation would require a negative resolution of the House. That would give Parliament the chance to scrutinise changes to the regulations. Consequently, it is highly unlikely that Parliament would permit—or that the Government would seek to make—any retrospective changes by this means. I hope that that assurance will set the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This schedule tackles overseas life business and a new regime, along the lines suggested by the Treasury in December, for the conduct of such business. Paragraph 1 stops the expenses of overseas life business being deducted in the I minus E computation. Paragraph 2 is consequential to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 repeals former section 441 which stopped the I and the E of an overseas life fund from being taken into the I minus E computation and provides that the profits of a fund are to be calculated as if the overseas business was a separate trade, and then taxed as I. That is a result of the new subsection 441(2). We are concerned that while new subsection 441(8) provides that gains on the sale of the assets of the overseas fund are not to be taxable, there is no specific provision to complete the circle by stating that the income from the assets of overseas funds are no longer to be taxed directly as I, although that is implicit in new subsection 441(2) and new schedule 19AA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary confirm that the income from the assets of the overseas funds cannot also be taxed directly as I under Cases IV or V and that the Inland Revenue will not have the choice of taxing the I instead of the Case VI profit? The industry will be anxious to have that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsections 441(4) and 441(7) show how the trading profit of the fund is to be calculated. New subsection 441A allows dividends from United Kingdom companies which are normally not taxable when received by a United Kingdom company to be included in the calculation of the trading profit, subject to a partial tax credit in some circumstances. There is nothing controversial or difficult about that. However, we are mystified about paragraph 4 which appears to have been drafted wrongly the first time around. There has been a resulting hiatus in the explanatory notes on clauses, as one paragraph appears to have been deleted between the date that the notes were originally written and the date that the Bill was published. Perhaps the Minister can cast some light on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 deals with how relief for overseas tax paid on the overseas business is to be calculated. All these provisions need rules to identify which assets are those of the overseas life fund. Paragraph 6 of new schedule 19AA provides them. We want an explanation from the Minister on the issue, to which amendments Nos. 132, 128 and 129 refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New schedule 19AA provides that assets within the long-term fund must be designated as overseas life fund assets. After designation they stay as assets of the fund until they leave the long-term fund through sale or other means. If, at the end of a given period, the existing overseas fund assets are less than the liabilities of the fund, extra assets must be designated to make up the difference. That is fine in principle. The problem is with the order of designation laid down by paragraph 5(5). The order of designation is determined by order of preference.
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
If one is in the first category, one gets preference over the second and third categories. That order is illogical. It is right that the first tranche of assets, those contractually linked to overseas business, should be in the position that they are. Paragraph 5(5)(a) is okay. It is not logically justifiable for paragraph 5(5)(b), which deals with assets denominated in an overseas currency, to be given preference to paragraph 5(5)(c) which deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"assets the management of which is under the control of a person whose normal place of work is at a branch or agency at or through which the company carries on overseas life assurance business".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5(5)(c) is obviously geographically linked to overseas life business while paragraph 5(5)(c) is solely concerned with the particular currency in which the business happens to be contracted. The second tranche should be assets that are de facto managed by the officers of the overseas business as overseas assets. They are currently relegated to the third tranche, ranking after assets that are fortuitously denominated in the currency of the territory in which the overseas business is carried on, despite having no connection with the overseas branch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that that logic has not escaped the Revenue and that it supports switching the paragraphs. However, it is worried that that would let United Kingdom equities leap over foreign equities. We understand that concern and have tried to deal with it in amendments Nos. 132, 128 and 129. Two of the amendments reverse the order of the two paragraphs while the other deals with the problem of the mix of United Kingdom and foreign equities. The Minister should remove the illogicality by accepting one of the two clusters of amendments, which would successfully deal with an obvious and incongruous problem in the Bill of putting before assets which are clearly linked to overseas offices and life work those assets which happen to be in the denomination of a foreign currency. We hope that the Minister will make a concession on that point, given the obvious logic that underlies it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of the case for the Opposition's amendments is the claim that the order of priority for assigning assets proposed in them will give a result that is closer to commercial reality than the order in the Bill. That is a fair summary of the case made by the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). In most cases, however, life offices will, as a matter of commercial prudence, want to match liabilities with assets in the same currency, and for many offices the proposed change would make little
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
or no practical difference. It would, on the other hand, leave these provisions open to abuse. The life offices would be tempted to hold their United Kingdom assets at their foreign branches, and their foreign assets in the United Kingdom. This would lead to excessive tax relief. The income from the United Kingdom assets held overseas would effectively be exempt from United Kingdom tax, while the income from the foreign assets held in the United Kingdom would qualify for credit relief for overseas tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point is recognised in amendment No. 132 which excludes shares in United Kingdom companies from the higher order of priority. This, however, is not sufficient to prevent abuse since there are many assets other than the equity shares in United Kingdom companies that could be held at the overseas branches by those wanting to use these provisions for tax avoidance. The most obvious example would be loan stock in United Kingdom companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also advised that the amendments are technically deficient. I am not persuaded that the order of selecting assets set out in the Bill will cause substantial difficulty for the life offices. The dangers inherent in changing the order in the way proposed in the amendments must outweigh the marginal benefits that would flow to a small number of life assurance companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brent, South raised a number of points and I first apologise to him, the Committee and you, Mr. Cormack, for an error in the notes on clauses in relation to clause 34. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his assiduity in pursuing the matter and I am sorry that his task was made more difficult. Paragraph 14 of the notes should be omitted and in paragraphs 15 to 25 all references to paragraph numbers in schedule 5 should be reduced by one, so that paragraph 15 of the notes refers to paragraph 4 of schedule 5 and so on. I regret the error but it does not reflect any change in the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about income from assets and overseas funds. No provision is needed to secure the change that he sought and I confirm that the income cannot be taxed twice. I hope that sets his mind at rest on the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 31, line 9, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"or where the Treasury by order appoint a later day, in relation to accounting periods beginning on or after that day (and not in relation to any earlier accounting period, even if the order is made after 1st January 1991 and the period has ended before it is made).".</p></blockquote>
The legislation gives life offices an opportunity to replace their holdings in authorised unit trusts and similar offshore funds with assets that are not subject to a charge under clause 38. Unfortunately, by taking advantage of the replacement relief provisions prior to clause 38 coming into operation, companies would incur additional charges in the form of stamp duty if stamp duty on securities has not been abolished at the time the replacement occurs. While the date for the abolition of stamp duty has not been fixed, it is possible that it will be close to 31 December 1991, which is the date of the first occasion of charge under clause 38 for most companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a clash of timing were to occur, the proposed amendment would enable the start date of clause 38 to be deferred to give companies sufficient time after the abolition of stamp duty to replace their holdings in unit trusts and so on and thus avoid a charge under clause 38.

	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

	<p>Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think it right to draw attention to the fact that this is the first introduction into United Kingdom taxation law of the radical idea that in some cases it is right to charge tax on unrealised capital gains. It is accepted in the industry that that was almost inevitable, given recent developments in the insurance industry, and that there is considerable justification for the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Standard Life Assurance Co., for example, had already built up its unit trust holdings and its main life fund to £2.4 billion out of £13.4 billion by the end of 1988. Every other insurance company is almost bound to follow its example, and the Inland Revenue had no alternative to announcing the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister prepared to assure the Committee that the Inland Revenue will not seek to tax unrealised capital gains of other types? The precedent is creating widespread alarm in some quarters, and it is feared that the Government may acquire a taste for such measures. [Hon Members: "Never."] I hear voices suggesting, uncharitably, that a Labour Government might do so. That is not fair, bearing in mind our mood this afternoon, and it brings an unwelcome edge of party politics into our proceedings. You will be glad to hear, Mr. Cormack, that I do not intend to rise to the bait, but I should like to have from the Financial Secretary an assurance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
that the Government do not intend to tax unrealised capital gains in any other circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I do not stray out of order—there is a link between clauses 38 and 39. Both clauses introduce a new charge from 1 January 1991 subject to transitional reliefs contained in schedule 6. Transitional relief is of two sorts. First, there is broad standstill relief for pre-1990 policies as provided in paragraph 2, whereby units held to back pre-1990 linked policies still held at the end of a later year are not to be subject to clause 38. A limit is set to that in paragraph 2(3) of schedule 6. Secondly, where units are sold and proceeds used to purchase chargeable assets, a new roll-over relief, which did not exist for similar sales prior to clause 38, is to be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of such transitional relief is obvious, as it is designed to minimise the hardship that would otherwise be caused to policy holders and shareholders by the implementation of clause 38. The clause ceases to apply because the units were sold and the exchange gives rise to no immediate chargeable gain. That is dealt with by paragraphs 4 and 5 of schedule 6. Instead, chargeable gains will arise in the usual way when the replacement assets are sold, and the roll-over relief applies only to units linked to pre-1990 policies. That is contained in paragraph 3(2) of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will bear with me, Mr. Cormack, but clause 39 goes on broadly to say that any charges arising under clause 38 are not to be taxed immediately, but spread over seven years. At first sight, that appears to be illogical because a direct sale of the underlying assets would have been taxed immediately if the business were not unit-linked, but it is clearly designed to mirror the 1989 seven-year spreading of acquisition expenses. In effect, it is another sort of transitional relief between 1991 and 1997, while clause 38 builds up to making its full effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want an assurance from the Minister. The original proposals made by the Treasury in this area have been watered down by the transitional relief, and the industry has come to accept it. Bearing in mind the criteria that were laid down at the outset of this afternoon's debate, we are worried because the transitional relief might prove to be less prolonged than was first thought to be the case. I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many life offices are worried that the interaction of capital gains tax part disposal rules and schedule 6 may lead to a loss of standstill relief to units backing pre-1990 policies, yet that was not the intention of those who introduced the legislation, as is clear from the 20 December 1989 press release, which foreshadowed that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting changes to schedule 6 were needed to ensure that transitional relief had its full, intended and announced effect. It is complex, but that brings us back to the difficulty outlined by the Minister when we debated earlier amendments. He recognised that difficulties existed, but said that it would be too difficult to overcome them. We are dealing with transitional relief and the Opposition cannot accept that it is inappropriate to introduce an amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
to deal with our concern. We know that the Inland Revenue has accepted the point in principle, and we seek a statement from the Minister that the relief will be applied in practice in a way that will not undermine schedule 6 and the impact of clause 38 as a way of spreading transitional relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister gives no assurance, the consequences for policyholders will be real, not academic. In a debate on the insurance industry one should always have it in mind that there is a tendency for provisions to impact more adversely on the policyholder than on the shareholder. Shareholders have an expectation of what is a reasonable return. When money has to be found, it tends to be found from the little person who has the policy and who relies on it for his pension or endowment policy. That little person is all too often ill-equipped to bear even relatively small losses that occur as a result of changes. The Minister should give reassurances about the impact of transitional relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brent, South suggested that the appearance in United Kingdom tax law of taxation on realised gains was unprecedented, but there is a precedent in unit trusts. Unit trust offices may hold their units unsold for many years but it is not true that no gains will have been realised. Portfolio investments of unit trusts will be managed and will generally be turned over at least as actively as the life company's own direct portfolio would be. The charge that we are introducing aims, in a rough and ready way, to mirror the turnover of assets and to spread the charge over seven years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest by telling him that this is not the thin end of the wedge. There is no need for other companies whose circumstances are different from those of life assurance companies to see this measure as advance notice that they may be charged on unrealised gains. We have no such plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brent, South made a point that referred as much to clause 39 as to clause 38. Considerable consultation took place with the industry about this provision. From the outset, there was all-round agreement that relief should be kept as simple as possible, so the relief uses the ordinary capital gains rules. That reduces the compliance and administration costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ordinary capital gains rules operate in a way that means gains are brought into charge more quickly than the contract liabilities run-off. That effect is considerably mitigated by the fact that the resultant gains are spread forward and charged to tax over seven years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions took place between Revenue officials and the industry's representatives to consider a method of calculation that brought gains into charge at a rate that was in line with the run-off of liabilities. The legislation required to deal with this calculation in detail would be very complex and lengthy and would be a departure from the normal capital gains rules. Given the fact that the gains resulting from clause 38 are in any event spread over seven years, I am not persuaded that the introduction of such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 122, line 31, leave out from "transferee" to end of line 34 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and (c) no sale or transfer of assets which is made to the transferee by the transferor shall be treated as giving rise to any allowance or charge to or on the transferor.".</p></blockquote>
This area is beset by anomalies. The Revenue had to make concessions when one life company was rescued by another or when a group, quite innocently, restructured. Schedule 7 gives those concessions statutory force and is in no way contentious—which is why we hope that the Minister will see the virtues of our amendment, which concerns a technical weakness in the matter of capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 aims to give the company that takes over a life fund the same capital allowances that the old owner would have received. However, it seems not to ensure that there would be no balancing allowances or charges on the old owner when the transfer took place. The use of the word "such" in lines 29 and 34 seems to restrict the effect of paragraph 5 to ongoing annual capital allowances and not to allow it to extend to capital allowances given or charged on the transfer of assets. The point is therefore not wholly clear, and the amendment would ensure that paragraph 5 operated as it was intended to do. An assurance by the Minister that paragraph 5 will be operated in that way and that the use of the word "such" will not be an impediment to its so doing would enable us to withdraw the amendment, which is a purely technical one to ensure that the paragraph has the full effect intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a well intentioned amendment and is designed to clarify the position of the transferor company in relation to capital allowances when long-term insurance business is transferred from one company to another. It is not, however, necessary for this purpose, which is why it does not have Government backing. Subsection (2)(a) of the new section 152A already ensures that no allowances or charges will be made to or on the transferor company as a result of the transfer. Furthermore, the amendment removes from the new section any specific reference to the position of the transferee in relation to any allowances or charges which might conceivably arise as a result of the transfer. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
therefore leaves the position of the transferee company uncertain.

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a matter with the Minister to which I hope that he will respond positively. We want to remove the longstanding anomaly and unfairness between the treatment under the current arrangements of self-administered schemes and life company schemes, and of different companies. The anomaly relates to pension fund tax repayments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pension fund investment income is, quite properly, exempt from tax whether the fund is separate and self-administered with its own trustees, or part of a life company's overall fund. Where tax is deducted from investment income during the year, that tax is repayable to the trustees of a life company. That is all well and good and what one would expect. The problem arises in relation to the arrangements for making these repayments, as they differ considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-administered pension schemes normally obtain repayments monthly during the year. Some life companies can obtain repayments either monthly or quarterly for both their pension and life business. Life companies set up after 1973 are in the odd, anomalous position of being unable to obtain repayments until they have prepared tax computations and sent them to the Revenue after the end of the year. Our view, which is shared by the Association of British Insurers, is that the arrangements between self-administered schemes and life company schemes and between different companies are unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue accepts that the current arrangements are indefensible, but despite assurances during the discussions of the 1989 and 1990 changes that something would be done, nothing in the Bill remedies the situation. We have again heard the cry that it would be too complex and difficult. That view is not shared by the industry, which has made proposals about how a remedy might be achieved.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
The Treasury then said that it would cost too much. That is an understandable concern which the industry must meet if the public interest is to be protected and the balance between the interests of the ordinary taxpayer and those of the policy holder is to be maintained, as we are anxious that it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the changes could be phased in in ways that would minimise the cost and remove a longstanding anomaly and source of unfairness between different sides of the same coin. It is accepted that the investment income of all of them should be exempt from tax; it is a question of how the repayments should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity of the schedule stand part debate to tell us that the matter will be dealt with later, perhaps by bringing forward a new clause. If that cannot be done under this Bill, perhaps something can be done in next year's Finance Bill so that at long last the anomaly can be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dismiss this proposal for reasons of complexity. As the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) recognised, the industry wants this change because of the arguments that it puts forward and, above all, because a large sum is involved. It would diminish the Government's cash flow and enhance that of the industry by the same degree. We could not envisage a change involving a lot of money this year. A phasing-in scheme at an acceptable cost to the Exchequer has yet to be proposed. In any case, we could not easily envisage making such a change this year, although we expect confidently that the issue will be raised in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What could be more reputable, or more deserving of our attention? We have an opportunity to get back on their feet those important, if relatively small, institutions so that they may encourage the savings habit—Conservative Members are perking up at the mention of encouraging the savings habit—and provide tax relief for their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Friendly societies experienced their heyday in 19th century Victorian England. Their expansion was
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
prompted by the virtues of thrift and independence— the ears of Conservative Members are pricking up at those two words—overlaid by a fear of the workhouse. That prompted the great burgeoning of interest in and support for friendly societies in the 19th century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that in addition to the virtue of thrift, the friendly societies were based also on the notion of the utility of collective and community-based action? That is in complete contrast to the Conservative party, whose leader says that there is no such thing as community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) brings us straight to the point. The friendly societies' aspect of collective action and mutual self-help caused them to fall out of favour with the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson). He was not anxious about thrift, although he was certainly concerned about independence and the need to have the spectre of the workhouse in the background to discipline the working classes. Independence and the workhouse should have appealed to the right hon. Gentleman, but when he dug a little deeper and found that the virtues of mutual self help and collective action were also involved, he went off the idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was how friendly societies were treated during the right hon. Gentleman's Chancellorship. When the Treasury was in the maw of the right hon. Gentleman, friendly societies would knock at its door with their entreaties for some consideration to be shown for their plight as they became less competitive in terms of attracting savings and new deposits, but answer came there none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must give credit where credit is due. When the Treasury was released from the maw of the right hon. Member for Blaby, its response to the legitimate worries of friendly societies changed slightly. We saw the welcome publication of the important document entitled "Friendly Societies: A New Framework". That valuable consultative document was long overdue. No one did more on the Opposition Benches than my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) to prompt its publication. When raising the issue of friendly societies, his was often a lone voice crying in the wilderness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the analogy of John the Baptist, considering his unfortunate end at the hands of just such a person as my hon. Friend. However, undoubtedly John the Baptist was at times a lone voice crying in the wilderness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By referring to friendly societies this afternoon, we hope to obtain clarification from the Government of when they intend to bring into effect the proposals in the document. The proposals were widely welcomed not only by the industry, but by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
financial press, potential customers and those who would benefit from such legislation. After all, the people who would benefit would be those who have a little money to put aside. They have had a longstanding relationship within their communities with friendly societies. When we consider the societies' links with the guilds, we find that such a relationship goes back to the 19th century and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eminently sensible proposals that friendly societies should be allowed to manage unit trusts and personal equity plans, to offer long-term insurance and to arrange loans and mortgages were widely welcomed. They should be implemented at the earliest possible date which, in reality, is next year. The Financial Secretary or the Economic Secretary, depending on who is feeling the most generous, now has the opportunity to say that, in 1991, the public and the industry will be able to take advantage of the proposals in the document. Such assurances will be dust in the mouths of industry and investors unless we tackle in the Bill the capacity of friendly societies to attract new deposits now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at what has happened to friendly societies since the war, we see an unhappy picture. In 1945 they had 8.7 million members, but today they have only 3 million members. The number of societies has fallen from 2,740 in 1945 to 467 in 1988. There has been a sharp drop in the number of policies taken out as a result of the reduction in 1984 of the maximum tax exempt monthly investment from £20 to £9. Because of those blows to the industry, it will not be in shape to take advantage of the proposals in the Green Paper unless we consider the matters that the amendments would rectify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One proposal is more generous than the other. One would increase the amount capable of attracting tax relief from £100 to £250 a year and the other would raise it to £900 a year. That would ensure that friendly societies could compete effectively with PEPs, TESSAs and business expansion schemes. Such an increase is required if friendly societies are to compete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall the report on friendly societies that recommended an increase of some £15,000 in the total sum that could enjoy tax benefits. Our request is relatively modest, but necessary if friendly societies are to be able to compete. An increase to £900 a year would, with the 10-year life of a normal friendly society deposit and 5-year retention period for a TESSA, be appropriate to ensure competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is considered to be too high, amendment No. 81 proposes a more modest increase from £100 to £250, which amounts to £5 a week or £22 a month. That is not unreasonable if the intention is to confine the benefit to the less well off. It represents the cost of less than 10 cigarettes a day, but would provide an eventual benefit of more than £2,500 after 10 years and the additional advantage of life cover. That is not to be sneezed at by families on low incomes who would not normally consider taking out a life policy, but who would have the added advantage of some life cover for ever increasing funeral and
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
testamentary expenses. That is an important consideration when one thinks of the areas of the community in which friendly societies have traditionally found their strongest support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are friendly and modest, and are designed to give friendly and modest societies the lift that they need. The principles that underpin those societies—friendly help and companionship in adversity—remain valuable and important. Over the next 18 months some Conservative Members will need some of that friendly help, as they will also need companionship in adversity. They need that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the more agreeable features of Finance Bill debates over the years has been the discussions that we have had on friendly societies. The one exception was perhaps in 1984, when we had to listen to hour after hour of speeches, late at night and early in the morning, about friendly societies. However, the debates have generally been good-natured and constructive. The contribution from the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) was typical of that, and I have certainly gained insights into the dance of Salome that I would not have gained, had I not listened to the hon. Gentleman's speech this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation that is promised on friendly societies will be welcomed as much among Conservative as Opposition Members. I think that the hon. Member for Brent, South was a little unfair in some of his early remarks. I wish to pay tribute to the tremendous work of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Mr. Lilley), the Financial Secretary, in the preparation of the Green Paper and the legislation that is to follow. It is quite wrong to say that nothing was done for friendly societies when my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Far from it: good foundations for the future were laid, and they have met with strong and widespread support. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will seek to build on those foundations in his remarks this evening and in future. Last year, I said that I hoped that the Government would try to be sympathetic towards friendly societies. They have shown their good faith in that regard, and I look forward to constructive discussions about the societies' future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret the number of small misconceptions from which the hon. Member for Brent, South seemed to suffer when he deliberately introduced a partisan note into his remarks at the start of this debate. It is unfortunate that such a subject should have been introduced in a manner that, although agreeable, is misguided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
(Mr. Powell), I firmly and fiercely rebut the allegation made by the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) that only the Labour party is in favour of friendly societies. The Government are as much in favour of what I would call designer friendly societies as is the hon. Gentleman. Were that not so, we would not have published in January, the Green Paper to which both the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Corby have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper was widely complimented by people involved in running the friendly societies. Indeed, the friendly societies' liaison committee came to see me after the Green Paper was published to express its approval. Recently, we have received from it some ideas on how the Green Paper can be improved. This is a listening Government and we are prepared to listen to advice, whether it comes from the friendly societies' liaison committee, other leading lights in the friendly societies' movement or from the hon. Member for Brent, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman tabled two amendments and asked about the Green Paper and when legislation could be expected. As he knows, when we issued the Green Paper we asked for representations to be made to the Treasury by the end of March. Unfortunately, it was not possible for all representations, including those made by the friendly societies liaison committee, to be with us by that date. However, most are now in and it is incumbent on us to examine and analyse them for any prospect of further improvement. I am sure that there is, because discussions with people involved in the friendly societies movement have been constructive. I believe that the Opposition will support the Bill at least in principle, but it will not be a short Bill. When it comes before the House, which I hope will be sooner rather than later, the friendly societies Bill will contain about 40 or 50 clauses and require considerable time and work. We intend to bring it forward as soon as parliamentary time permits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked back at the debate on last year's Finance Bill Committee, of which I was not a member, and I saw the remarks of the hon. Members for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who has been translated to another responsibility on the Labour Front Bench. Despite the remarks of the hon. Member for Brent, South there is cross-party support for the broad objectives of the Green Paper. Several Labour Members have expressed their support for its aims, especially the hon. Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) who is an elected member of the shadow Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years, registered friendly societies have been able to offer small life assurance or endowment policies with a special tax advantage. After the premiums are invested, the income and capital in the fund is allowed to build up entirely free of tax. When the policy matures, all the proceeds are also free of tax. That is a generous tax exemption which is not available to other institutions offering comparable products. The hon. Member for Brent, South conveniently overlooked that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
I support the tax exemption for the friendly societies and I am sure that he does. My hon. Friend the Member for Corby mentioned the 1984 Finance Bill, which was the Bill that took the longest time ever to consider in Parliament. I recall part of the debate on friendly societies then. The key debates were in 1987 when I was not a member of the Finance Bill Committee. In 1987, we simplified the rule by giving tax relief by reference to the premiums paid rather than the sum assured. The maximum annual premium was set at £100 a year. We are proposing to raise that sum from £100 to £150. I do not claim that it is a generous increase, but the indexed figure would have been only £136. I shall explain later why we propose no larger increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the hon. Member for Brent, South to paragraph 1.2 of the introduction to the Green Paper, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This paper outlines the rataionale for, and extent of, the proposals for new friendly society legislation as a basis for consultation on its form. It does not cover the taxation of societies: that will be reviewed after the decisions have been taken on the friendly society legislation and, if changes are thought appropriate to the taxation of friendly societies generally, they will be introduced in a Finance Bill."</p></blockquote>
We have, first, to arrange the details of the legislation to make it acceptable to the House; it will not be insignificant legislation, but will amount to some 50 clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 41 is part of our package for the encouragement of savings, and increases the tax exemption limit from £100 to £150. The tax relief for friendly society policies underlines the valuable role that the societies play. I join the hon. Member for Brent, South and my hon. Friend the Member for Corby in paying tribute to the dedication and success of friendly societies over the past few years. They have been dwindling in number, but that is not because of any policies pursued by the Labour Government or by us. Rather it is largely a result of the introduction of the welfare state, initially under the Lloyd George Government—on which my hon. Friend the Member for Corby is an acknowledged expert in this House. I recall particularly the 1909 and the 1911 legislation which was all important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is making a most entertaining speech, but the

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in no sense showing preference for Corby over Staffordshire, Mr. Cormack. I was seeking to address both you and my hon. Friend, in that I was answering a question that he had asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation introduced by the Liberal Government in 1909 and 1911, and subsequently by the Labour Government after the second world war, led to the reduction in the number of friendly societies and in the number of their members, which declined from some 8 million after the war to about 3 million in 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the hon. Member for Brent, South has introduced this division between us, as I have already
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
alluded to the fact that, in previous Finance Bill Committees, we have been able to turn for constructive support to the hon. Members for Islington, South and Finsbury and for Clydebank and Milngavie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the essentially non-partisan nature of the amendments, I hope to persuade the Committee to reject them and to agree that the 50 per cent. increase in the tax exemption limit that we are proposing is more appropriate in present circumstances until we bring forward the new legislation mentioned in the Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The justification for exempting small-scale friendly society business from tax is that it reinforces the societies' traditional role in fostering self-help, and in encouraging the virtue of thrift. The present form of limit, on annual premiums, favours friendly societies' traditional longer-term endowment policies over a 10-year saving plan. At this low level of premiums, administrative costs are relatively high in proportion to total benefits. Tax exemption helps to offset them. Without it, such small-scale policies might not be viable at all. Over a 25-year term, premiums at £150 a year could produce benefits of up to about £20,000. We are not just talking about small amounts of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase that we propose—to £150—goes comfortably beyond the increase that we needed to keep up with inflation. If we were to raise the tax exemption much higher, the nature of exemption would change significantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial amounts of life insurance business, which would otherwise have gone to mainstream life offices, could switch to friendly societies. That would have two effects. First, it could change radically the scale and nature of friendly society activities. The danger is that the traditional friendly society role of offering long-term provident benefits to those who might otherwise not make such provision would be crowded out. I would not want that, and I doubt whether the Opposition would either. Secondly, the position would be unsustainable. There would be intense pressure—with some justification—for the exemption to apply on equal terms to life offices, so that they could compete fairly. I do not suppose that the Opposition want to exempt life offices from tax on a substantial part of their business, but I think that that could be the result. What is more, friendly societies would than have no advantage over commercial offices, even at the very small end of the scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what I have said about the Green Paper and my explanation of why the Opposition's amendment is unacceptable, I hope that the hon. Member for Brent, South will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see a shaking of heads, but when the Financial Secretary was the Economic Secretary, he dealt with the matter. His not being Economic Secretary today is perhaps fortunate for him, when one considers his response as Economic Secretary compared with the response of the present Economic Secretary. Hon. Members present here today may recall his response to the Adjournment debate of the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible for us to be totally bipartisan. Some people of good will on both sides of the House can be regarded as the genuine friends of the friendly societies. I do not include the current Financial Secretary among their number, so I am not sure that he should nod as sagely and frequently as he does, but the hon. Member for Corby is a steadfast friend of the friendly societies and deserves recognition for that. I have perused his speech in that Adjournment debate at great length in the past few weeks. I was interested in the response of the then Economic Secretary. The reason given then for not being able to increase the tax exempt limit was different from that given by the current Economic Secretary. Then, we were told that it would not be appropriate and that he could not accept the argument for raising the tax exempt limit for friendly society policies in line with that for unit trusts with PEPs, as the
	<br><blockquote><p>"purpose of the tax arrangements for personal equity plans … is to encourage and widen share ownership and strengthen popular capitalism."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 April 1989; Vol. 150, c. 172.]</p></blockquote>
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last of those phrases gives the true ideological reasons for much of what the Government do in that regard. They are not concerned to strengthen British industry or to spread among a wide cross-section of the community the opportunity to invest in it. They want to promote popular capitalism as a naked political objective. However, putting that aside, the reason given then was that it was wrong to increase the tax exempt limit because PEPs have a different purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Conservative Members including the Financial Secretary, realise, that argument was completely blown out of the water by the introduction of TESSA in the 1990 Bill. It is no longer possible to argue that it is wrong in principle to increase the tax exempt limits because TESSA is specifically concerned with giving a tax free saving in bank and building society accounts. In the current context in which, inevitably, banks and building societies with TESSAs and PEPs are able to compete with friendly societies to the point of destruction, it is no longer possible to maintain the Government's argument in the past in relation to raising the tax exempt limit. Just as that argument is blown out of the water, along comes the current Economic Secretary, who changes the argument and the rationale for continued meanness and stinginess in refusing to raise the tax exempt limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not overstating the case to say that the threat of extinction is very real for friendly societies. One has only to look at their history and at what happened after 1984. There was not only removal of LAPR but a reduction in the maximum sum assured from £2,000 to £750 and the figure for annuities was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
similarly reduced from £416 to £156. As Conservative Members know, that immediately created chaos in the industry. Some societies had to shut up shop while others withdrew their policies, took stock of the situation and were unable to take on any new business. In those circumstances, it is no wonder that the consternation of the industry turned to anger, which was made more poignant by what happened subsequently when one of the friendly societies, responding to the challenge of seeking to compete in a much more favourable climate of competition than exists now, sought to be ingenious. It devised the baby-bond approach, which the Committee will remember fell foul of the Inland Revenue and had to be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever the friendly societies have been beaten about the head, they have tried to regroup to meet the needs of the times with a degree of ingenuity that is entirely laudable. But the stock of ingenuity and the fund, not of good will but of endurance, have almost run out. Unless the Government are prepared to indicate, even at this late stage, that they are prepared to be more generous about tax exemption limits, it is difficult to see how there can be a continuing role for friendly societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard what the Minister had to say and we regret it. We shall, with other persons of goodwill, continue the battle for the friendly societies, but this evening, sadly, we must leave the matter as we do not intend to press the amendment to a Division.

The amendments would ensure that those shareholders would lose no income when the single tax regime for all authorised unit trusts is created with effect from 1 January 1991.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendment is not contentious, but I intend to speak to amendment No. 85. Having presided over our deliberations for the past two years, Mr. Cormack, you can be counted a veteran of Finance Bill debates. The lapse of a year since we last engaged in our discussions may well have blunted your memory of how exciting these occasions can be. I assure you that the duty to consider the detail of unit trusts caused a bitter fight between my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to our amendment No. 88, the Financial Secretary said that it was so well intentioned that one could be forgiven for imagining that it had been tabled by the Government. The implication of that remark is that the Opposition can be expected to table only disreputable amendments. However, as I hope to show, that is not a tenable position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that as the withdrawal that the Financial Secretary meant it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 85 is a modest amendment that attempts to clarify part of the Bill rather than to destroy it, as in broad terms we support the clause. Indeed, we have no great opposition in principle to any of this part of the Bill. We merely wish to explore a matter of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Unit trust with which the clause deals contains in its portfolio a mixture of franked income, which is income from United Kingdom dividends, and unfranked income, which is either interest, rents or overseas dividends. The Government are attempting in clause 43 to deal with the tax treatment of these two different sources of income. Their solution is appropriate in cases where unfranked income only is received. We want to explore the treatment of income which is derived mainly as franked income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rule will mean that a 10 per cent. tax charge on income is introduced for the first time.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
Surely such income should be tax-free to corporate taxpayers. There should be an element of tax transparency going through the unit trust. I understand the Government's difficulties. Ideally, the franked and unfranked income would be sorted out inside the trust—in other words, treated as underlying income. I suspect that that is probably administratively impractical, although I leave it to the Financial Secretary to tell us that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's solution is a potential overtaxing of franked income. As a 
	<i>quid pro quo,</i> they do not at least allow unfranked income—investment income—to be undertaxed. The clause is an anti-avoidance measure. Where the franked investment income of the unit trust is above a certain proportion and, under the old rules, would not have been liable for tax, surely some exceptions should be made. There should be a threshold above which it is possible to cross and avoid the tax treatment set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 85 specifies a threshold of 85 per cent., although I am open to argument on that figure. We chose 85 per cent. because 15 per cent. is regarded in other tax rules as a sort of 
	<i>de minimis</i> threshold. It may be felt that 85 per cent. is too low and 90 per cent. more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems unfair that everything in a franked investment income scheme that would previously have been exempt from any tax charge should be liable because of the admittedly difficult situation that the Government face in making these adjustments. The Government may wish to respond to this point now—I am certain that they will have considered it. Alternatively, they may want to return to it on Report and if so, we would do our utmost to facilitate a Government amendment that did the same as amendment No. 85 would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a point of detail rather than one that goes against the broad thrust of the clause, which we accept. It would be possible to make an exception in the circumstances that I have outlined, and I hope that the Minister will feel able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Watts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Slough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to welcome Government amendment No. 125. From my discussions with the Unit Trust Association, I know that it is particularly concerned about the matter dealt with by the amendment, which I am sure the association and many unit holders will welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UTA has also drawn my attention to the other problems arising from the new tax regime for unit trusts. The association has had discussions with my hon. Friend and his officials. The major problem is the concern that in exploiting the opportunities of the European market, United Kingdom unit trusts are at a disadvantage compared with funds based on the continent because they are unique in suffering a charge to corporation tax on their income. The UTA has suggested finding a method of allowing a flow of income to unit holders resident in other EEC countries or other countries with which we have double taxation treaties. Our disadvantage when competing in this market could therefore be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
I understand that that disadvantage could be removed without any loss of revenue to our Exchequer, as under the present arrangements no such business will be conducted to any substantial extent, so any loss of revenue from the removal of a loss of irrecoverable advance corporation tax would be notional, not real. There would, of course, be some gains to the Revenue in so far as the management companies would pay United Kingdom corporation tax on the profits derived from their management business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that this has been a matter of discussion and correspondence, and it would be premature to table an amendment at this stage, but I urge my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to continue to look at the problem as sympathetically as he has at the problem which is the subject of amendment No. 125. I hope that, at a later stage, he will come forward with a further amendment that will meet the problem and help our unit trust industry to exploit the opportunities that are available to us within the European market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Mr. Watts) for his thanks for the first Government amendments and their effect. I know that that effect is widely welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the matters raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), the tax privileges of authorised unit trusts are intended to encourage individuals to invest in them rather than corporate investment. We have no desire to penalise corporate investment but it it not particularly our aim to encourage it. As it happens, only some 4 per cent. of units are held by corporate investors other than life offices, and life offices do not suffer any disadvantage since they have a 25 per cent. tax rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious difficulties with the proposal in the Opposition amendment. It would leave many corporate unit holders in an impossible position. They would receive a distribution of income for, say, the first half of an accounting period, without knowing whether they were getting franked investment income or not. They would not know that since it would be dependent on the composition of the unit trust's income for the whole of the accounting period, so they would not be able to ascertain their own tax position until that accounting period had ended and the unit trust had sorted out its tax position. For that reason, we do not think it appropriate to accept the amendment or to pursue the objective in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Slough mentioned the alleged disadvantage that United Kingdom based unit trusts face when competing with their continental counterparts. As I understand it, British trusts are at least as well placed as their Luxembourg rivals—indeed, they are better placed fiscally when competing in third markets. The only problem arises when one considers the relative position of an individual taxpayer in a national market when faced with the choice of investing in a national unit trust or equivalent invested in his own nation's shares or a foreign unit trust invested in his own nation's shares. The advantage usually lies with the national
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
unit trust, but British trusts competing with other third party trusts are well enough placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have only just received the specific proposals mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Slough and put forward by the Unit Trust Association. We shall consider them carefully, but my initial reaction is that the proposal is complex, would require lengthy legislation, and would help only a small group of existing unit trusts which represent only 5 per cent. of the funds under management, but we shall study the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think much of the Minister's reason for rejecting our amendment, which would ensure that franked investment income, or dividends from United Kingdom companies which are not taxable in a unit trust and which flow straight through to the unit holders as equivalent dividends from the trust, retain that tax treatment if they form over a certain percentage of the total portfolio of the trust. I said that I am flexible on the percentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reason for rejecting the amendment is that one would not know whether it formed the appropriate percentage of the trust until the end of the year. It would be up to unit trust managers to structure the trust to take advantage of the tax treatment that I propose. I assume that the managers would run the trust so that it was able to do so. That is the purpose of the amendment. There would be no ambiguity. Trust managers would ensure that it was that type of trust, and that it was fixed with that tax position so they would not mislead investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rejects the amendment because of potential ambiguity, but no ambiguity is intended. I hope that the Financial Secretary will reconsider the matter and return on Report or in next year's Finance Bill further to consider the issue. I shall leave the matter there, as I do not want to make a meal of it—I wish to make a meal of something else later. Nevertheless, I hope that the Financial Secretary will take my comments to heart, and reconsider the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the clause deals with authorised unit trusts, it has been suggested that it is unfairly weighted against investment trusts and in favour of unit trusts. The effect is to render investment trusts less attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that investment trusts could lose their investment trust status, because if their income from options and futures to important hedging instruments in any sophisticated portfolio were to be significant—above 30 per cent.—they would cease to be investment trusts, and all the portfolio gains would be subject to capital gains tax. That is close to the point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). I understand that the Government do not intend what I have described and I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would satisfy me on this point by writing to me or by responding briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this issue, which worries many of my hon. Friends and some Opposition Members Investment trusts are primarily vehicles for investment in shares and securities. I understand that the use by them of futures and options for hedging to reduce risk or as a transition to purchases or sales of shares and securities is already treated as an investment. Profits from futures and options used in that way are capital

	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
gains, on which investment trusts are exempt from tax. Such profits cannot result in risk of loss of investment trust status. That is made clear in the existing Inland Revenue statement of practice, which the Inland Revenue is seeking to make even clearer in the event of any doubts. It is discussing that matter with the Association of Investment Trust Companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Trade and Industry rules applying to authorised unit trusts, which invest mainly in shares and securities, mean that they cannot do more than that. Investment trusts are not so constrained. There is nothing to prevent them from using futures and options in a way that produces trading income, provided that 70 per cent. of their income is derived from shares and securities. They already have a fair amount of additional freedom. To go any further would open up the possibility of considerable loss of tax, as companies trading in futures and options would seek to adopt investment trust status to secure exemption from tax on dealing income from futures and options. That would be an unfair position for them to be in. Therefore, there is no need for legislative change for investment trusts, but I welcome the opportunity to make it clear that they already have considerable freedom in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 37, line 21, leave out "90" and insert "50".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
Again, the amendment is moved in a constructive spirit. We do not oppose the broad thrust of the clause; we seek merely to explore two matters with the Government. The first is the breadth of the threshold that the clause contains. We believe that a majority provision would be sufficient, rather than the 90 per cent. threshold that is in the clause. The second matter involves the time limits. Would people be caught by the clause if they had temporarily moved outside its provisions, not because of their normal trading patterns, but because it was prudent to do so, for example, in the market conditions after the 1987 stock exchange collapse?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will apply when only 90 per cent. of the underlying assets consist of shares in a building society or other non-chargeable assets. That is after cash is excluded, so the real percentage could be more than 90 per cent. Our amendment would ensure that there was a majority threshold instead of a threshold of 90 per cent. if a collective investment scheme had 75 per cent. of its investment in non-risk-carrying, non-chargeable assets, 5 per cent. in cash and only 20 per cent. in chargeable assets carrying some capital risk, why should it attract an indexation allowance when it is disposed of?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious about the fairness of the test. The government have made a generous provision, but should not a majority threshold of 50 per cent. or over form the basis of the test rather than the 90 per cent. threshold under the Bill? There may be an answer to that based on the technicalities rather than the principle of the proposal, but I suspect not. I suspect that where the threshold should be set is a matter of judgment. We seek to broaden the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would extent the removal of indexation from unit trusts and offshore funds that are almost wholly invested in assets, which are outside indexation to ones that temporarily rose above 50 per cent. investment in such assets. Therefore, it would penalise many genuine investors and discourage investment in shares through unit trusts. I appreciate that that is not the intention of the Opposition, who tabled the amendment for probing reasons. Indexation would be lost if a unit trust or an offshore fund was at least 50 per cent. invested in assets that do not attract indexation, such as sterling bank deposits or building society shares, just one day during the ownership of the units concerned. It is possible that an equities fund could be caught by such a test. That could occur if the fund wanted to increase liquidity for a short time while generally maintaining a sizeable investment in equities—for example, if a repeat of black Monday were anticipated or if there were a sudden decline in the value of equities. A 50 per cent. test would create an administrative nightmare for fund managers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, our approach targets potential avoidance while leaving genuine investors free to use unit trusts and offshore funds without the fear of a tax penalty. Few, if any, funds will be near the line we have drawn, so the system should be simple to comply with and to administer. On the one hand,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
the majority of unit trusts and offshore funds never come anywhere near having 90 per cent. of their property in assets that do not attract indexation. Therefore, there is no likelihood of their being caught by the test. On the other hand, sterling money funds and the like are generally well over 90 per cent. invested in assets that do not attract indexation at any time. The latter provides scope for exploitation through the creation of indexation losses. That is what the underlying measure is designed to affect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to explore the matter a little further with the Minister. I understand his response to the threshold that we are proposing, but I do not accept the justification of the Government's threshold of 90 per cent. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the measure is to ensure that money funds are treated in much the same way as the underlying investments. By that, I mean that they will not be subjected to indexation relief and cannot be used as a tax avoidance measure while still investing in capital shore assets. Much more than 90 per cent. of such funds are usually invested in such assets, so they will be caught by the test. We do not want to deprive funds invested in equities of indexation relief, so we do not want the threshold reduced to a point when it would trap such funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unit trusts are generally required by the regulatory bodies to specify what type of fund they are. An investment trust would usually have many assets in equities, but it can briefly go down to a lower figure. We do not want people in such circumstances to be caught out and lose their indexation relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak on a technical matter and I shall be happy if my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary decides to write to me about it or to return to it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of clause 46 is to deny indexation relief on disposals on or after 20 March 1990 of certain assets as defined in the clause. The Inland Revenue's press release of 20 March 1990 states that the provision will ensure that capital losses are not created as a result of indexation. However, the clause denies indexation not only when it results in the creation of losses, but when it reduces gains. Furthermore, for some an unacceptable consequence of the provision is that indexation relief is denied retrospectively so that if someone has had an asset for several years, the indexation relief for the period from the date of acquisition to 20 March 1990 is denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many instances when legislation has been introduced to stop practices or schemes that have given unfair advantage or to introduce restrictions,
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
the new rules have taken effect from the date on which the legislation was announced or after a transitional period. I shall give some examples of past changes when transitional arrangements operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, when the accrued income scheme provisions were announced in an Inland Revenue press release dated 28 February 1985, the scheme did not take effect until 28 February 1986, albeit that there were transitional arrangements in force during that period to control any abuse. Secondly, the provisions for offshore funds introduced in the Finance Act 1984 applied to disposals on or after 1 January 1984. However, transitional arrangements were introduced for specific acquisitions before that date in respect of gains which had accrued to 1 January 1984. Thirdly, the tax relief on life assurance premiums was abolished by the Finance Act 1984, but the rules do not apply to life policies that were effected on or before 13 March 1984. Fourthly, the earnings cap of £60,000, which was introduced by the Finance Act 1989 and which caused some discomfort in the City of London and among the professions, ensures that the new rules do not apply to employees who became members of existing schemes before 1 June 1989. Finally, for transactions in certificates of deposit or in debts, legislation was introduced in the Finance Acts of 1973 and 1974 to ensure that profits on such transactions were taxed as income, but the new legislation did not apply to acquisitions made before the new rules came into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary would tell the Committee whether transitional relief should be allowed in respect of assets acquired before 20 March 1990 and should perhaps comprise indexation on such assets up to 20 March 1990.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share some of the anxieties that have been expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). My recollection is that the law relating to underlying assets on indexation of losses was changed approximately six years ago. Indexation was introduced eight years ago, but I cannot remember whether it was retrospective. Some people will have invested in such products deliberately to secure a loss for capital gains tax purposes. That is now being removed retrospectively. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary may say that that is not an example of retrospective legislation, but there is genuine anxiety that it may be retrospective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Committee Members may have received a letter from a company called Whittingdale Unit Trust Management Ltd. which makes some serious charges about the clause which should be answered. The letter says that the clause replaces a minor abuse with a major unfairness. To substantiate that, it says that the clause
	<br><blockquote><p>"is effectively retrospective … 1 day's investment can lose 8 years of allowance … Some investors will lose over 16 per cent. … Investors in gilt unit trusts will be at a serious disadvantage to those who hold the gilts directly … Investors will not know how much tax to pay."</p></blockquote>

It is an established principle that capital gains tax changes, whether they reduce or increase liabilities, apply to disposals on or after the day that the changes come into force, including disposals of existing assets. That has been done with most changes in the CGT regime. It is reasonable
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
because CGT is a tax on a transaction or disposal. It applies to disposals after the announcement of the change. It would be retrospective if it applied to disposals prior to the announcement of the change. That is not so in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that there is a discrepancy between the press notice and what is being done. The press notice said that the purpose was to avoid the creation of losses. It did not say that nothing else would be effected. The press release was clear about what would be done. The change is being introduced in a way that is analogous to the change in the taxation of underlying assets to which my hon. Friends referred. I shall closely examine their comments. If there is anything to add, I shall communicate it by letter to avoid detaining the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
