	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Kenneth Marks)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 2, leave out lines 8 to 22 and insert:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>"(2) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that subsection (1) above shall have effect as if for the classes of vehicles and the ages specified in the Table thereto there were substituted different classes of vehicles and ages or difffferent classes of vehicles or different ages.</p>

	<p>(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, regulations under subsection (2) above may—

	<ol>

	<li>apply to persons of a class specified in or under the regulations;</li>

	<li>apply in circumstances so specified;</li>

	<li>impose conditions or create exemptions or provide for the imposition of conditions or the creation of exemptions;</li>

	<li>contain such transitional and supplemental provisions (including provisions amending section 110, 124 or 188(3) of this Act as the Secretary of State considers necessary or expedient.</li>
</ol>
</p>

	<p>(4) For the purpose of defining the class of persons to whom, the class of vehicles to which, the circumstances in which or the conditions subject to which regulations under subsection (2) above are to apply where an approved training scheme for drivers is in force, it shall be sufficient for the regulations to refer to a document which embodies the terms (or any of the terms) of the scheme or to a document which is in force in pursuance of the scheme.</p>

	<p>(5) In subsection (4) above—

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>'approved' means approved for the time being by the Secretary of State for the purpose of regulations under subsection (2) above;</li>

	<li>'training scheme for drivers' means a scheme for training persons to drive vehicles of a class in relation to which the age which is in force under this section but apart from any such scheme is 21 years;
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
but no approved training scheme for drivers shall be amended without the approval of the Secretary of State."</li></div> <!-- ul --></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment we shall also consider Government Amendments Nos. 12 to 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 1 is largely a drafting amendment of the text which Clause 1 substitutes for Section 96 of the 1972 Act. With the exception of the new subsections (4) and (5), the amendment seeks to improve the clarity of text. Subsections (4) and (5) are a new matter, introduced to take account of the report by the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments which considered regulations which came into operation last November to lower from 21 to 18 the minimum age at which persons who are members of a training scheme approved by the Secretary of State may drive heavy goods vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 12 to 14 of the amendments to Schedule 1 are drafting amendments. Amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 are consequential to the main amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not selected the Opposition Amendment No. 22, but, of course, when we come to the "clause stand part" debate hon. Members will find that they can debate the matter with which it deals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 2. in page 2, line 25, leave out "and" and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Schedule 1 to this Act".</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting amendment, dividing subsection (2) in the original clause into two parts to separate the wholly transitory provisions into a separate subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not allow the clause to pass without the Committee noting that subsection (2) contains retrospective provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the reason is purely administrative—namely, that the printing of driving licences has to be done in advance and that, therefore, this has been consistent with the new minimum ages and vehicle categories. The effect of that is to prevent people being prosecuted.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Therefore, for administrative convenience, if I may put it that way, we have here retrospective law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise a further matter which arises directly from the point that I raised on Second Reading. The effect of the Bill is that vehicles below 7.5 tonnes permissible maximum weight will no longer be regarded as heavy goods vehicles, even though they may be over the old British limit of 3 tons. But here some confusion arises. Inside the road transport industry these changes have been expected and preparations have been made for them. When advice has been sought from the Department of the Environment, the Department has replied that the regulations will come into effect on 1st January 1976. But the general position with any legislation—a general position which is being altered in the clause in respect of drivers' licences—is that it does not become operative until it is passed by this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation that we are considering is an exception to that. Has the Minister considered a similar exemption to cover the following situation? Under the provisions of the Bill 20,000 vehicles will cease to be heavy goods vehicles when it is enacted. At present, however, they remain heavy goods vehicles. As I said on Second Reading, this is not an academic point. The 
	<i>Commercial Motor</i> in its issue of 6th February, under the headline "Who drives what chaos", said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many hauliers who had been told by the Department of the Environment that these new regulations (543/69) were being adopted in Britain from January 1 mistakenly believe that only vehicles over 7.5 tonnes (7.38 tons) gross now need hgv driving licences."</p></blockquote>
A spokesman for the Freight Transport Association also said that it was clear that many firms in the industry had invested in new vehicles and now found that, contrary to the advice which they previously had from the Department, HGV licences would still be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point was raised with me by the director of a company in Ilkeston in Derbyshire, who wrote that his firm employed two drivers, one with a heavy goods vehicle licence and one without. The heavy goods vehicle driver is retiring, and the firm is not taking on another driver. The director wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a consequence of this we are selling both our existing vehicles, and taking delivery of a tipping lorry just under 7.5 tonnes".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Under the new regulations, when they come into effect, that will be fine. But his point is that, having relied on departmental advice before taking the step which he did, he now finds that he has spent £5,000 on investing in a new vehicle which he cannot now use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious point, and the Minister should give the Committee some guidance on how he intends to deal with it. The present position, as I understand it, is that the regulations concerning what is a heavy goods vehicle remain in force. Thus, although the law is being changed, and although all departmental advice has been that 1st January 1976 would be the starting date, operators may nevertheless be breaking the law and drivers may be subject to prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has taken specific powers in the Bill, for administrative convenience, to make retrospective provisions regarding licences. Has his Department considered giving similar protection to those firms in this country which, relying on departmental assurances, have made investments, sometimes important investments for their own individual companies? Will he give the Committee some guidance on what the prosecution position will be in such cases? Clearly there is no criminal intent in such a step being taken by companies such as the company in Derbyshire which I quoted. It would be quite wrong if they were open to prosecution having relied heavily upon the Department's own advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a few words in support of my hon. Friend. The main reason for this difficulty is the tardiness of the Government in bringing this legislation before the House. We have known for about two years that a measure such as this would be needed While accepting that there have been difficulties in Brussels in coming to an agreement about the question of drivers' hours and, indeed, of licensing, I believe that the Government have put themselves in an unnecessarily difficult position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend has said, this retrospective clause particularly affects the small firms in this country which have only a limited number of drivers. Large firms which employ a considerable number of heavy goods vehicle drivers can get over this difficulty without too much trouble. I should have thought that the Government had considerable moral re-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
sponsibility to give a favourable reply to the questions raised by my hon. Friend because there is no doubt that this kind of advice has been given and that the changes in the law have been well presaged for many months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter raised by the hon. Gentleman was raised on Second Reading and it has received a good deal of consideration. The Department has always made it clear that the change in the threshold was dependent on the passage of the legislation. Although the hope was expressed that we would enact it by 1st January 1976, no guarantee of this has ever been given, nor could it have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is that retrospectivity in the law should be avoided whenever possible. The provisions in the Bill which introduce an element of retrospection in relation to the holding of new-style driving licences expressed in EEC terms are an exception to this in our consideration of the Bill—but it is an inevitable one. They are necessary because licences have to be printed well in advance of the date of the EEC regulations, which were due to come into domestic force on 1st January 1976. In any case, the law as regards the minimum driving ages was changed on 1st January 1976 by that regulation. The retrospection in this case, therefore, is only partial in respect of the vehicles not affected by the EEC regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take in the heavy goods vehicle threshold is a different matter. It does not stem directly from the EEC regulations. It was made clear on Second Reading that the Government regretted the delay in the enactment of the Bill and appreciated that this had caused some difficulty for operators who had acquired vehicles over three tons unladen limit but within the new maximum weight of 7.5 metric tons, in the expectation that such vehicles would be capable of being driven by drivers without heavy goods licences after 1st January 1976. We very much appreciate the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department has always made it clear that the change in threshold was dependent on the passage of this legislation. We expressed the hope that it would be passed by 1st January 1976. The hon. Gentleman may well criticise the Government's tardiness in this. However, I would point out that since the Second Reading debate we have moved extremely
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
quickly. I think that it must be almost a record for a Committee stage to follow a Second Reading at the speed of this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having taken advice on this from my right hon. Friend, all I can say is that the only course possible is to enact the Bill as quickly as possible and bring the relevant provisions into operation at the earliest possible date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Probably we shall have to accept what the Under-Secretary says on this. I should not have thought that the position was very satisfactory, and I think that he would be the first to agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My advice is that, while the Under-Secretary states that the Department was giving advice to the effect that, although its hope was that the Bill would be enacted by 1st January 1976, this obviously depended upon the will of Parliament, the message was slightly briefer when it reached his offices through out the country. When local directors of haulage companies asked for advice from the local Department's offices they were liable to get the advice that the Bill would become effective from 1st January 1976 without the caveat and proviso that the Minister has added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be of convenience, if a similar situation of this kind arises, that the position should be made absolutely crystal clear in the advice that goes out from the Department to its branches in the country so that the same advice is given locally as is given nationally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ing given in another place that regulations made under the powers in this clause in relation to drivers' hours and records should be subject to affirmative resolution. It was welcomed by all hon. Members on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important and crucial amendment. When the Bill was first introduced, it was not the intention of the Government that the affirmative resolution procedure should be used. My hon. Friends in another place, and indeed I myself, took the view that this would be an entirely wrong way of proceeding. There is no difference between the two sides of the Committee that some of the changes in prospect because of EEC regulations are of fundamental importance to the transport industry, and to the coach and the bus industry as well. Therefore, it must be right that those changes should be given the fullest parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it would be right to congratulate the noble Lord Lord Teviot and the noble Lord Lord Mowbray Segrave and Stourton for raising this issue in another place and for winning the clear concession from the Government that changes proposed in drivers' hours, and so on, will be subject to affirmative resolution and therefore subject to proper debate in Parliament. It is right that the Government should have given this assurance and that they have recognised the importance of this subject and for the proposed changes. We welcome their conversion to our cause. We only regret that they did not include it in the original draft of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is for the convenience of the Committee, we can discuss Clauses 2 and 3 together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a vitally important issue. On Second Reading I referred to the effect that EEC regulations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
would have on the road haulage industry. But is is not just the road haulage industry which will be affected. If EEC regulations are imposed in Britain in their present form, the result will be big increases in bus and coach fares, together with reductions in services. That message and that fact should be firmly taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EEC regulations prescribe maximum periods for driving and rest periods which are far more restrictive than those prescribed in British law. For example, they restrict driving time to eight hours a day, whereas we have 10 hours a day. There is a whole list of EEC regulations which are more restrictive than British regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The labour costs of re-scheduling passenger services to meet EEC regulations would be enormous. They would add millions of pounds to costs, which would have to be passed on to the public in higher fares. At the same time, British companies would need more drivers to comply with the European regulations. There is, as the Minister knows, already a shortage of qualified PSV drivers in most parts of Britain. The result would be that companies would be forced to reduce services. It should be recognised that the worst hit areas would be rural areas where public transport is already inadequate. So this is an extremely serious position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the effects on passenger transport, a subject which could not be more topical. I do not think we could easily countenance the prospect of new fare increases and reductions in services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EEC regulations also have an effect on the road haulage industry. As I said on Second Reading, the Freight Transport Association estimates that the cost of implementing the drivers' hours provisions alone will be about £300 million. Extra drivers will be needed. Changed schedules and new depots will be needed. At a time when, as we are all agreed, this country is fighting for economic recovery, the net result would be that costs would increase for the road haulage industry. If that occurred, once again those costs would have to be borne by the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with an extremely serious situation, in which EEC regulations add to public costs, both for passengers and for the customers of the road
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
haulage industry. I hope that the Minister takes on board the extreme concern there is on this side and I am sure, on the other side of the Committee, that we should negotiate at Brussels for much better regulations than the present regulations, which are now under review, as the Minister will confirm. The Government must seek a better deal for the British passenger transport industry and the road haulage industry. Recognition of how concerned both these industries are about the future of the negotiations is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should also be recognised that, not only are the British passenger industry and road haulage industry concerned, but the European industries are equally concerned. Therefore, the message that we must give to the Minister is that, as the regulations stand, they are plainly unacceptable to the industry. We hope that his right hon. Friend will be able to bring back a much better set of regulations as a result of the negotiations being carried on in Brussels. We should like some guidance at this point on how those negotiations are going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Mudd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel rather at a disadvantage. This has been a good-natured debate, and I am sure it will continue to be so, but may I begin by making the seemingly barbed remark that I do not agree with the Under-Secretary of State, who seemed to relish the fact that this Committee stage was following the Second Reading debate with such speed. While I accept that the speed of legislation may be acceptable to those who give birth to it, its speed should be dictated by the ability of all Members to find out the implications of that legislation. Certainly, while many hon. Members on the Committee will be very touched by the courtesy of the Department of the Environment in giving us a full departmental briefing, many of us are a little upset that the speed in the convening of the Committee has given us insufficient time to consult constituency interests involved in the transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the absence of Labour Members jumping up—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman.</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not realise it, but he is criticising me. The first Sitting of a Standing Committee is fixed by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Chairman but I assure him that is only done after consultations with both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English, for putting me right on that important point. I shall not pursue the matter, other than to suggest that there has been a notable absence of view put forward by the Transport and General Workers' Union on this legislation, views which I believe are strong, and their absence seems to imply a lack of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler) suggested that there are grave fears in the industry about the overwhelming cost of this operation. My hon. Friend has mentioned a figure of about £300 million, yet I understand that the Freight Transport Association estimates that global cost at some £650 million a year to be found by the road haulage industry in this country, including £100 million for tachometers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst the £650 million or the £300 million might well be contested by the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the £300 million which the Freight Transport Association estimates as the cost of imposing the drivers' hours provisions alone. The figures which my hon. Friend is now giving do not conflict with that. They just go further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that my hon. Friend has signified his agreement, because in this we have the agreement of the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, who admitted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we all agree that it would be expensive."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>House of Lords,</i> 4th December 1975; Vol. 366, 
	<i>c.</i> 796.]</p></blockquote>
There is no evidence that this regulation is acceptable even to the original EEC member countries. We know that at least one Government of the original six have said point-blank that they will not implement these regulations until they become far more flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask what is the maximum distance actually and specifically prescribed under this regulation. We are told that 450 km equals 280 miles, but then we have an equally authoritative assessment that it is 281 miles. Let me give an indication of an occasion when the difference of a mile could matter. If a lorry-load of produce from West Cornwall is
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
thundering down the motorway towards London the driver would be well within his limits to proceed to the next service station if the limit were 281 miles, whereas he would be breaking the regulations if it were 280 miles. Alternatively, he would be forced into taking his rest and going off the road perhaps 28 miles earlier, thereby losing 10 per cent. of the availability of his services to his employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discussed the matter with my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott), who shares my fears. Cornwall would be split between the "haves" and the "have-nots", the "gos" and the "go-nots", because any Cornish transport organisation operating from a point east of St. Erth would miraculously find itself within one leap of London, whereas the main cultivation area centred around St. Buryan would find itself one more hop away. Therefore, we must be clearer whether we are talking about 280 miles or 281 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also take a look at the seasonal conditions that affect the peripheral areas of Great Britain where we have bad roads and acute congestion during the tourist season. The result is that the Cornish driver at the height of the summer can take four hours, or half his permitted time in the cab, to cross the Tamar to get into Devon, which is not a realistic business proposition. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives wrote to the Under-Secretary last month on this topic, and I understand that in his reply the hon. Gentleman gave an indication that he was fully aware of the situation. Therefore, I ask him the following specific questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, as a result of his awareness, what specific representations have been made to the Commission to introduce an element of greater flexibility? Secondly, to what avail have these efforts and endeavours been made? Thirdly, does he accept that the United Kingdom Government should ignore the provisions of Regulation 543/69 until all Member States see fit to agree to them? Why should the United Kingdom find itself the only country playing the game according to the rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further complication. We understand that United Kingdom international vehicles travelling through the Community have since 1st April 1973
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
been forced to abide by the regulations by the very nations that do not impose them on their own traffic. We hope that the hon. Gentleman will press at the highest level possible for these provisions to be put on ice until they can be uniformly and universally adopted and accepted by the road traffic industry throughout Europe, instead of the transport industry of the United Kingdom being discriminated against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to what my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne said about the legislation having been brought forward quickly, I would point out that my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler) and I made very clear during the "clause stand part" debate on Clause 1 that there is need for speed in order to remove the uncertainties within the transport industry generally. My remarks on this clause are also directed to that same end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great difficulties confronting the operators, whether of heavy goods vehicles or buses and coaches, is that they do not know where they are or where they are going. They may have the destinations affixed in their log sheets, but as regards legislation they are awaiting the outcome of what seems increasingly to be a rather unseemly squabble at Brussels between the constituent countries of the EEC. My information is that, at least on this occasion, the employers and the unions representing both the transport interests in this country and of some of our partners are in common in disagreeing with what is being suggested by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot possibly understand the uncertainty unless we go into a little of the detail of what is involved for the operators in this country. For example, many of them firmly believed that they would have to fit tachographs from 1st January 1976 and have gone to considerable expense to purchase those tachographs and put them in their vehicles. Now they do not even know whether they will be necessary in the long run, because the matter has not been finally settled. I think we would accept that probably they will be, but the exact nature and use of tachographs still depends on the agreements upon drivers' hours and, as far as I can see, it is unlikely that any agreement will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
reached by the end of June. It is probable that it will be 1977—perhaps even later—before we can get any further on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main area of uncertainty must inevitably be over the whole question of the hours and conditions of work. Here the various aspects of the transport industry have different concerns. Let us take, for example, the current situation regarding the maximum hours of driving in a day. In this country a lorry driver is allowed to drive for 10 hours, with no overall requirement in any seven days. Under EEC Regulation 543/69 that was cut to eight hours, but with nine hours twice a week, and with the further proviso that it should be 48 hours total in a week, but only 92 hours in a 14-day period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the latest proposals are to do away with the 92 hours in 14 days, but to restrict the weekly number of hours to 46. This can only mean a considerable additional burden. It will make it extremely difficult for many firms to operate on anything like their present scale of charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two considerations here. The first is the economic well-being of the country. If we increase transport costs considerably—one estimate is that they already represent about 10 per cent. of overall price levels in this country—we shall add a totally unnecessary burden to the country at a period when it could well do without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, lorry driving is no longer popular with the women of this country as a job for their husbands. There has been a movement over the years, perhaps coinciding with the development of Women's Lib, towards wives wanting to see more of their husbands. This applies to Members of Parliament just as much as to lorry drivers. Over the years, there has been a growing resistance to husbands being away from their homes during the week. Further restrictions on driving hours will make it extremely difficult for firms to avoid many more overnight stops and periods when husbands will be away from their families, and—dare I say it?—I think that it will lead to increased domestic friction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one of the greatest difficulties is not just over the number of hours worked in a week, and the cost, but the proposed maximum length of the working day and the maximum hours to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
worked in a week. This applies particularly to the coach industry. Owing to the chaotic traffic conditions, particularly in the tourist areas, a journey will often take many hours longer than it would if the vehicle were allowed unimpeded progress. We are informed that under the latest EEC proposals a driver will not be allowed to work more than 12 hours, although twice a week he can work for 14 hours, compared with the 16 hours allowed at present under our own regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the difficulty arises is that if we take the limit of 12 hours, and 14 hours twice a week, with the Commission's proposals for 60 hours on regular services, or 65 hours in any seven days, we get into a strange situation. Many drivers of coaches, in particular to seaside resorts or other tourist centres, will find that they will be working virtually a four-day week. Yet, many of the hours during which they are theoretically working will be wasted either sitting in a traffic jam—when I accept that they are fully working—or, when they arrive at their destination, while they are waiting to bring back the occupants of their coach. This is bound to increase the cost of such excursions enormously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people who go on such excursions are not the well-heeled commuters who are often criticised or told that they can bear the cost of increased transport as we hear from the Government Front Bench. On the whole, they are those with lower incomes. They may find the cost of their holiday increased enormously, and they may find it extremely difficult to afford a holiday at all. We should bear in mind the very real difficulties and the great increase in costs that these regulations will cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on the subject of the time it takes to proceed from one place to another, I cannot but say that the existing road system is a factor that we must consider in deciding what policy we shall adopt at Brussels. Our roads are congested and overloaded, and the Government's proposed spending "cuts"—I deliberately say "cuts" in inverted commas—for the next few years have hit very hard at the road programme. There are those who will say that this is a jolly good thing, that we do not want any more roads. I doubt whether those people will say the same thing as they sit in
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
traffic jams in different parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must appreciate that we are not comparing like with like. If we consider the traffic conditions on the main industrial routes of our continental competitors, we see very rapidly that, far from their dragging their feet on the question of new road building, most of the major industrial complexes are very well connected. Most of the major ports have an infinitely better system of road transport than we have in this country. So here again we are being brought to agree to a series of conditions, especially as regards drivers' hours, which will put this country at a considerable disadvantage compared with other continental members of the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister goes to Brussels he must be aware of a strong body of opinion in favour, on a wide variety of grounds, of taking a much tougher line. I make these points this morning, because when else shall we be able to make them? There has been all too little opportunity in the House to put forward the kind of points that I have made this morning. When the Minister goes to Brussels, we want him to give a clear indication of what is best for the transport interests of this country. The Minister must consider the effect not only on transport costs but on the many men and women who depend on the transport industry for their livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman must realise that we in this country are renowned for adhering to and respecting the laws applied to us. He should not agree to a series of regulations which he knows full well other countries will ignore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the arguments of Opposition Members that the new regulations will increase the cost to the consumer and to the industry. What surprises me is that they are making speeches which remind me of my own before the Common Market referendum, when the road haulage industry strongly supported joining the Common Market. The Opposition's arguments about the increasing cost to the consumer could equally be made about many other sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I campaigned as hard to join the Market as anybody in this room. But I fail to see the argu-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
ment that because I campaigned to join the Market I must accept every damn-fool regulation that the EEC might produce on minor legislation. Certainly, I have dedicated opposition to this matter although I campaigned with full vigour to go into the Market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will let me develop my argument—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that in developing it the hon. Gentleman will stick to drivers' hours. We have had considerable discussion in this country on another subject, but we cannot have it here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to pursue that matter. I was merely answering the arguments of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that we know that the new regulations will increase costs, but they have a purpose. I do not know whether they are perfect. I am not suggesting that our ability to renegotiate some of them should not be used. But the hon. Gentleman was speaking about the lives of drivers. Shorter hours are necessary both for the lives of drivers and for the pedestrians and other people they might kill if hours are excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Common Market referendum arguments the case was frequently made that British workers were suffering worse conditions and worse wages than their equivalents on the Continent, and that the regulations were an effort to put this right and improve their conditions. Hon. Gentlemen opposite often accuse us of being trade-union-ridden. In fact I believe that the Transport and General Workers' Union is opposed to the regulations in part because there is little chance of its members getting a proper basic wage in the near future. They are being forced by their basic wage which—although their work is highly skilled—is frequently lower than that of unskilled labourers such as cleaners in factories, to rely on excessive hours of labour, with risk to the public as a result of going too quickly and working too long hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen have talked about the time wasted in traffic congestion. Let us remember that this is self-created and that to argue that the building of
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
more and more roads will relieve congestion is to close one's eyes to the facts. If hon. Members went to Los Angeles where there is the best road system in the world, they would find not an absence of congestion but the greatest congestion in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an obvious need for the regulations to have shorter hours. In fact we would do the lorry drivers a good turn by forcing the employers to pay them a proper wage, so that they can earn a living on the kind of hours that other workers manage on in this country and elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member arguing that we should accept the Common Market regulations as they stand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already explained that there is room for negotiation, but the only arguments I have heard in the debate so far are the arguments in general against shortening drivers' hours. There have been no specific arguments about which changes should be made. I am speaking on the general argument for shorter hours, for which there is undoubtedly a need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told about the present economic situation, and on other occasions there is constant reference to the high rate of unemployment. It seems to me illogical for Opposition Members to argue about terrible disasters and disgusting unemployment and then to urge that we do not shorten hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's argument, which I have followed step by step, but he is in danger of becoming a little inconsistent. If he is suggesting that hauliers and heavy goods operators could be forced by high operating costs to take lorries off the road, I am at a loss to see how he sees this as extending employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pity that I am not allowed to develop my own ideas and present them all in good time. I make no such suggestion. I do not think that lorries would necessarily be taken off the road. Some of the bum lorries might be taken off—those lorries which operate at present by breaking the law. It would be in the interests of the haulage industry in general to have good regulations. It is well known that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
bigger, more co-ordinated firms are more likely to keep to the regulations than the bum firms which drivers frequently prefer. That is why no industry should be allowed to operate under any conditions merely on the argument that some part of it might go out of existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great confidence in the lorry industry in general. All the firms say how superior their form of transport is, and that we cannot do without road transport. Where is the faith shown in this great industry, which has shown more growth than probably any other industry in the country? I am sure that the British road haulage industry is quite capable of surviving while paying reasonable rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, one purpose of the regulations, I understand, is to put us into line with our competitors on the Continent. It is a central principle of the Treaty of Rome that no country has an unfair advantage in competing with another. I am interested to hear from the hon. Member for Falmouth and Cambourne (Mr. Mudd) that some members of the EEC break the regulations. It was an argument used before the referendum, and I use it again now, for the British Government breaking some regulations which I should like to see broken. This is not an argument for not putting the requirements of the Treaty of Rome into law. It is, rather, an argument for insisting that every country abides by the regulations, or that we should break them as often as they do. I think that in these regulations the general principle of shorter hours would do for the workers in the industry something which the trade unions have so far failed to achieve—namely, provide a proper working wage and working conditions as good as those of their brothers on the continent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, why is the Transport and General Workers' Union so opposed to the Commission's proposals? Is the hon. Member suggesting that Mr. Jack Jones is not adequately representing his members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that all hon. Members should make up their own minds on these matters. I suppose—I have not consulted Jack Jones about this—that one of the difficulties which the lorry section of the Union finds itself in is that its members have had to rely
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
on excessively long hours to secure their livelihood. The basic rates for lorry drivers, in general, are extraordinarily low for such a skilled job, and the men have to rely on long hours in order to live. They know that in the immediate future there is no prospect of a great increase in their basic wage. It would be ruled out under the incomes policy. So they are trapped in this position. In order to live they have to work excessive hours. One point the Government ought to consider is that if the men's wages in total are greatly reduced through the cutting of hours there ought to be an accommodation in the incomes policy to allow for the reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that in bus and coach operations the most likely development, if the regulations are accepted, is not that there will be just a cut in hours but that many bus men will be out of a job, because the services will have to be reduced? Will he take that thought on board before he welcomes these proposals too much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member does, may I point out that we are in Committee, where interventions in hon. Members' speeches are much less necessary than on the Floor of the House. If the hon. Member wishes to make a point, he can make another speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly reply? The argument which the hon. Member has used can be used of any industry where improved conditions are being asked for and negotiated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say it came as rather a surprise to me, as the Liberal spokesman on the Health and Social Services, to be appointed to the Committee until I saw here the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Norman Fowler). We seem to have passed along together. I would draw to the attention of the Committee of Selection the fact that the mere action of the official Leader of the Opposition in changing the Opposition spokesmen has nothing whatsoever to do with my party. I am rather surprised to be on this Committee.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this clause, could the Minister tell us why eight hours is selected? What is so magical about eight hours for driving? I fail to see the importance of this limit. If he can convince me on that, despite great problems in my area. I can perhaps be more enthusiastic in supporting the proposal than I am now. It strikes me that in certain circumstances, after a heavy night, a man is not fit to drive after two hours, let alone six or eight, and yet I can see no reason why a fit man should not manage a nine-hour stint of driving from the South-West if that were required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the nonsenses which the Bill, if passed, would cause in Cornwall is that, if one goes from my own house which is in Chacewater, just outside Truro, via the new motorway, on which enormous sums of money are being spent, to get to this House, it is 304 miles; but if one goes by the good old A30 which has tortured Cornishmen and all West Countrymen for years, it is 261 miles. Presumably, therefore, the effect of this legislation is to encourage the Cornish lorry driver to go via the old, worn-out, under-provided track as opposed to the new modern motorway. I ask the Committee to ponder the effect of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, if it requires two drivers in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
stead of one to get the goods from Cornwall to London—and the tragedy economically for Cornwall is that we still have to bring many goods to London, such as vegetables, fruit and industrial products—it is not the employment effect on the drivers themselves which is most likely to be the problem for Cornwall—one might ask what is wrong with having two drivers as we have 12 per cent. unemployment in Cornwall—but even more firms will desert the far South-West and come near this great metropolis, this great economic centre of Britain, and desert the fringes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are past the position in Cornwall where the greatest source of income is the social services. That is probably why I like to speak on the subject on the Floor of the House. I really believe that the regulations in the Bill, if applied, if observed—and I put the two "ifs" in, although I know not how significant they are but people from the driving community say "if they are observed", and the law should be observed, and if the intention is to ignore it we should not pass it in the first place—they will without doubt have a detrimental effect on the economy of Cornwall. It certainly will call into question the logic of all the money that has been spent on connecting Cornwall via the motorways to the economic centre of Britain, which is still unfortuately, indeed tragically, London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main points which have been raised with me in the three days since I was aware that I was to serve on this Committee. Could the Minister give us some idea of what is so magical about eight hours? What research has been done? Why can it not be nine? Is it affected by the speeds that are driven? Will he comment on the economic effect that it will have on areas such as Cornwall?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as simple as whether it will employ more or fewer drivers. The effect that worries us most in Cornwall is the increased cost of transport which will, once again, affect the economics of putting what work one has to do these days nearer the ports and nearer London as opposed to areas like the far South-West. Cornwall is probably not unique in that respect, although I was amazed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
to learn that there is only one English parliamentary constituency, excluding the ones in Cornwall, that is further from London than where I live. It is often not realised how far it is from London to the far South-West of Cornwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins), I have found it hard to believe my ears this morning. Facing me are the two parties which drove us into the Common Market three years ago, and one of them has recently been demanding huge cuts in public expenditure as of now, not in 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of what has been said in a very wide-ranging debate may well read well in the local papers, but I want to remind hon. Members opposite that the EEC regulation that this Bill partly deals with is Regulation 543/69, and two or three years after that there were long debates in the House on these precise matters. We who said that we should renegotiate and argue these things out were told that renegotiation was a non-sense. We have been told to ignore Regulation 543/69. We cannot. It is part of the directly applicable law resulting from our entry into the European Community three years ago. It is the Government's objective to defer application of it wherever possible and this we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment we are awaiting the Commission's formal proposals for amendment. One hon. Member described Regulation 543 as "proposals". The regulations are not proposals; they were passed some time ago. However, as others have said, there is thought and consideration of the need for amendment of the regulations, not only among hon. Members on both sides of the House, but also in industry, in the trade unions and in various parts of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Negotiation" is perhaps overstating the position. We accepted these laws and now we are pressing strongly for amendments. We made written representations last year, seeking a two-year deferment of the regulation. The present Minister's predecessor was successful in obtaining a Commission review of the regulation. That was no easy matter; it needed a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
lot of tough arguing in Brussels. There has been at all times a vigorous pursuit of deferment of these regulations until we can get a more satisfactory settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not likely that an amendment to it will be obtained before June, and it will take a considerable battle on our part to get it. We have consulted with industry. There have been, throughout the Government's life, serious consultations with both sides of industry by both Ministers of Transport. My predecessor as Under-Secretary was responsible for and present at a great many consultations, and, in my comparatively short stay at the Department, I have also been involved. There is considerable agreement between both sides of industry that the present regulation is not satisfactory and does not suit our system and they, as well as us, through their channels in the European Community, are pressing these points of view. We are doing all we can for deferment, for alteration. It is gratifying to find that we now have the support of Members in all parts of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hon. Member asked whether 450 kilometres were 280 miles or 281 miles. In the Bill and in our regulations it is 450 kilometres and that is what matters. It is nearer to 281 than to 280. The figure of 280 has been used when talking in round figures, but the fact is that it is 450 kilometres and nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) asked why we thought eight hours was the right number of hours for driving. We do not: we never have done. Eight flours is the figure accepted by the opposition parties in the regulation published and carried in 1969. We have a great many other ideas and there is a great deal of negotiation on this. I talked recently to both sides of industry, who are putting our point of view in Europe, and putting it very strongly indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that we are about to pass into law regulations which everybody agrees are nonsense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. This House passed them into law at the end of 1972, with strong support. The hon. Gentleman probably was not in the House, but it is because of his party's support for the Government of the day, who had a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
majority of four at one time, that these regulations were then accepted. This Bill does not accept or reject the regulations. We are seeking amendment, and the Bill is a holding Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue to negotiate very strongly in Brussels. We have been accused sometimes of being too tough. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary was accused of being provocative in some of our discussions with our European friends—and I call them friends and not rivals, as was done earlier on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, both sides of industry recognise that reasonable hours of work for drivers of some of the very heavy vehicles that are on the road at the moment from the point of view of safety—their own and other people's—is an urgent consideration and must take consideration over other matters in industry. Both sides of industry recognise that. The Government will press for getting the regulation made as near as possible to what both sides in industry, and the Government, feel is right, and I hope that with the passing of this clause we shall make the necessary adjustments to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Committtee will regard that as a particularly good or particularly satisfactory reply. First, I think that the Minister's comments on entry into the Common Market were, to put it no higher, superficial, gently glossing over the point that it was, after all, his Prime Minister and his Government which made the recommendation that we should stay in. We do not want to have another debate on our entry into the Common Market, but it is superficial to relate it to this clause because entry into the Common Market does not mean, and has never meant, that one accepts everything proposed or said by the Commission without question. One of the advantages of entry into the Common Market is that we have a voice and we urge the hon. Gentleman to use that voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) talked about the concern over drivers' hours. This concern is shared by my hon. Friends and myself. He should not go away with the impression that this is something about which the employers only are concerned be-
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
cause the unions are too—after all, Jack Jones is on record as wanting a four-year deferment of these regulations. Thus, the hon. Member should not take the view that this is something not of interest to the unions, because they are as concerned as anyone else about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary's emphasis was questionable. He said first that the Government's aim was to defer the regulations. He then went on to say a little more. He talked about negotiating a better deal. He did not put it in exactly those terms, but that is what I understood him to mean. It should be clear to him that what we want the Government to do is not simply to aim for a deferment but to negotiate a better deal, helped by our European partners who also want a better deal. He has a strong negotiating position on this, given the views of many other European countries which are close to our own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise—and I do not think the Minister has recognised this—that as these regulations stand their effect upon passenger transport will be to push up bus and coach fares at a time when there is mounting concern among all Members about fare increases. Also, they will have the effect of reducing services, in particular in the rural areas about which my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Cambourne (Mr. Mudd) spoke and about which many members of the opposition are extremely concerned. They will also have the effect of pushing up road transport costs which will mean that the public—the customer—will have to pay more. That is also a matter of great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are urging the Government to try to get flexibility into these regulations. Both the unions and the employers want a flexibility to meet the needs of the British situation and the position in Britain which, clearly, is different in many respects from that in other countries. We strongly urge the Government, not merely to aim for deferment, but to aim to negotiate a better deal and to fight for British interests at Brussels. We think that the Government's negotiating position is a strong one, and we hope they will use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I, too, was not entirely reassured by the Minister, may I put three specific, quick points to him.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
First, will he ensure that the Commission is aware that in this country we operate at present on rest periods as regards weeks, not consecutive days? This is important when we are talking about the change-round of shifts, in particular in public transport. This is something which should be investigated, and some arrangement should be reached which will suit our own industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, at present, the Government may, if authorised by the Commission, exempt from the regulations categories of transport which:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by virtue of their particular nature only exercise a minor effect on the transport market."</p></blockquote>
Again, we need clarification of this to try to remove some of the uncertainty which undoubtedly exists in many organisations in this country which operate their own transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, a matter on which I should like a categorical assurance is this. Until 31st December this year the Government may make application to the Commission on the ground that the EEC regulations cause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the transport industry difficulties which are serious and liable to persist, or difficulties which could lead to serious deterioration in the situation of a national or regional economy."</p></blockquote>
They can apply to the Commission for exemption from the regulations for a certain time. I hope very much that the Government will make that application. I am sure that that in itself will give some reassurance to the transport interests in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler) raised anything that I had not dealt with. I said that the unions as well as the management side of industry were extremely concerned; I have heard both sides say this. I said that we have friends in Europe who were adopting a similar attitude about the need for amendment. I said that we were aiming not only at deferment but also at amendment. I must say that we have done this, Europe realises it, and I am sure that both sides of industry realise that this is precisely what the Government have been doing.</p>

	<p>In reply to the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Fry), may I say that in a debate on "clause stand part" in a Bill of this kind I am sure he would not want me to go into the whole of the negotiating position of the Government in the negotiations which are taking place on whether there should he exemption for certain parts of the industry and whether we should apply for exemption from the regulations. I can give an assurance on the first part of this question—that the Commission has been made well aware of the difference in attitude of management, unions and the Government to the hours of work—whether they should be eight or 10 hours, whether they should be based on the week, and so on. The Commission has been made well aware of that, and will continue to be made aware of it.</p>
