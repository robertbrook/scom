	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Robertson, I hope you will forgive me if I say something to you which I do not recall having said to any Chairman before. That is that I profoundly regret that you are in the Chair this morning, because that will not enable you to repeat that speech which I have remembered for many a year, which you made from this position in July, 1964, on the very same subject of Agricultural Estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that we should start our debate on the Scottish Estimates by considering the agricultural industry; an industry with a very great record of productivity, increasing, as an example to all other industries in the country, as each year goes by; an industry which could make a very large contribution to the difficulties in which the nation finds itself with regard to its balance of payments. If I make a speech in which political bite is more absent than usual it is because the problems facing the industry merit serious and constructive thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, I believe that the industry is well equipped. The farm labour force, what there is of it—and I shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
have a word to say on that later—is first class. The Young Farmers' Club in Scotland is one of the best movements in the world. The farm improvements scheme has been a godsend to the industry, and has completely changed the face of the countryside and allowed the buildings in the latter half of the twentieth century to keep pace with the inventions which move about the fields. Housing varies between the geographical areas and between types of farming, but much of it is very good indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is short is labour, cash and confidence. There has been a drop in the total labour force of an alarming nature. It is interesting to look back and note that in the five years between 1954 and 1958 the labour force fell by 6 per cent., but in the equivalent period from 1964 to 1968 it fell by 16 per cent. It is now down to 48,000, of whom slightly fewer than 40,000 are full-time regulars. Hitherto, mechanisation has filled the empty places, but I think most farmers would now admit that on most farms we are down to rock bottom of labour substitution. It is true that at the Royal Show today there is to be seen, I believe for the first time, a driverless tractor, and I suppose it is possible that, in this world of electronics, machines may move about the fields controlled from that armchair in which farmers are notoriously known to sit, but certainly, till that day comes—and I would myself be doubtful whether we shall on most farms, and particularly in the livestock sector, see any great ability to reduce labour more—I believe the situation to be critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In, I think, the latest volume of 
	<i>Scottish Agricultural Economics,</i> there is a study of the reasons why labour is short, and I believe I should be right in saying that the general conclusion is that wages are the main reason. Wages are nothing like so low as some people make out, and the statutory minimum figure is, in most cases, entirely academic, but, even so, there is, to my mind, no doubt that agricultural wages are unattractive and unworthy of one of the great industries of the country. The industry must be enabled to pay more, which it would wish to do. The hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary scored what was a perfectly valid debating point in reply to a Question of mine the other day, when he said that of course there was nothing to stop any farmer paying as much above the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
minimum as he liked. That is perfectly true, and, indeed, most farmers pay at least £1 above the minimum, and many pay £2 or even £3. Even so, the gap between that and the wage for the same sort of responsibility in industry is still too wide, but till the industry gets better prices for its products it cannot pay the wages which it ought to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second commodity in short supply is cash, and there is a shortage for two reasons. First, not enough is coming out of farm profits; and, secondly, the banks are right up to the ceiling which the Government have imposed on their loans. The Minister of Agriculture told us the other night in the debate in the House that he had made representations to the banks in England and Wales. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would answer a specific question. Has his right hon. Friend made similar representations to the Scottish banks, and will they, the banks, be able to meet the request for special consideration which he has made? I am extremely doubtful whether they can, unless the Government allow agriculture to occupy a special position as an important import saver in exactly the same category as those who win our exports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that those remarks apply equally to the fishing industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that they do. but I rather doubt whether you, Mr. Robertson, would wish me to go into that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may substantiate what I have said about the profits being made, I know that farmers' figures—not the physical figures, but the arithmetical figures—are always viewed with some scepticism, but in one of the newspapers the other day there was an interesting report quoting one of the recent econorrmic surveys made by the West of Scotland College, and the first few lines read as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dairy farmers in the West of Scotland who have fewer than 125 acres are making no more profit today than they did 12 years ago—about £850 a year—according to a report by the West of Scotland Agricultural College just published."</p></blockquote>
That seems to tie up very closely with figures which I quoted from the North of Scotland College in a debate in the House earlier this year, to the effect that 40 per cent. of the farmers whose accounts were made up by the College in
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
1966 made a profit of less than a farm worker's wage; and that, at that time, meant less than £600 a year. All this must show that the financial reserves in the industry are low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been recent losses—not so bad in the arable sector as those south of the Border, but I quoted last week a figure which I had been given by the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, and said that cases had been heard of in which the lambing percentage in this spring had been as low as 20 per cent. The hon. Gentleman the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture said in his reply that he felt sure that must be exaggerated, but I have checked again and am told that that is, in fact, the case. That being so, in this spring's lambing we are up against something very nearly approaching, if not overtaking, the lambing disaster of 1947.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that confidence is at a low ebb because farmers are not convinced that the expansion policy of the Government is a genuine one. If farmers really felt that the Government meant business and wanted expansion, if import saving—and I think this is a reasonable test—were given the same credit priorities as export-winning, there would be more confidence. The reserves are not yet so low that the industry could not mount an expansion programme; but expansion is meaningless, unless it is accompanied by import substitution. If we expand production but go on bringing in the same amount of imports, chaos will merety ensue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disturbing, after all we have heard about import saving, to read the latest market survey of the Meat and Livestock Commission, spring-summer, 1969, which says this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Imports of meat during the first quarter of the year were much higher than during the first quarter of 1968, mainly because of larger imports of lamb."</p></blockquote>
This is at a time when we are trying to save on imports. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lamb imports, mainly from New Zealand, were 6 per cent. higher than in January to March, 1968."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the Government have been converted to import saving, so far as British agriculture is concerned. I do not think they know how the expansion, to which they have put their name, is to be financed. Can the Treasury do it, and if the Treasury cannot, as I believe it cannot, and if the expansion has to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
be paid for by the consumer, is not a substantial contribution to our balance of payments problem worth a marginal increase in food prices? But, believer as I am in an expansion policy, I believe we have to keep our feet on the ground in thinking about it, and not get carried away like, if I may say so, the Scottish Nationalist Party appears to have been carried away, if one is to take its statement and policy seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has said that output should be raised by 40 per cent. The present value of Scottish agricultural output is £200 million. Therefore, a 40 per cent. increase leaves an increase of £80 million worth. It also says that the total cost to the taxpayer is not to differ very much from the present figure. There is to be a massive reclamation of millions of acres of bog land, deer forest and sheep runs. It is unarguable that £80 million worth could not be got from what I would describe as the existing conventional areas of production. The N.E.D.C.'s extremely careful survey gave less than £25 million as the possible Scottish contribution. This must mean that the difference between the £25 million and the £80 million, the £55 million of the Scottish National Party's increase, must come from reclamation, and this must be done for £24 million, as the total cost of support is not to differ much, and also, according to that party's statement of policy, the production grants are to remain. Not only has reclamation to be done at very heavy cost—and if the Minister was unable to give as accurate and precise figures, at least he hinted that the cost of reclamation per acre is very heavy—but the acres reclaimed and stocked must be grant aided with hill cow, hill sheep and calf subsidies. Although every viewpoint on a matter of this kind merits the most careful scrutiny, and although I do not believe that expansion could not conceivably be done, I would say that it is physically impossible to see it to the tune of a 55 per cent. increase over present levels for £24 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say a word about the hills and uplands. This is a sector in which, I dare say, the Government would claim they have shown more interest than almost any other, but it is becoming clearer and clearer to me that the policies
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
they are following there are not being effective. The net income that the farmer draws at the end of the day is what really matters. It was at its peak for this decade so far in 1964-65, when the net income of hill farmers was £1,578, compared with £1,322 today. The net income of upland farmers in 1964-65 was £1,308 and in 1967-68 it was £1,121.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman include the crofting areas and small crofts, when he talks about upland farmers and the net income?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not include crofts. This is the net income as extracted from the Department's booklet. Crofts are excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one then extracts from the table of grants and subsidies the subsidies applied to those areas alone—and this would be the hill sheep and upland sheep, the hill cow, the winterkeep, the livestock rearing and the hill land improvement schemes—one finds that whereas in 1964-65 the subsidy paid was £7.8 million it is for this year forecast at £10.9 million. In other words, subsidies from the taxpayer are going up and up and up and the net income to the farmer is coming down and down and down. This cannot be the proper way to do things. The subsidy given entirely to the cow and the ewe gives no incentive to raise the percentage rates of lambing and farming. We should consider transferring some of the subsidy on to the lamb or the calf in order to give a farmer incentive to jack up his lambing percentages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To subsidise stock and neglect the land which is carrying the stock is the wrong way of doing it. It shattered me to see in an Answer I received yesterday that the application of lime has fallen to three-quarters of what it was four years ago. If there is one thing the hills need desperately it is the application of good lime. It is no use allowing the land to become sourer and sourer, and unable to carry as many head of stock as it used to, and merely jacking up the subsidy rate on the stock, because all that is happening, as the figures show, is that at the end of the day the income is coming steadily down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I want to ask about a body which was set up within the past year or two and is obviously of great importance to the Scottish agricultural scene, the Meat and Livestock Commission. In the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
debate on the Bill which instituted it our feeling was that it should be given a chance, though we strongly objected to some of the powers it was given, but it disturbs me to see certain criticisms of the Commission from breeders of livestock whose ability nobody would question for one moment. We have very famous interests in the pedigree livestock breeding world. The bulls and cows from these herds not only produce the commercial stock on which so much of our agricultural economy depends but are bought by buyers from all over the world and form a not insignificant export trade. Therefore, I am disturbed when I see the following report mentioning a well-known breeder, Mr. Alan Grant. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pedigree beef producers seem to be growing more and more alarmed by the kind of influences the new Meat and Livestock Commission are likely to exert on their industry. Mr. Alan Grant spoke about the dangers of big rangy bulls of the wrong Angus type being pressed on the industry because of impressive figures put up at performance testing centres."</p></blockquote>
There is also a comment from another breeder, who fears that the Commission will produce a crop of officials with knowledge gained solely from lectures at school or university, without practical knowledge of cattle breeding. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These men will very soon assume the part of cattle advisers and be regarded as experts in this field. There is a danger, therefore, that these advisers will lead farmers astray rather than be of use in the sound, constructive breeding of superior beef cattle stock. They may also compete sharply with established Government livestock officers who have operated successfully over the years. An adviser, to be of any real use, must first have gone through the mill of handling a superior breeding herd."</p></blockquote>
There is a great deal of substance in that criticism, and it is made by men whose names are household words in the pedigree breeding world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, could the Minister say what sort of consultation there is between the breeding societies and the Commission? As I recall it, there was rightly no direct representation, but what sort of indirect representation have the pedigree breeding interests on the Commission?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agriculture is an extremely wide subject to cover in a single speech. I would summarise what I have said by remarking that the industry is ready, willing and very eager to play a much greater part in putting the nation's economy right. It is because the Government show themselves
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
unwilling to allow it to do so that we criticise them this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Norman Buchan)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with my usual interest to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) and his annual analysis of the agricultural situation. I waited for the usual peroration, that the ills of the industry are entirely the Government's making, but at least on this occasion it was a kind of selective pessimism. At any rate the hon. Gentleman recognised that in the darker aspects there were hopes and potential in the industry. Part of the reason for these hopes and potential has been the policy of the Government in the past few years. Therefore, having accepted that the potential exists, I must discard some of the darker aspects the hon. Gentleman painted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties facing the industry, and I do not want to underestimate them, but equally I do not want to under-estimate the underlying strength of the industry, and the increasing contribution which the hon. Gentleman correctly points out it should be making, and is making, to the economy. We should not under-estimate the willingness within the industry to advance. Both it and the Government recognise that it has an import-saving rôle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is usual for the Minister in the Estimates debate to give a picture of the state of Scottish agriculture as it is at present. To take the immediate situation, Scottish agriculture has been fortunate in a sense. For example, we escaped the direct effects of the foot and mouth epidemic and the bad summer which affected England so much last year. But agricultural conditions in Scotland can vary much from area to area, and it is difficult to generalise. It has not been a severe period, but the past winter and spring produced an unusually difficult spell, with the emphasis on a late spring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
There was dryness in the west, but this was offset by a cold, wet spring in the east, which made for lateness, particularly affecting potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trend in gross output, however, has continued upwards, and the value of gross output is currently estimated at about £220 million, or about 11 per cent. of the United Kingdom total, compared with £186 million in 1961-62. If we look back to the middle of the last decade, it compares with £154 million production in 1954-55.

On the input side labour efficiency has increased. This brings its own problems. It has been due particularly to improved technical efficiency, increased capital investment and increases in inputs of things like feedingstuffs and fertilisers. It is interesting to note that in the past two years the Scottish feed bill has increased by 14 per cent. and expenditure on fertilisers and lime by 20 per cent. All types of farm enjoyed a net increase in income in 1967-68.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hon. Members will have seen from the provisional results of the June census that the favourable trend in livestock numbers has continued generally. Although the numbers of dairy cows has fallen slightly the increase in beef cattle has more than compensated for this. Pig numbers have increased to their highest level ever. Total tillage acreage has been broadly maintained with a slight increase in the barley acreage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John P. Mackintosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend but I am a little puzzled because in the opening pages of the Report there is an indication that the numbers for beef cattle show a slight decline. Did my hon. Friend refer to an increase, or did I misunderstand him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about the retention of total dairy cattle numbers and I said that this had been maintained despite the slight movement to which my hon. Friend has referred. Later in my speech I will take up the figures referred to. The general picture has been one of general satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that there was a slight increase in the barley acreage. The acreage under potatoes has, of course, dropped substantially. Perhaps this was
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
due to the weather and the trend to low prices in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the sheep position, the June census figures show a decline of 1½ per cent. in the ewe flock and 2 per cent. in total sheep numbers, mostly on low ground farms, when compared with June, 1968. Although losses of ewes and lambs on hill farms have been higher than normal, the price increases might to some extent compensate for this. However, with this exception, stock farming generally would appear to be favourably situated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would hope, therefore, that 1968-69 net income will be largely maintained on dairy, and arable rearing and feeding farms, and that there will have been some further increases on hill sheep and upland farms, and on farms engaged in rearing with arable, and rearing with intensive livestock. It is possible, however, that there will be some pause in what has been an upward trend of income on cropping farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now like to turn to our objectives for the future. In the first place, it is for the Government to give a framework of objective policy, within which the industry can plan and develop. This is something to which we, the present Government have given special attention, and I think that the industry now has a clearer and more positive set of guidelines for its future than ever before. Since 1965, of course, we have had the selective expansion programme, with special emphasis on the expansion of cereals and meat production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry's present objectives are, however, set upon the Agriculture "Little Neddy" Report and the Government statement of November last. This has both a general objective of select expansion—aiming to achieve an import saving of £160 million by 1972–73—and a number of specific objectives. These specific objectives have particular importance for Scotland in that they attach emphasis to expansion of cereals and beef production. The statement also recognised the importance of sheep, and here the Government would like, wherever possible, for a larger part of the hill lamb crop to be fattened on the hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1969 Price Review was geared to these objectives, but it also had to take into account the country's very difficult financial situation and the consequent paramount need to keep down Government expenditure right across the board.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The Review also had special significance in Scotland, although this is perhaps an incidental bonus, because of the relatively better weather conditions prevailing last year in Scotland. This has meant that something like £5½ million or 16½ per cent. of the U.K. award of £34 million will go to Scottish farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should mention some of the Price Review points of special interest to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope my hon. Friend will deal with this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that hon. Members would not in a sense try to help me to make my speech. It has been customary for the Minister to try to give the picture of the nature of agriculture in Scotland. If hon. Members wanted me to indulge in a knockabout on the economy nothing could restrain my exuberance. The hon. Member stressed that it would probably be physically impossible to cost the policy of the Scottish National Party, and I agree. I am worried about the cost there would be for the Scottish people as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may continue my balance sheet, I will deal with the nature of Scottish agriculture. Regarding the Price Review, on cereals the standard quantity for barley has been abolished and this follows the abolition of the standard quantity for wheat last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Livestock—taking beef and dairy cattle together—represents the most important sector of Scottish farming. We have made it clear that what the nation now needs from this sector is additional beef supplies, and, taking the country as a whole, this means more beef from the dairy herd and therefore some increase in milk supplies. But this is not an aim in itself, and therefore we were right to put the extra money predominantly on beef. However, we have, at the same time, held steady the overall returns on milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's aim in sheep and wool is generally to encourage sheep production and this has been done over recent Reviews by additions to the end price. The wool guarantee, of course, has been held at its previous level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position in pigs seems very encouraging. I am glad to say that, since the Review, there have been reports of an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
increasing expansion in Scotland, where pig production is playing an increasing rôle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On eggs, all I would say is that the Government felt bound, because of the technological developments and changes in the structure of the industry, to agree with the Reorganisation Commission's recommendation that there should be a return to a free market, though we realised that this decision would be widely unpalatable. A main issue in Scotland is, of course, the question of transport subsidy for eggs. In this, it is our objective to ensure that the transport subvention should provide the Scottish producers broad parity with Ulster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now like to turn my attention to potatoes where the scene is changing. Increasing yields have shown that it is now possible for us to be self-sufficient in main crop potatoes with less acreage than was previously thought necessary. The immediate result has been successive over-large surpluses, with a consequent strain both on producers and the Potato Marketing Board. However, if a reduced acreage is consistent with our aim, and the Unions and the Potato Marketing Board both think it is, we must acknowledge that the large acreage devoted to the production of seed potatoes—mainly for use in England—will continue to diminish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems facing seed growers and merchants have been highlighted in a recent report from Glasgow University—the Hay-Houston report. To meet this situation, we have expanded the membership of our Seed Potato Working Party to include representatives of all the organisations interested in this field. I hope that they will come up with agreed means of coping with the problems. In view of all this, it is necessary for the Government and the P.M.B. to find alternative outlets for Scottish potato production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the differential price in support buying in Scotland has been a burning issue. I am pleased, therefore, this morning to announce a change. The Scottish and English Farming Unions asked the Agriculture Ministers to adjudicate on a difference of opinion which had arisen about the prices to be paid for potatoes by the Potato Marketing Board when it is necessary for it to support the market. Hitherto the Board has paid 10s. less in Scotland than in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
northern and eastern part of England and the northern part of Wales. The Agriculture Ministers have agreed that if support buying is necessary in the coming season, these differentials should now be reduced to 5s. a ton. We have also agreed to look at the question further at the time of the 1970 Annual Review.

I suppose one can best estimate the strength of an industry by its readiness to improve, and in this context I would just mention one or two examples. There has been a very ready response to the Hill Land Improvement Scheme set up under the 1967 Act. Over £1¾ million worth of work has been approved in 20 months. The Farm Improvement Scheme, a much more wide-ranging scheme, of course, has had 58,380 approvals from its inception in 1957 to 31st March this year, for improvements costing nearly £59 million, and grant paid to date has amounted to £15 million. These are all very encouraging figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has also been a good continuing response under the Drainage Grant Schemes for field, hill and minor arterial works. In the year 1968-69, 81,000 acres were improved by drainage works, compared with 50,000 acres the previous year. Included in these figures were 60,000 acres of hill land in 1968-69, compared with 36,000 acres in 1967-68—indicating the good response to the 10 per cent. supplement under the Hill Land Improvement Scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are continuously strengthening the agricultural research effort in Scotland. This year, we shall be spending more than £2½ million on this, about three times the amount being spent 10 years ago. I should mention particularly here the new headquarters for the Hill Farming Research Organisation, whose importance to Scottish agriculture I do not need to point out; the major building development at the Scottish Horticultural Research Station at Mylnefield; and the glasshouse development at the West of Scotland College. I should also say a word about the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh, responsibility for which was transferred to the Secretary of State from the Minister of Public Building and Works from 1st April last, which will broaden the range of agricultural research within the Department.

referred to the problem of the decline in the labour force. In 1967-68 there was a fall of 7.1 per cent. in the number of male workers as against a fall of 5.6 per cent. in the previous year. In the five years up to December, 1968, the total number of regular workers fell by 30 per cent. At the same time productivity has increased. This "1984" picture painted by the hon. Gentleman of the unmanned tractor and so on, is illustrative of the technological change taking place. We cannot, on the one hand, press for technological change and improvement, and, on the other, uncritically complain about the decline in the labour force. The two things go together. The rate of decline is what we have to have regard to.

I will not follow the hon. Gentleman into his remarks about the Scottish National policy statements. I will leave that to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing). We will see what she will do to throw light on a dark subject. I will not go into the arguments about Conservative Party policy, but there are one or two specific points to make. The first has to do with consultation with the Meat and Livestock Commission. It was constituted in the autumn of 1967 and it is a little unfair to try to predict its future course of action. I am conscious that it wants to carry on the widest possible consultation with all interests, indeed it has a statutory duty to do this. There are Scottish Members on the Commission. The chairman of the Sheep Committee is Mr. Walker-Love and one of the members of the Cattle Committee is Mr. W. Young. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
worry that all of this will be left to new graduates is not justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to give a picture of the industry against which discussion can take place. I have been looking at Scottish agriculture over the last ten years. In 1968-69 net output, despite loss of manpower, had increased by 16 per cent. over the decade. In 1968-69 the output was 30 per cent. greater than 1958-59. Wages have increased by 10 per cent. in those ten years. The production of cereals has gone up by 42 per cent., milk production by 8 per cent., while the number of dairy cows declined by 9 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a picture of a changing industry. The beef breeding herd has increased by 65 per cent. in the last ten years and beef production increased by 36 per cent. These are dramatic and impressive figures. While I do not want to minimise the difficulties facing the industry, we should not forget that it is an industry most responsive to technical change. Achievements are due to the ability and willingness of our farmers to tackle the great tasks facing them, where we have partly imposed by our acceptance of the import saving rôle of the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Steel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems of being a member of the Liberal Party is that there is such a disproportionately large number of farmers in it that in the four years that I have been a Member I have never been able to get a word in edgeways in any agricultural debate. When I pointed this out to my colleagues they were rather unkind and suggested that the fact that I had not spoken in a debate on agriculture was one of the reasons why I had been able to hold my seat!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite this lack of encouragement I want to say publicly some of the things that I have been saying privately over these four years to the Minister about the state of agriculture as I see it in my constituency. My constituency has a wide variety of farms within it. It has no uniform type. We cover everything from the roughest hill farm to the very good arable farm lower down the Tweed. I agree with the initial points made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) about the drop in the labour force on the land. There is a need for the Government to pay attention to the difficulties farmers are experiencing in recruiting good quality young people into farming.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
There are several reasons for this. Work on farms is regarded as of low prestige, it still carries very low cash payments, and, above all, there is a lack of encouragement in promotion and incentive facilities. The farm amalgamation scheme, which I fully support, has made it extremely difficult for someone to take the step from being an employee on a large farm to owning a farm. Have the Government given any consideration to the possibility of retaining some units of the 100-acre to 200-acre size, perhaps under some new authority, which can be let to people entering farming?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem raised regularly at my meetings with the N.F.U. branches is the matter of farming capital. Once improvement grants are paid farmers have still to find from their own resources perhaps two-thirds of the cost of improvements, and at present it is difficult for them to get loans. When they manage that, it is at interest rates of 10¼ per cent. or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult for major improvements to be carried out by most owner-occupiers, except those farming on a very large scale. We in the Liberal Party have always argued that the Government ought to establish some form of land bank where there would be special loans available to farmers at lower interest rates, recognising the relatively low return on capital investment in farming, but also recognising that this would be a major contribution towards encouraging increased efficiency and productivity in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, too, the old question of the rating of agricultural buildings. It is unsatisfactory that this is still left to the individual judgment of assessors in different parts of the country to interpret the Acts and decide which farm buildings should or should not be eligible for rating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last few months I have received representations from tenant farmers about the effect of the quinquennial review on their rents and the relationship which this has with the Government's prices and incomes policy. I spoke to the Ministry of Agriculture in London about this, because it is a matter decided at U.K. level, and I was told that the Minister was reluctant to intervene in normal arbitration procedures. Have there been, in the Scottish Office, any cases referred to it for reference to the Prices and Incomes Board? It is unfair to expect that the ordinary arbi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
tration procedure will take account of a policy which has come into being since the arbitration procedures were fixed. From the one or two examples I have been given I am satisfied that what may be, from an arbitrator's point of view, a fair increase in rent after a five-year period may be quite outwith the Government's prices and incomes policy. I would like the Under-Secretary to tell us to what extent the Government can intervene to protect tenant farmers from a swingeing increase in rents which fall well outside the national policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A matter that I discussed with the Minister of State and representatives of the Forestry Commission in December is the growth of private forestry in the Borders. As most hon. Members know, if the Commission wishes to purchase a farm for tree planting it has to get sanction from the Department of Agriculture to use the land for this purpose. No such sanction is required by private forestry developers. Recently, and increasingly in the last two years, there has been an increase in the number of investment companies encouraging people to put their money into forestry and take advantage of the tax incentives and benefits accruing from private forestry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These companies are operating on a large scale, as effectively as the Forestry Commission, in looking for land to plant trees. What is happening in my constituency is that on some occasions land which has been refused to the Forestry Commission then goes to private forestry. I asked the Scottish Office why it maintained this control over the Forestry Commission and it tells me that it is land use policy. I agree that there should be such a policy, but at the moment a coach and horses is being driven through the Government's policy by these companies. I had a case of an estate purchased by the Forestry Commission. It was told by the Department of Agriculture that one farm on the estate could not be used for forestry purposes, and it was sold for farming purposes to a farmer. Almost immediately the farmer then sold it to a private forestry company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious matter. Apart from the good use of our natural resources, it is having a grave effect on community life in some of the remoter parts of the Borders. Rural depopulation has accelerated greatly as farms are sold off for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
forestry purposes, and the shepherds and others employed leave the area. The work of planting is normally done by labour squads from the towns. There is not sufficient residual employment in the countryside, and this is having an adverse effect on these communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This week I received a letter from a farmer further up the valley in which I live, the Ethrick Valley. He had resisted this trend. This is an area where this is going on. He told me that the bad weather this year had been the last straw and that, regrettably, he had had to sell out to a private forestry company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me back to the intervention I made in the speech of the Under-Secretary. I am sure that the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) will agree that not even the Scottish National Party could prevent the evil English weather from straying over the Border and affecting the Border areas. The encouragement to private forestry which the Government rightly give—I do not want forestry to be discouraged—the bad economic state of hill farming, and the particularly bad spring this year have meant that the trend I have described is likely to accelerate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not by any means limited to the Borders. I have brought to the Government's attention a case in my constituency where a private forestry owner proceeded to plant up good agricultural grazing land with trees and collected the appropriate private forestry grants on it. He then collected agricultural grants for reclaiming the hillside farther up for hill grazing. Obviously he should have put the trees up on the hillside in the first place and, at the most, collected one lot of grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for telling the Committee of his experience in his part of the country. The experience in the Borders is not isolated, because it is happening over whole areas of the Border counties and, therefore, is a matter of considerable concern. The Minister of State, Scottish Office, told me that he would have discussions with the Secretary of State, with private owners, and with the Forestry Commission. I do not want to press the Under-Secretary too far if these talks have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
reached any conclusion. My meeting was in December. It is now early July. I hope that the Government are treating this as a matter of urgency. I certainly agree that there must be a land use policy. I agree that we want to encourage more forestry development, because at the moment we are importing timber on a large scale, but I believe that agriculture and forestry must co-exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly interested in experiments which have been carried out. I was talking to one private owner of forestry in the Borders who, because of the enthusiasm of the shepherd on the farm where he had planted, had reluctantly agreed to an experiment which has turned out to be very successful, whereby his sheep are wintered in the forest. More of these experiments need to be conducted, and we need to know much more about how forestry and agriculture can co-exist. The Government need to look at the economics of hill farming as compared with the incentives they give to private forestry to ensure that those on hill farms can keep their livelihoods and not feel forced to sell out lock, stock and barrel to private forestry interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few words, finally, about the structure of the financing of British farming as a whole. Once again, the Common Market has become a live issue. In an interesting article in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> recently, John Cherrington estimated that, if we were to enter the Common Market on its present terms and with the present rates of U.K. production, we could find ourselves paying anything up to £800 million annually into the Common Market fund. If this is so, there is clearly a need for us to become much more self-sufficient before we contemplate entering the Common Market. We ought to become virtually self-supporting in meat production, feeding grains, and most ranges of dairy products. The farming industry could achieve this, given the right Government encouragement. It might put us in a far stronger bargaining position in conducting negotiations to enter the Common Market and save us £200 million to £300 million annually in imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by confirming from my experience that what the farmers are most anxious to have by way of increased incentive and encouragement is a greater increase in the end price of the product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much appreciated the remarks of the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) on the problem of availability of land for use by the Forestry Commission. This is possibly the biggest problem in some respects that the Forestry Commission has to face. It has always seemed to have been with the Commission for many years and is becoming more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The racket which has been referred to by the hon. Member and which is known to hon. Members to exist in different parts of Scotland is something which the Government should be doing something about. It is not something merely to talk about in this Committee and then forget about till this time next year. Action should be taken. Most hon. Members on both sides must be anxious about the land scarcity problem which the Forestry Commission has to face when it is refused, in some cases, possibly, rightly, access to land which it wants to plant, it may be, many years ahead—because it has to plan into the fairly mid- or long-term future—and then finds that the same land has been made available for private forestry exploitation and profit, plus, as the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) said, the added profit from the other racket of taking a public subsidy on a double basis. This, again, is something which should be subject to a rigorous check by the Department concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles turned to his worries about the effect of our entering the Common Market, however, I had less sympathy for the Liberals. If ever there was an unconsidered Gadarene rush for the Common Market, it was that which was led by the Liberal Party before even the Tories thought it up.

If I now mention things connected with crofting I hope that I shall be forgiven for narrowing the debate a little. Certain things are being proposed within the crofting sphere which will be very revolutionary if carried to the point of legislation in the mid or distant future. Before I come to that, however, I want to ask the Minister if he can say something about a local fishery problem which is disturbing the Western Isles at this moment. I see my hon.

I hope that my hon. Friend will give me some answer on this problem, which is worrying the fishermen in the Western Isles very much indeed. They are crofter-fishermen. They are crofters part-time and fishermen part-time. Increasingly some of them have become lobster fishermen, because this is their main cash income—from fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Islands in the last few years, with the help of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, we have seen a great expansion and development of fishing. We have seen a new fleet always being modernised and increased in numbers. We have seen our fishermen becoming more prosperous than they have ever been—in the herring industry and in prawn fishing, which is almost a separate industry, and the lobster industry as well. In the Island of Grimsay off
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
North Uist the Highlands and Islands Development Board helped in setting up a factory for pond-storing and for marketing the lobsters. Everything was going very well. The fishermen were going in for new and larger boats. The landings were increasing, as was the island's prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then along came the Ministry of Defence. It decided to impose restrictions over a very considerable area of the sea in which the Uist lobster fishermen and some others from farther afield had been operating traditionally for many years. Protests were made. Meetings have been held up there. We are now waiting to find out from the Ministries concerned, the Army, and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, through their Ministers and their officials, what exactly is likely to happen in the near future. I know it is said that nothing will happen before the Ministry of Defence plans come into operation in 1971 or 1972. But the fishermen also have to make their plans. Some of them are planning now to buy new and bigger fishing boats and to invest quite a lot of their own capital, such as it is, in this expansion. It seems a pity that they cannot be told much more definitely and very quickly exactly what problems the future has for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

crofter-fisherman, since they are both inseparable at the same time. However, accepting your Solomon's judgment, and the point having been made, I will refrain from making any further comments upon fishing, except to say to the Minister that if he does not sustain the fishing in the Western Isles he will not sustain crofting in the Western Isles, which I assume is still a small part of his policy. When is it intended to have a meeting with the crofters and fishermen and the crofter-fishermen in the Western Isles on this matter of such very great importance to them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A matter which is exercising the minds of a much wider section of the population in the Highlands and Islands at this time is the proposal of the Crofters Commission to switch over from the system of crofting agriculture and tenancy crofting to owner-occupation. This is a very radical proposal and, if it were carried out through legislation, would be an irrevocable step. It would affect all crofters and their families and I need not emphasise its importance to, or far-reaching effects on, the whole of the crofting economy of the Highlands and Islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[MR. JOHN ROBERTSON 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter is referred to briefly in the Report of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. It is referred to again in the Report of the Crofters Commission. It is referred to in the Report of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland. I must say, however, that, for a matter of such far-reaching consequence, if carried out as recommended by the Crofters Commission, it receives very scant mention in the Report of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. There is merely this reference:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In October, 1968, the Crofters' Commission submitted recommendations to the Secretary of State that crofting tenure should be converted to owner occupancy on an appointed day."</p></blockquote>
There is no comment of any kind, pro or con, not even a suggestion that the Department might be examining the proposal, which I understand that it is. This passage in the Report may not be exactly terse verse; but one could scarcely call it verbose prose. I think that the Department might have vouchsafed some comment on the general credibility or otherwise of a proposal put before it by a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
body of such substance and importance as the Crofters Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Crofters Commission is claiming that there is a very substantial majority of crofters in favour of this change. In my area there was a unanimous result in favour of it, but out of 200 crofters from one estate only four attended the meeting. The others were totally indifferent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be so, and I have no doubt that opinion will vary greatly from area to area and within areas. I know that there are many who are in favour of the change, but I also know that there are quite a number who are against it. There are substantial and powerful arguments both ways, and, indeed, the Crofters Commission probably makes out as good a case as ever will be made out for general and compulsory conversion to owner-occupation. But I am extremely worried about only one side of the case being effectively and continuously put, since there is no body parallel to the Crofters Commission, with all its resources and authority, to put the other side of the case. However fairly the case is being put by the Commission, at the end of the day the weighty influence of the Crofters Commission, however unintentionally, is going to come down very solidly on the side of its own recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendations originally came in a quite different form from the Western Isles Crofters' Union. I do not know how wide a crofting demand they represented at the time, but the idea of the Crofters' Union was that crofters should be able voluntarily to change over to owner-occupation from having a tenancy, provided that there were certain safeguards; namely, that the crofter would retain all his rights as a tenant, including housing grants, while enjoying the benefits of owner-occupation, including, presumably on owner's free right to sell all or part of the croft. This was then taken over by the Crofters Commission and the proposal for voluntary conversion by individuals was converted to a general and compulsory one. It said that this should be done in the interests of avoiding mixed townships of ownership and tenancy, and that on a day appointed under an Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
of Parliament every crofter should become an owner-occupier whether, in effect, he wished to do so or not. Very attractive inducements were laid out, among these being the suggestion that on becoming an owner-occupier the crofter could then sell or dispose of his land as a whole, or in pieces, to anybody offering the best current development value prices, instead of the ordinary restricted compensation at outgoing from tenanted land. That proposal could have very great attractions for crofters in, say, the Fort William area, for crofters on the main routes for tourism and developments like Inverness or Easter Ross and for crofters in districts where there may be new industry coming in or people wanting to build hotels or motels. No doubt the crofters would be very tempted by the higher prices which they would get as owners, rather than the smaller, limited sums which they would get on a crofting valuation. Thus, the main inducement to the crofters in the Commission's proposals to buy their croft land is to be able to sell it at the current development values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will appreciate from his careful study of these problems that one aspect of the development value would be the sporting rights inherent in the land. The Crofters Commission makes a very important exception here, in suggesting that the sporting rights should be retained by the outgoing landlord on a long-term lease. This is one of the reasons why there has been considerable opposition to this proposal in the Highlands area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I appreciate my hon. Friend's point, and mention of it has been made very clearly by the Crofters Commission in its memorandum. It sets out its view on sporting rights very fairly and fully, and there is no doubt that leaving this rich and profitable asset to the landlord for all time will raise opposition in certain quarters to the Commission's general proposals. At the same time, I imagine that what the Commission was trying to do was to win over the landlords by leaving them with what is most attractive to a landlord in a marginal crofting territory, which is the sporting rights for the salmon, the deer and all the rest. I imagine that this was an inducement to landlords to part with land, which many of them would be only too glad to part
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
with, anyway, given what they regard as adequate compensation.

At the moment, Government policy is for voluntary amalgamation of crofts and of arms, with financial and other incentives. But I do not know whether this is going to be arranged at the crofter's level of operation and scale by switching from tenancy crofting over to owner-occupation. Therefore, we should take a long time to think about this question, as well as about other questions associated with these proposals. Amalgamation can be achieved in some areas by crofters who have become owner-occupiers putting the land up for sale to the highest bidder. But who is then going to amalgamate the crofts which are sold to the highest bidder? I cannot imagine the ordinary crofter, one of whose biggest problems now is finding capital, suddenly getting the credit, to which my hon. Friend referred, to enable him to buy the croft next door when it is thrown on the market to the highest bidder. This is not the way to get an amalgamation of small crofts into more viable units. The history of what has happened in these past decades is that farm after farm has been added to the existing multiple farm, as land becomes available, and croft after croft to the owners' existing estate. Therefore, I do not think the policy of amalgamation will be served by this, so far as the people of the crofter or small farmer class are concerned. Yet the new crofter-owner will want the highest price: that is for him the whole point of becoming an owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, where will the policy of making available for sale, under owner-occupation, parts of the crofts which at present are under tenancy, lead in respect to subdivision? It has been the policy for many years past of the Land Court and Crofters Commission and of the Government, who, after all, want amalgamation into larger viable units, to avoid further subdivision of crofts. But if owner-occupier crofters are going to be permitted to dispose of land, that will certainly lead to subdivision by sale and to disintegration even of already small units. There may be an exceptional case for subdivision, if one is concerned solely with finding land for homes regardless of crofting, or husbandry or agriculture, housing is still a highly important social problem in the Highlands. It is extremely important that we hold the population, and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
distribution of population, in the Highlands, especially in the Islands and the peninsular periphery of the Highlands and Islands. It is not merely a matter of keeping steady the total population of the Highlands based on a few large communities in Inverness, Invergordon and Fort William. There must be a proper distribution of population. This requires continuous Government action—directly and through their agencies, so I hope that we are going to see increasing action as time goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little depressed the other day, when I asked the Secretary of State what plans the Highlands and Islands Development Board has for promoting light industry in the Western Isles, to be told that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will continue to make strenuous efforts to attract industry to them, but decisions to establish new enterprises there must remain with the industrialists themselves."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th June, 1969; Vol. 784, 
	<i>c.</i> 251.]</p></blockquote>
"Industrialists", indeed! Who on earth are they? It is the absence of industrialists themselves which leads us to our present position and lack of industry. This is an aspect of Labour Government policy about which the Secretary of State will have to refresh his memory. It was the Gaitskell policy, it was the Wilson policy before the election, it was the Ross policy, that, where private capital had not put up the resources for industry, the Government would set up light industry for both economic and social development purposes it the Highlands and Islands. I hope that that is still the policy, and that I shall see it operating soon. Before my right hon. Friend goes out of office, I hope to see some impact made in that direction, because very little has been made by him so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the croft owner-occupation proposals of the Crofters Commission. There are extremely important and far-reaching and will virtually steamroller out of existence all the legislation right back to 1886. That would be a most serious undertaking. This is something which should not be done in a hurry, at the same time, it should not be dismissed by anybody without very thorough examination, because there are many strong arguments made by the Crofters Commission. My own anxiety is that so much of the one side of the case has been put by very able advocates throughout the Highlands and Islands,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
day in, day out; while the other side has, perhaps, not been presented to the crofter or thought out by any effective agency at all. I am not questioning the ability or sincerity of the members of the Crofters Commission. In fact, this is one of the best qualified and equipped bodies in Scotland, from that point of view. But this is not a matter of their intelligence or sincerity. There is a fear on my part that the judgment could be wrong, as can that of any agency, and, if the Commission is not quite right in this quite newly conceived proposal, then the whole of the work of these Parliaments and Commissions since the last century, since the crofters first had security of tenure, could be largely undone with nothing any better put in its place. The advocates of owner-occupation say that, at worst, the crofters would be no worse off, because even a crofter in a remote little island like, say, Scarp, while he would not find a lot of hoteliers or developers coming along to buy up his frugal little bit of rocky land, would nevertheless get the same compensation at outgoing as an owner would receive on his tenancy now. But this is poor consolation for the cash-expectant crofter anywhere, after the propaganda about the cash value of these proposals. If, in due course, we take the wrong step in the House of Commons, such a mistake will affect the lives and families of many thousands of crofters throughout the Highlands and Islands who look to us for their protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing which all crofters should all think about is that, whatever the recommendations of the Crofters Commission itself, the crofters will never be allowed to sell off their crofts in whole or in part merely as they see fit. This is not permitted now, as there is scheduling of land for various planning and development purposes. If my hon. Friend will look at the Report of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, he will see on page 76 the comment that the Board's Consultative Council
	<br><blockquote><p>"felt that particular attention should be paid to grants and loans for housing".</p></blockquote>
—in others words, that if the crofter became an owner-occupier he should nevertheless have the same right to a housing grant as he has as a tenant. Then the Report says that particular attention should be paid to
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the protection of the crofter against undue pressure from land speculating".</p></blockquote>
—in other words, that he has to be protected against the temptation within himself to get the highest possible price from any bidder for the land that he has been asked to take into owner-occupancy for the very reason that he is going to be able to dispose of it at current development values. The Report tells us the Council also felt that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the sale of croft land should be controlled by a rural development board".</p></blockquote>
So there we are with another development board; though, presumably, it would be the Highlands and Islands Development Board itself which would then be controlling the crofter even after he had bought his croft, and become an owner-occupier on the assumption that he would have the right to sell it, in whole or part. This right to break up or sell is, it would seem, now be going to be denied him by all sorts of controls in the interests of agriculture, in the interests of the township and in the interests of county planning among other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that, if this policy can lead, contrary to Government policy over these past years, in the direction opposite to voluntary amalgamation in crofter control and towards subdivision against all the policies of all the Governments over the last decades, then it should be examined carefully before it is rushed into by any Minister or Government, who may feel enthusiastic because an official body had sent the idea up. I do not know to what extent the Department of Agriculture is enthusiastic about this, but I have suspected for many years that the Department would be more than glad to shed the load of estate management. It can no doubt make out a case for that, just as we can make out a case against it; but, at the end of the day, the Department of Agriculture is probably the most popular and accepted and responsible land owner of all among all the crofters in the Highlands. It is accepted as part of the way of life, from the lands officer—the local Department man—right through to St. Andrew's House. Anything that was done to reduce the Department's interest would be resisted and regretted by the crofters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am pleading for this morning, however, is that the Ministers and all con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
cerned in the Government, in the Department and elsewhere should take the longest look they have taken at a proposal before they rush into any sort of action leading to legislation taking this revolutionary and irrevocable step, which might be the wrong one. At the same time, they must certainly look more urgently at all the other positive proposals of the Crofters' Commission in respect of new housing aid and the other things it associates with crofting problems and the croft owner-occupation question as such. The owner-occupier would certainly need every crofting help still. When a crofter becomes an owner-occupier he will not suddenly find it that much easier to get credit for the purpose of developing his own land—or changing its use—than the small farmer now finds it. The bank will not look at his little four acres and say, "This is an excellent thing to be offered for security." The bank manager will decide by having a good look at the man's face and if he thinks him to be honest or knows something about him he will take a chance—character banking. But he will not extend a great deal of credit merely on the security of a marginal piece of land, when it would make the bank nationally unpopular if it ever dispossessed the man and took over the meagre and pathetic security. The credit value of small-scale ownership in crofting is much over-stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points with which I want to finish. One is the question of croft houses. In the Crofters' Commission proposals for owner-occupation there is quite a considerable and extended reference to housing people of the crofting population who are not themselves tenants of crofts or, even, would-be owner-occupiers. Let me say, firstly that it is high time the Secretary of State looked again at the amount of grants offered to crofters for house building in view of the present cost of building houses. This is still by far the best bargain for the taxpayer that he can get in house building in this country. Once the crofter has his grant—not much more than I or anybody can get for mere modernisation of an old house, and applies the money to building a new house, which is an asset to the community as well as to him, he takes over its maintenance and insurance for the life of the house and pays the interest on the accompanying loan. My hon. Friend should think in terms of a grant of
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
£1,200 in so-called remoter areas, instead of the present £800 I can obtain in the middle of Lanarkshire towards the modernisation of an existing old house. It is a number of years since that grant was increased. A man who is prepared to build his own house, completely new, and maintain and repair it for the rest of its life would be justified in asking for a good deal more by way of grant than I can obtain for a modernisation grant. The Secretary of State should look at that side of crofter housing rather than making it dependent on and involving it with all the sweeping proposals for universal crofter owner-occupation which are tied up with the Crofters' Commission's proposals, which are longer term. He can do a lot for housing now, by higher grants and owner-occupier grants as well as help for non-crofters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could say a great deal more on what I have already said a great deal about and without even touching on the common grazings problem. But I am conscious of pressures all around me. But this is a matter that comes up only once in many years. It was in 1866 that we last had a radical and revolutionary step in respect of security of crofting tenure. The proposals before us would take our studies right back over that period and possibly threaten some of the good things as well as some of the bad which have been associated with our crofting legislation all through these years. Things like housing can be taken separately from the other proposals. I would gladly see more subdivision, personally, to provide homes and hold the people locally. There are various other aspects that can be taken completely separately from the vast exercise and complex task of making it compulsory by legislation on an appointed day for all crofters, whether they like it or not, to become owner-occupiers of land, subject to strong restraints on their use or disposal of it. There are many things in the Commission's Report that are excellent and can be acted on separately and soon. In the meantime, I ask all concerned to keep their minds wide open for a long time before committing themselves; while I have tried to point out only a few problems on the other side of the case for further discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, to return to agriculture, the difficulty of a debate like this is its very wide-ranging nature, and the fact that we all have particular and important points to raise. I have been disappointed by the present Government's treatment of our agriculture in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have support—was it not support?—from the other side of the Committee. It may be argued that their treatment of our agriculture has been no worse than their treatment of anything else, but whether on British Standard Time, agricultural rating, or even a particular case concerning one of the firms in my constituency, they have been slow, unresponsive, apathetic and indifferent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal particularly with the Meat and Livestock Commission, which has been in existence for long enough for its performance to be considered critically. I have a personal interest in that I am fortunate enough to have a herd of beef cows on my small farm in Aberdeenshire. It includes a small number of pure-bred Aberdeen-Angus. Therefore, I am in a position to benefit directly from the Commission if it is efficient and to suffer if it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general question which must be answered about the Commission is what it is doing in Scotland for Scotland. I asked in a Question yesterday what representations the Minister has now received from the Commission to encourage and improve home production, and what reply he has sent. The Answer was that no formal representations have been received from the Commission about the improvement of home production although it was regularly in touch and, so on. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us much more about what it is doing for us in Scotland than merely to restate that it has taken over all the existing work which was going on before. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
interest of our Scottish agriculture in livestock is proportionately much greater than that of England. The Minister said this morning, I think, that it was the most important sector of all in agriculture, and moreover. I think the natural movement of our food industry in this country is north-west to where it can obtain the quality both in the product and in the production that it needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Scotland should know what the Commission is doing without having to work too hard to find out. Perhaps all that is at fault here is communications. But all we hear about is weight recording. That is very important, and it has been done for years. It is an old topic that keeps being rediscovered from time to time by scientists, and quite right, too; but Scotland has been so successful in producing beef cattle for generations that she is known all the world over for doing so, and those involved know perfectly well that there is more to it than weight gain. There are other factors which may be disregarded by the Commission, to our advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all tied up with the fundamental question of control, and where it is situated. The livestock industry is infinitely varied. It contains almost as many points of view on how to do the job as there are people doing it. The Commission seems to represent one point of view, and it has its place; it is an important point of view; but if it is to be imposed from Bletchley over all the others we must consider the future for our industry in Scotland very carefully. For example, it is not easy for Scottish breeders to go South all the time for meetings, and although much lip-service is paid to consultations, no doubt sincerely, consultation as a principle of administration can never work to the satisfaction of those outwith the magic circle, if there is any suspicion that they exist only to rubber-stamp decisions already taken rather than to establish what the right decision should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one doubts that we need an efficient meat-producing industry, and much improvement, and that the Commission has a part to play. This can be done by improving and developing and co-operating with the existing systems of beef production—my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) mentioned the breed societies in particular—cooperation and consultation which does not seem to have been too successful, and in-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
novating and experimenting with new methods. Alternatively, the improvement can be obtained with a big stick and a blanket of controls attached to one point of view based in England, and relying on ever-growing, more and more expensive, bureaucracy. I do not believe that that can be in the best interests of our Scottish industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the new Meat Research Institute at Bristol, which has been financed by the Commission—although there is some question as to how much jurisdiction it has over it—is directing its research solely at dairy crossed beef. This is wrong. No one put the case against it better than the Minister this morning when he talked about the Price Review and the fact that it was right to put the money predominantly on the beef production aspect. Meanwhile, however, we are all paying our levy to the Commission to help the work of the Institute. That is one example of how the bias can affect an industry adversely in Scotland. If there is any suggestion that this trend is right, I hope that the Minister will resist it, not on doctrinaire grounds but in the best interests of the industry in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly speaking, I would support the Commission in its work as a servant to the industry to make it better and more efficient and the best we can achieve, but if we start discovering that we have a new master I hope that we shall take a very careful look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I would like to consider the Report the Minister gave on the year's performance in agriculture. A little confusion sometimes creeps in, certainly in my mind, and it is probably my fault, between the figures given to June, 1968, in the Report on Agriculture, and those given in the Minister's speech, which, I gathered, he was carrying forward to June, 1969, that is, a later year than the figures in the Report. It is important when we are considering the record that we are clear that we are comparing one year with the year before. Looked at in that way, it seems fairly clear that 1968 was a fairly reasonable, average year for agriculture. The crop yields varied, but the figures were just about on the five-year average for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
previous five years. Those are the 1968 figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened since then has been twofold. On the one hand the Government have embarked on a more positive expansion programme. The 12th November speech of the Minister for Agriculture indicated certain definite targets. On the other hand, we have had an abnormally wet, late, cold spring, which I do not believe has simply crept up over the Border and affected the Border counties. I think that it has spread up the whole east coast of Scotland, and I think that the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) will support this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member. This is exactly what I have found in my travels throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to look at the record as it is likely to turn out this year. The lambing figures are extremely bad in most parts of Scotland. In the parts I know there are farms which are down to six lambs per score. There are one or two farms in my constituency where the figures are good and are up on last year's figures. It is hard to explain the great patchiness, but if we look at the actual lie of the land, we find that on those farms which lie open to the south-east and are exposed to the sleety blast, the lambing rate has been poor, while those which are in sheltered positions and where the hirsels are behind shelter belts have managed reasonably well. I should be glad if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary could give an estimate of the total cost of the lower lambing rates to the industry. I believe that even the higher prices obtainable for stock at the present will not compensate for losses in the numbers available for sale and I should like to have an estimate of the total sheep flock at the end of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The coldness of the spring meant that a tremendous amount extra was spent on feeding. In my area I have had details of individual farm bills for the last three months, which are sometimes £300, £400 and even £600 up on the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
month of the previous year for feed. This need to buy more feed has also affected cowmen. In addition some arable areas were waterlogged when they were sown and one can see in green fields the yellow patches which indicate waterlogged land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be surprised if the total yields this year in any sector will be up on those of last year and in certain sectors they will be down. Replacement costs for breeding flocks are up and cereal yields have not increased, so that the total burden on farming will be more serious and all this will affect the expansion programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objectives of this programme set by the Government were fairly clear. For the whole of the United Kingdom there was to be a 1½ million acres increased grazing mainly on the higher ground, the same acreage for increased cereal production and much more intensive use of grass, thus ultimately saving £160 million in imports as a result of increased livestock and cereal production. Does the Under-Secretary expect the farming community to take these targets seriously? Or are the farmers to be left in the unenviable situation of having had a bad year and then having somehow to struggle through as they have on other occasions? Are the targets for expansion to remain? If so, clearly there has to be a special effort to get over the setback which has occurred this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend looks at the figures he will see the areas in which this expansion is needed. The Report says that for the year up to June, 1968, there was a reduced tillage area. The size of the dairy cow herd was unchanged and total beef cattle numbers showed the first decline since the early 1960s. The total sheep herd was down below the 8 million limit for the first time for 10 years. That is the basis from which the Minister wishes to move forward. That was for the year up to June, 1968. Since then there have been difficult weather conditions and reductions in the numbers of dairy cows. Although the tillage has been held constant, there has been a 2 per cent. drop in sheep production and the only improvements are a 6 per cent. increase in beef cattle and a rise in the numbers of pigs. This is a record which makes it very difficult for the Government to continue the expansion programme without some fairly positive
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
intervention in the next short period. Otherwise the gap between the objectives and what is to happen will remain constant or get even larger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is particularly important on the labour front. The Under-Secretary said that the decline in the labour force was 7½ per cent. and the average for the previous five years was 6½ per cent. This is an accelerating rate. To say that this is countered by greater productivity is to make an arithmetical calculation by dividing the numbers of workers into the total product. There is a clear indication throughout the agricultural community, a view which is supported by the N.E.D.C. Report, that the outflow of labour is faster than the industry can bear if it is to increase output. The N.E.D.C. Report said that nothing more than a 6 per cent. increase in productivity could be achieved without reducing the level of production that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To counter this outflow we need a much more positive effort to bring up the wages in the industry. I know that more than the basic is often paid but a minimum wage of £15 a week would be a very positive help in raising all rates. In particular something has to be done to increase the minimum wage for the younger men we want to keep in the industry. It is no good talking about the advantages of rent-free tied cottages and free potatoes and milk when it is the direct comparison of the take home pay levels which is leading the younger and abler men to leave the industry. Unless the Government do something about this there is no chance of their achieving their other targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like now to make some suggestions of what could be done to restore confidence. The deficiency payments on cereals should be made whether the cereals that have been sown are harvested or not. Where the yield is extremely poor and barely worth getting farmers should be encouraged to try to get waterlogged land back into production, irrespective of whether they are able to harvest the present crop of cereals or not. Secondly, sheep deficiency payments should be given on the numbers as at December, 1968. We should do this rather than on the grossly depleted stock on the hills now, remembering that we have to build the herds up for next year's production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should settle for a minimum wage of £15 a week in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
industry and they should sort out anomalies, one of the most serious being the higher rating of agricultural buildings. When someone specialises and operates intensively he may well find that his buildings are not rated as agricultural buildings and that he then loses money compared with the farmer next door who dabbles in this and that and has all his buildings derated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these proposals were accepted, the industry could be helped to get on to a firmer foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a great believer in not having laws and policies which cannot be maintained. I dislike speed limits on roads, if everyone breaks them. I also dislike the Government talking about expansion targets and getting more and more remote from the possibility of achieving them. Either the Scottish Office and the English Department should go to the Government and get positive action, or they should give up their targets and say to the industry that it is their policy just to keep agriculture jogging along at the same levels of production, good years making up for bad ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was very glad that the question of the Common Market was introduced into the debate because it seems that, rightly or wrongly, farmers and employees in the agriculture industry are worried about the effect which entry to the Common Market would have and all three major parties seem to be agreed that we should enter the Common Market. There is also the effect this would have on the housewife. Is there any reason why these matters should not be spelled out in greater detail than they have been up to now? If the Government are committed to this policy they must presumably believe that it would be a good thing for one of the major industries of Scotland. They should, therefore, attempt to remove the doubts which exist in the minds of many people. Whether it is right or wrong, it must be in the Government's interest to let the people know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been criticisms of the policy of the Scottish National Party in this debate. That the Government have costed the policy seems to suggest that they take it seriously. The criticisms were very few, but the policy is a very full
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
one. Thus it would be reasonable to say that much of the policy is not in dispute. One criticism was that the target for expansion was too great and too extravagant. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) said that the Scottish National Party claimed that "it would not cost substantially more" He suggested that the target was too high and would be too expensive to achieve. The hon. Member, however, misquoted our policy statement. The quotation is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government support would have the maximum effect at the lowest possible price."</p></blockquote>
We are not suggesting that our policy would not cost more, but this is a policy for an independent Scotland. It is not a policy I can ask the Government to introduce, because the Government are running the U.K. as a whole. If limited to the present structure I would have to state a different set of resolutions concerning what the Government could spend. If we are framing a policy for an independent Scotland we are not commited to a policy which any other hon. Member in this Room envisages. This published policy is a guideline backed by a much greater detailed statement. Obviously I cannot deal with all the criticisms in detail in the short time at my disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first concentrate on the controversial topics. Farmers plan in cycles of more than one year at a time—often for five years. It seems a reasonable criticism that the Annual Price Review does not fit in with the cycle. A three-year stabilised plan would be more efficient and could be related to a cost indicator so that prices could be introduced taking account of the three years' stabilised plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The S.N.P. favour a gradual move to market protection rather than deficiency payments. We should have replacement of deficiency payments over a period of time by substitution of farm gate prices. These are some of the controversial matters. The agricultural industry, particularly the Scottish section, is remarkably could not do better. In setting a target such as we have it is not envisaged that it could be achieved overnight. That would be absurd, but it ought to be in the consideration of hon. Members that this policy could ultimately be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even experts differ in their opinions, and figures. In a recent statistical survey—World Land Use Survey Occasional Papers, No. 3—of adjusted farm area per head of population the results are most interesting. The figures are not given for Scotland, as is often the case, but we have calculated a figure of 1¼ acres 
	<i>per capita,</i> which is twice that of England and Wales, twice that of Switzerland and the Netherlands, almost twice that of Germany and similar to that of Austria, Italy, Norway and Sweden, and less than France and some other countries. This is a good resource base on what is already cultivated land. Then the demand for food for home consumption is increasing also. There is an increasing incentive with over-population, for more land to be reclaimed. No one suggests that this can be done quickly but the reclamation scheme received a setback in 1963, which rather put the lie to the Tories posing as the friends of land reclamation, with the end of the Marginal Acreage Payments Scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the attitude of some landlords in Scotland to be considered. In conversation with some English Members about the way in which Scottish land is not used
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
properly, and the extent of the power of Scottish landlords they have said that it cannot be true, because the Labour Government would have altered it. It is extraordinary that so much land is not used in Scotland. Only 4.5 million acres out of 19 million acres are in use. It would not be cheap to increase forestry land and to get more into cultivation, but it must be done. Mull was once one of the most fertile of the islands. In Islay a huge tract of land is in the ownership of one man, pursuing a policy of economic depopulation. Something should be done, in the interests of Scotland, to require some of these landlords to put the land to good use. It may even be necessary to consider compulsory purchase and I suggest that the price paid should be the value of the land at the use to which it was not put, not its potential value which it would have had if properly used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a lamentable neglect, on the part of successive Governments, of this problem. Will the Minister say whether he considers it satisfactory that only 10 per cent. of Scotland's land area is used for forestry purposes as against 40 per cent. in Austria, 20 per cent. in Belgium, 24 per cent. in Switzerland or 71 per cent. in Finland? If we could take up another 4 million acres, and I am not saying that it is practical, it would still only bring us up to 33 per cent., roughly comparable with the other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Under-Secretary say whether there is to be a cut-down in forestry, because of the calculations by the Treasury on the return on capital? Are not timber requirements growing, and is it not time that we looked again at the boast which the Government spokesman in the House of Lords was able to make, that not a single acre had been acquired by the Forestry Commission by compulsory purchase? This evoked cries of, "Hear, hear" from all sides. I suggest that noble Lords on all sides should have been apologising, not boasting, for this extraordinary state of affairs.

	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great mistake to cry "Woe" about farming in Scotland. On the other hand it is a great mistake not to face up to the facts as we see them. The Minister's review, perhaps because it related to what has happened, was not sufficiently up to date with the facts.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
It is easy enough to quote statistics about what ought to be happening, but if we turn to the Report of the Meat and Livestock Commission, it will be found that, dealing with fatstock slaughterings, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although there is no doubt that the cattle population has expanded, it is unlikely to have any marked effect on the level of slaughterings."</p></blockquote>
Later, talking about sheep it says that slaughterings in April were 30 per cent. below the corresponding level in 1968 and that the reduction in sheep numbers, compared with 1968, as well as the poor lambing crop, would undoubtedly result in a low level of slaughterings during the remainder of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having set out with an expansion programme, through no fault of the Government's, various setbacks have made it extremely difficult to reach the targets. We would be blinking the facts if we did not think that the yields of grain from this year's harvest are likely to be low compared with the average we have been experiencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) drew attention to the reduction in the use of lime. The Minister lumped lime and fertiliser figures together and gave them as an increase. He was talking in terms of price, and a certain amount of the increase is due to the fact that the price of fertiliser has gone up, not because more fertiliser is being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck with what I read in last week's issue of the 
	<i>Farmer's Weekly</i> quoting Mr. Jones, former director of the N.A.A.S. saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Good farming is a system which provides a reasonable level for the farmer and his family, without resort to practices which prejudice the future productivity and capacity of the land."</p></blockquote>
At the moment the farming community is being driven to cut down the amount of money spent on drainage and in maintaining the fertility of the land. We ought all to be worried about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked how we are to help the hill and upland areas. It is time we looked at the idea of paying hill ewe subsidies, and asked whether it would not be better to get more on the end product or, by putting a certain amount of money into improvement of hill land, enable it to carry more sheep. In a disastrous year like this, the more ewes we carry the more difficulties we are likely to
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
run into. This is not entirely true, however, and it brings out some of the contradictions expressed by hon. Members when they talk about the need to cut back on the amount of land taken for forestry purposes. "While there are these arguments, the integration of farming and forestry, particularly in sheep-rearing areas, can do more to preserve the sheep population than almost anything else. It is necessary to ask whether the right land is being planed, but economics enter into this as much as anything else, and we can take this as being something which will help to sort the matter out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the announcement about the support buying of potatoes in Scotland, particularly with the increasing cost of transport of potatoes to the South and the fact that we are mainly a seed-producing country. Since the surplus has to go a long distance people have long felt there to be need of an alternation. It has come in a year when, owing to reduced planting of potatoes, the likelihood of a surplus is smaller than it has been in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that parity was assumed with the mainland for transport. On what basis is this done? Does it mean that eggs coming from Northern Ireland have parity when they are landed at, say, Ardrossan? But by the time they get to the centre of Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles that will have been washed out and done away with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) mentioned the difficulties which some of his constituents have over the work of the Meat and Livestock Commission. There is undoubtedly much to be done here. The Minister said that livestock rearing was the most important side of agriculture in Scotland. Looking at so many of the reports, dealing with the emergence of livestock rearing as opposed to cereal growing, it seems that it would be better to be growing crops than raising livestock. Economic squeezes have tended to force farmers out of livestock production and into cereal growing. As a result the Government have had to announce, because of diseases which creep into continual cereal growing, a green crop subsidy. We in Scotland would be interested to know what benefits we are getting from this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the Under-Secretary for the work which he has done, affecting my con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
stituency and myself as a grower of sugar beet, connected with the factory, at Cupar, and for the revival of the sugar beet industry in Scotland. The industry will require more and more mechanisation to succeed. If farmers are to spend several hundreds of pounds on the best machines to mechanise this crop they want to be certain that there is at least a six-year future ahead of the factory at Cupar. Otherwise they will not be able to afford to spend the amount of money necessary to make the project economic. All the growers, and we had a very good demonstration by the B.S.C. at Whitsun, are keen to go ahead and increase acreage. This requires forward planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we rate intensive buildings and penalise those who use the most up-to-date methods then we put a brake on the expansion of the industry. One of the oddities of our agricultural support is that we spend millions of pounds helping farmers but the greatest increases in production have been in such things as eggs and broiler chickens, which have been outside the support programme. This leads me to wonder whether we are spending our money in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an appropriate occasion on which to say why we as Conservatives urge the country in general, and the farming industry in particular, carefully to examine the measures we adopt to help and support agriculture. We do this to make certain that we meet the expansion targets which many of us think are on the low side as at present set. The all-party Select Committee on Agriculture expressed the united view that British agriculture could do much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present system, the bulk of the money goes to the largest firms. Leaving aside production grants for hill areas, the bulk of the money paid in agricultural support goes to the largest units and, possibly as a result, to the more efficient units. Looking to the expansion that we need, are we certain that this is how we are to achieve that expension if we go on doing this? We should not get bogged down in too much inter-party rivalry. We should get politicians of all parties to sit down with farmers and try to assess whether a system which was evolved 20 or 25 years ago will be the best system for the next 20 or 25 years. Unless we do
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
this, we shall let the industry down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing like responsibility to make people reach responsible decisions. I think that agricultural policy will pass into the hands of the Conservatives in a very short time. Therefore, we feel this responsibility, and it is no good advocating policies which, nice though they may sound to people who do not have practical experience—the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) should recognise this—are not practical propositions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, no. I said that I thought that it was up to politicians of all parties to sit down with the farming community and assess the best way of going about it.

The amount of food which we cannot grow and which we must import, as our population increases will rise. As the standard of living increases, people will spend more on imported foods. Therefore, there is a real job of import saving for agriculture to do. Let us combine to see that this job is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we shall make the required progress unless it is acknowledged that there has been a major setback because of the bad weather this year. We should reappraise how we are to start to get a better level of production to meet the targets. I do not believe that the targets can be met in the time forecast in November of last year. This does not mean that the targets cannot be met, but they will be met only if the situation is recognised and reappraised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to the remarkable speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh). He performed the very useful and necessary function of analysing the assessment which has been made and posing the problems which arise from it. I accept his posing of the problems, but he will not expect me to follow some of his conclusions. He said that the requirements have now altered the possibilities of the expansion programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute also to the maiden speech on agriculture made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel), who has been hiding his agricultural light under a bushel for far too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst agreeing that confidence is needed in the industry, I cannot agree that the kind of confidence the industry requires can be achieved by following the policy which has been advocated by hon. Members opposite. Perhaps confidence has tended to return a little since the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has been stomping round Scotland hauling the flag down rapidly on Tory policy. The withdrawal of the various guaranteed prices would not give the industry the confidence it needs, although I liked the phrase about the safety net which was used in the interesting article from which I read.

I accept and reinforce the point made about lime. In common with other hon. Members, I would have preferred to see a bigger intake of lime.

The question of a transport subvention on eggs is still in course of discussion. Our aim is broad parity for Ulster and Orkney producers with mainland producers. The question of what should be done and at what level is still under discussion.

Any decisions about sugar beet are primarly a matter for the British Sugar Corporation. We are, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, currently discussing with the Corporation questions affecting the industry in England and in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the problems arising in the hills and uplands and to the ancillary question of crofting. The problem facing the hills and uplands in terms of lambing should not be exaggerated. We are not facing a disaster. In the 1969 returns the number of lambs is down by 3 per cent. for Scotland as a whole. The hill lamb
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
figure—that comes within this total—is down by 4½ per cent. There has been a sharp variation. I do not dispute the figures given by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian, but it would be wrong to think of this as a total disaster position. I was interested in the analysis made of the areas where this was happening. The point made about the shelter-belt helping to improve and transform the situation should be taken up for general purposes in an effort to make an improvement here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crofters Commission has made proposals which have by no means had a unanimously similar reception. Strong views are held on each side by people who are equally representative of crofting interests. It would be wrong to assume that proposals made by the Commission arise only from views held by the Commission and are not strongly and powerfully supported by a number of crofters. It would be wrong to think that these are mere bureaucratic proposals emanating from Government or a Commission. I take the point about the proposals made by the Federation being voluntary. I agree that the best thing to do in this situation is to take a very long look at this before acting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked to have followed the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) on the problems of the fishermen of Grimsay. I cannot follow them as they are lobster fishermen, but I may follow them as they are crofters. I understand that there will be a further meeting early in August at which points of view can be put forward. Discussions have taken place in an effort to meet the needs of the fishermen there. Not only is there the point about the needs of the lobster fishermen. There is also the question for employment of people on the islands through development. I know my hon. Friend's view of such development in general. We are trying to achieve the right kind of assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) was a little unfair to the Livestock Commission. It has been in existence for only a short time. It is far too early to say that its work has been pointless. He spoke of a new master with only one point of view. The Commission has absorbed, and is continuing, the work of

	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
P.I.D.A. The work of the Beef Recording Association has been taken over by the Commission. The Commission is also doing work in connection with sheep, and this has its headquarters in Perth. We do not help the Commission by attacking it so fiercely before it has got off the ground. It has a statutory obligation to consult the industry and desires to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong for politicians to evolve policy whilst sitting behind desks. This is precisely why I spend so much time in discussion with farmers. In relation to the problems affecting hill and upland farmers, the initiative came from me to have a round table discussion at which we would consider all problems, including that of reclamation, to see how we could deal with the industry. I have made it clear that I welcome individual views from individual farmers put directly to me. This process is happening on a larger scale than ever before. Hon. Members opposite will admit that I receive such advice from individual farmers because I have encouraged and welcomed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->

As there have been so many references to it, I must make a brief reference to the policy of the Scottish National Party. I would have preferred not to have done so. I would much have preferred to have discussed serious aspects of agriculture rather than points which do not form a policy basically designed for farmers, but for some other reason. We cannot continue in politics on a kind of Walter Mitty—or Walter MacMitty—situation. It is not good enough to say, "Because we think a thing is so, therefore it is so." That is the basis of the S.N.P.'s agricultural policy. For example, the party's manifesto says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Already we are more self-sufficient than the United Kingdom in all the main agricultural products, as the following table shows."</p></blockquote>
The following table omits cereals. In other words, "We are not to eat bread" is almost the policy being advanced. The mere wanting of a thing to be so does not make it so. The cost of reclamation would be astronomical. I have been keen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
