	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mrs. Angela Browning)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations 1997.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations 1997.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations for discussion today complete the United Kingdom's implementation of Community rules for the authorisation of agricultural pesticides. They also make minor, but worthwhile, clarifications and amendments to the United Kingdom's continuing national pesticides regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before describing the new legislation, I shall set it in the context of the Government's overall approach to the control of pesticides. The Government recognise that, although pesticides can bring many benefits, they are potentially hazardous. They are therefore determined to ensure that all pesticides used in this country are used safely, thus protecting people and the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pesticides safety was first put on a statutory footing with the passage of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. The powers provided by that Act were put into effect by the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986, under which a scheme was established to ensure the safety and effectiveness of pesticides. Under those statutory arrangements, pesticide companies must provide a wide range of scientific data for scrutiny by the Pesticides Safety Directorate or the Health and Safety Executive and the independent experts of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only when the advisory committee is satisfied, on the basis of that expert advice, that a product can be used without unacceptable risk to people or to the environment, will Ministers give approval to the product. Approved pesticides are subject to routine review and may be reviewed at any time if evidence emerges concerning their safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1991, the EC made its own legislation for what are termed "plant protection products"—broadly, agricultural pesticides. Other products controlled by
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
our national pesticides legislation will be picked up by the proposed European Community regime for biocidal products. I am pleased to say that the main elements of the EC arrangements for plant protection products set out in Council directive 91/414 draw heavily on UK experience. The EC scheme therefore provides for a system of authorisation to ensure that plant protection products on the European market are safe and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eventual result of the EC legislation should be a common set of rules that deliver consistent high standards of protection for people and the environment and provide pesticide manufacturers and users with a level playing field. However, EC rules will apply to a given chemical only when the Community has evaluated or reviewed its safety. The review process for existing chemicals is a very large task and the transition from national to EC rules will, therefore, take a considerable number of years to complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed rules for the authorisation of chemicals and products set out in directive 91/414 were implemented in the UK in the Plant Protection Products Regulations 1995. However, it was not possible to provide in those regulations for control and enforcement measures, which the directive requires, but does not spell out in detail. It is the provision of those measures that is the principle purpose of the Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations 1997, which are before the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the transition from regulation under the UK rules to regulation under EC rules will take a long time, it is sensible to make the control and enforcement regimes accompanying the two systems as similar as possible. The control and enforcement measures to be established for the EC regime are, therefore, modelled as closely as possible on the present UK arrangements, which have proved effective and are familiar to industry and enforcement bodies alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the EC control and enforcement arrangements provided an opportunity to review the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 in the light of experience. We saw advantage in making a number of generally minor amendments and clarifications to the 1986 regulations, which is the purpose of the draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall describe the provisions of the regulations in a little more detail. The draft Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations would enable an effective control and enforcement regime to be applied to the marketing and use of plant protection products. As under the 1986 regulations, the advertisement and storage of plant protection products would require approval. The new regulations would also apply general conditions to the advertisement, storage, sale, supply and use of any product subject to the EC regime and would allow for the seizure and disposal of plant protection products following contravention of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
All those provisions follow the blueprint of existing UK rules. Existing powers under the 1985 Act to prescribe codes of practice and to provide powers for enforcement officers will apply to products regulated under the EC regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations would clarify the scope and content of the 1986 regulations. Most of the amendments are minor and technical, but a few are worthy of specific mention. The new regulations would specifically exclude pesticides acting by physical means—devices such as glues that stick pests or greases that repel them. The rigorous arrangements applied to normal chemical or microbiological pesticides are not appropriate to that small sector of the market. We have, therefore, taken the opportunity to deregulate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following detailed public consultation, we are also taking the opportunity to achieve substantial clarification of the rules as they apply to adjuvants. Those are substances without significant pesticidal properties of their own that, when used with a pesticide, significantly increase its effectiveness. The existing rules on adjuvants have given rise to some confusion as to how and to what extent they are controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft regulations would make it clear that an adjuvant may be used with a pesticide only if that adjuvant is on the authorised list and is used in accordance with the conditions given in the list and the conditions of use of the pesticide. The regulations would also make it clear that Ministers may remove an adjuvant from the authorised list if it is marketed outside its authorisation, or if human safety or environmental safety concerns are identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 and the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 put in place a thorough and effective statutory system for the regulation of pesticides. We have started the transition of provisions for agricultural pesticides from those UK rules to EC arrangements that will provide similar safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations would complete the UK's implementation of those EC rules. By following the existing UK regime for control and enforcement, we can be confident that we shall have a system that is workable and well understood. The draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations would make minor clarifications to the UK regime. I commend both sets of regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.39 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure, Mrs. Winterton, to serve under your chairmanship. The measures are sensible and in many ways represent an improvement on the current situation. I do not want to make any major criticism of the regulations; what I want from the Minister is further clarification of some aspects of them and how they will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained how the plant protection regulations would operate, but I notice that they refer to micro-organisms. Will she say how the regulations
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
will apply to other committees, such as the release committee, which regulate the release of microorganisms into the wild? There are strict regulations on genetically modified organisms and how they may be released and controlled—that is right and proper. I may be wrong in my interpretation of the regulations, which is why I should like the Minister to clarify the matter, but, in theory, a manufacturer could import a micro-organism that is non-native to this country. I know that there are Department of the Environment and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regulations on the importation of non-native species and micro-organisms, but how will they relate to the regulations that we are considering, to ensure that non-native micro-organisms that may have implications for the wider environment are not used, perhaps as a measure of biological control? I should be grateful for clarification on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the regulations give powers to deal with the storage, seizure and disposal of chemicals and products that do not comply with other regulations set down by the Ministry. The Minister will be aware, however, that a problem remains concerning the delay in reviewing pesticides, which she mentioned. For example, some farmers may store on their premises pesticides that are dangerous and long out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Ministry and the Department of the Environment have run a good campaign on the illegal poisoning of birds of prey—they deserve to be commended for drawing the matter to the attention of landowners and farmers. The problem persists, however, and I ask the Minister to say what powers the Ministry has on that and whether it is trying to ensure that dangerous, time-expired pesticides are not being stored on farms but being collected and disposed of. Some of those chemicals are so dangerous that we need to consider carefully how they are disposed of and I believe that the Ministry needs to give serious attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the Minister's comments about the changes to schedule 4 in respect of aerial spraying. Those changes are welcome, as is the details in the schedule on regulating the use of aerial sprays. That is a matter of concern in areas such as Lincolnsire, where there is intensive agriculture and aerial spraying is not uncommon. Will the Minister say what resources are available for MAFF to enforce the schedule 4 regulations, which are extremely detailed, requiring those involved in aerial spraying to keep records? I am sure that most contractors are entirely reputable and I am glad to note that the number of complaints about aerial spraying has declined in recent years—I suspect that that is not unrelated to regulations of this kind—but will the Minister say how the measures are enforced? How is record keeping checked to ensure that the regulations are being properly applied?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some concerns about the control of pesticides regulations, about which I hope the Minsiter can reassure me. She mentioned deregulation and what it would apply to. Again, this might be a matter of interpretation, but regulation 4, which deals with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
scope of the provisions, lists what the regulations do not apply to, including "organisms other than bacteria" and
	<br><blockquote><p>"substances, preparations or organisms whose use or sale within the United Kingdom is controlled under"</p></blockquote>
various other pieces of legislation. That is fine, but the regulations then mention a range of other exemptions, such as chemicals used
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the preservation of timber or timber products, the production of food or the treatment of seed".</p></blockquote>
Some nasty chemicals are used in such work, but, unless I have it wrong, the regulations will not apply to them. The regulations also exempt chemicals used
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of preventing the fouling of the hulls of vessels or structures below the waterline".</p></blockquote>
Again, powerful chemicals are involved, and there are implications for seabed fauna and flora.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also exempt
	<br><blockquote><p>"the treatment of nets, floats or other apparatus"—</p></blockquote>
again, powerful chemicals are involved—and even exempt chemicals
	<br><blockquote><p>"used in preparations intended for topical application to human beings for the purposes of repelling insects".</p></blockquote>
That includes chemicals such as diet. I know that they are regulated, but will the Minister explain why they are not included in these regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in diet because I went on a scientific study in Finland, where there are many mosquitos, and I was worried because the repellent that I was using dissolved my watch strap. Whatever is in that repellent needs very careful regulation if it dissolves watch straps. So I would be grateful if the Minister would explain why the regulations do not apply to that entire list of chemicals. In animal husbandry, sprays have been developed for parasite control which, again, contain powerful chemicals. They may also be covered by different regulations, but I would be grateful if the Minister would explain the relationship between these regulations and existing regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I warmly welcome the provision in the regulations for greater public access to information. That is a great step forward. People are entitled to information about chemicals, and in particular to the scientific papers and advice that the Ministry has received. That will be made available to the public, which is to be welcomed, and I am sure that people will appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.47 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not attempt to cover all the ground already covered by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), including his opening complimentary remarks, but I also welcome the attempt to clarify the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some specific points to make, to which I shall come in a moment, but I shall first make a couple of general points. I am more concerned with the draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations than with the draft Plant Protection Product (Basic
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Conditions) Regulations—for reason that will become apparent—but these general points may be appropriate to both of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be satisfied with simply tidying up the existing situation. There is increasingly public concern about the cumulative effect of pesticides. Getting an individual control of pesticide regulation right is only a proportion of the work before us. We should be concerned with the long-term effect of using a number of pesticides in a number of ways; scientists are increasingly concerned about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also concern about how some products change their character when they move from the laboratory to mass manufacture. I know that you, Mrs. Winterton, have experience in agriculture, and I know that many farmers are concerned that while the original approval systems may be as accurate, effective and foolproof as we can possibly make them, there can be difficulties once products move into mass manufacture. The introduction of tiny amounts of additional ingredients to the stew, as it were, can dramatically change the character of a product, making its pollutant effect that much worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned about the sale, supply, storage and use of one particular type of pesticide, but before I come to that, I want to mention a couple of other points. I noted, accept and appreciate the significance of what the Minister said about the de minimis provisions of the regulations, but I am thinking in particular of draft regulation 3(2)(h) of the draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations, to which the Minister referred, and which exempts
	<br><blockquote><p>"substances, preparations or organisms designed and used for destroying or controlling pests by purely physical means"—</p></blockquote>
I heard a Conservative Member say "Flypaper" sotto voce. That is an interesting example of public concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the application and use of such products might principally be physical, they contain chemicals, of course. Some chemicals used in such preparations can trigger a major allergic reaction in some people, and simply knowing what substances are present and what must be done is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some farmers—you might have experience of this, Mrs. Winterton, as you represent an agricultural area—have been affected by long-term exposure to organophosphorous sheep dips. They and their families have found that exposure in the household to tiny quantities of some products can trigger a major allergic reaction. Therefore, we should be extremely careful. In the interests of deregulation, we should try to remove excessive controls on things that do not matter, but sometimes what appears to be of minimal importance can trigger a major reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, I am especially concerned with one family of chemicals—organophosphorous pesticides—commonly used in agriculture, and now infamous for their use in the Gulf war, but it would be inappropriate to deal with that this morning. I am especially interested to know—I hope that the Minister can give us a progress report—whether the attempt to introduce specific, precise conditions for the sale, supply, storage and use of those pesticides is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
proving sufficiently effective. There is widespread concern in the sheep farming sector that scab is on the increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister has been reviewing that matter, and she might like to refer to it. If we are experiencing an increase in that extremely damaging condition and if the certification system is neither appropriately controlling the sale and supply of such products nor increasing the care with which they are used on the farm, the problem is obviously likely to become much worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party group on organophosphorus pesticides, which I chair, has had several useful meetings with the Minister and her predecessors. I hope that she would acknowledge that those meetings have been positive and constructive. We are looking forward to having another meeting in the near future. Our offices have been in weekly contact during the past few weeks. I would not expect her to deal with the entire subject this morning, but I would expect her to give an undertaking that matters to do with OPs are being considered seriously and urgently and that the meeting with the Minister and her colleagues at the Department of Health will take place in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall objective in introducing both sets of regulations is entirely worth while and welcome. We all want to clarify and tidy up the regulations, but there are important public concerns that the Minister has not yet fully addressed. I hope that she will give us further reassurance in her reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Wardle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bexhill and Battle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee for long, but I received a letter from my Whip, advising me that it was a privilege to serve on this Committee—and how right he was. I thought that the only way to show that I appreciate that privilege was to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a couple of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In schedule 3 of both sets of regulations, paragraph 7(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person in the course of a commercial service shall use a prescribed plant protection approved for agricultural use unless".</p></blockquote>
A number of conditions are then set out, lurking at the bottom of which, in paragraph 7(1)(c)(vi), there is a get-out clause, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"'other' (as may be defined by the Ministers)."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether it is designed as a get-out clause—I imagine it is. Will my hon. Friend tell me whether the definition "by the Ministers" will be before or after the fact? Will she have to amend the regulations and write in what the "other" circumstances are, or is it simply a condition that she can lay on someone who has innocently done something but who finds out afterwards, because of the ministerial definition, that he has breached the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question refers to paragraph 8 of schedule 3. I do not know whether it is ageism on the part of the European Commission, but paragraph 8 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person who was born later than 31 December 1964 shall use a prescribed plant protection".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
What is magical about the age of 32 that such responsibility applies after that date but not before?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.56 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members who have contributed to the debate and for the consensus that we seem to have. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) mentioned micro-organisms. He will be aware that there are separate sets of strictly controlled regulations on the release of micro-organisms into the atmosphere, and I assure him that such controls cover his concerns. I also assure him that the existing regulations apply equally to non-native organisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the review of pesticides, and we are all aware that we have to monitor those carefully, especially in terms of the transition from United Kingdom to European regulations. We do not just want to say that it will be some time before we get round to considering individual products, because if problems crop up in the meantime, we have the normal statutory requirement to take action. It would be unfair to tell the Committee that the review can be done in a hurry, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall continue to be vigilant as we make the transition through to European regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application of the regulations has been accepted by the Committee and the changes to them are practical, while ensuring the safety of the public and the environment. The relationship between the basic conditions in the regulations and the changes to them will ensure that we move forward with great care and diligence. The hon. Gentleman mentioned several products such as wood preservative, and we are conscious that there are chemicals in that product that can affect bats, for example. We consider such matters when the usual products that people tend not to focus on so much are reviewed by the committee that advises Ministers. I assure the hon. Gentleman that such consideration will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe made some kind remarks about the work that my Department has been doing to protect birds of prey and other wildlife. We are concerned about such wildlife and have put resources into protecting it. The hon. Gentleman referred to out-of-date chemicals and pesticides that may have been sitting around for a long time. The Health and Safety Executive is extremely vigilant in its inspections of farms and it uses the existing regulations to ensure that if farmers are keeping out-of-date pesticides or ones that no longer have authorisation, which happens sometimes if they have been kept for a long time, the chemicals are removed and disposed of. Time limits are set for the farmer to take the necessary action to ensure that such a process takes place. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now be assured that the Health and Safety Exectutive regards such inspection procedures as a normal part of its visits to farms.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) referred to OP dips and the effects of organophosphates. I assure him that we shall have a meeting soon. It might be a nice gesture to try to arrange it for Valentine's day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a Friday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, we shall have to make it another day. I have valued the all-party meetings on such matters at the Ministry in which the hon. Gentlemen has participated. My office is in touch with his office and we hope to be able to set a date for a meeting in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentlemen said that the Veterinary Products Committee concluded its review of OP dips earlier in the year, and I assure him that it will not be long before the Government responds to it. We have considered it carefully, together with other Departments that are involved in such controls, and a formal response to the recommendations will be made shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given my interest in the subject, the hon. Gentlemen will know that I shall do all that I can to ensure that we protect people who, through their normal day-to-day work, have to use the chemicals that, as he will know, are authorised legitimately on the market. We are not in any way cavalier about the way in which they must be applied on the farm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Organophosphates are of great concern and the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) referred to some of the problems with them. When talking to farmers generally, some expressed the worry that organophosphates may be banned, particularly in sheep dip, resulting in some farmers storing them. If organophosphates are to be restricted under the regulations, I think that I am right in saying that their use will be illegal. If there is to be change, will the Minister ensure that it is made clear to farmers that it will be illegal to store such chemicals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can inform the Committee that, to date, I have not received any advice to the effect that organophosphates should be banned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about if that happens in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should it happen in future, we shall consider carefully, as we have with other products, where the product is, where it is stored and who has it. It would not be only farmers who would store it, but others in the chain. Should we receive such advice and should it be put into legislation, I hope that we shall be diligent in the way in which we removed such products, whether they be OPs or others, from the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek assurance from the Minister. As the products are understood to be extremely damaging in certain circumstances to the health of individuals, the control over their sale, store and use is presently extremely strict. I would not want it felt from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
recent exchange that there is a free-and-easy situation at present, which might be restricted in future. It is much restricted at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister and her colleagues decided to take a step further, I accept that that would introduce a new situation. Everyone knows that such products are potentially damaging. That is why I want to know whether it is her view and that of the Ministry that the current certification scheme, which is precise for such products given the damage that they can do to individuals, is sufficient to the task. However, the Minister may not be in a position to give me such an assurance now, and may have to do so at the meeting to which she has referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to make a statement about that at present. As I said, the Government have been considering the advice that we have received. We are extremely anxious to ensure that, when we receive advice from our advisory committees, it will be of benefit to those who must use such products on a daily basis if it were put into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and I have had several conversations on that subject and I share his concern about existing legislation on certification and the purchase of OP dips. I do not want to make a statement in Committee—it would not be appropriate—but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are considering the scope of that existing provision and how it can be improved upon. I shall say no more today, because it will be the subject of a formal statement in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Cornwall and others mentioned the effect that those physical means of destroying pests may have on creatures such as cockroaches, insects and even mice that come into contact with them. Although those physical means of destroying pests have been deregulated, I appreciate that they may affect human health, having a detrimental effect because of allergies. Certainly, the Department of Health will pay particular attention to that. However, the regulations deal specifically with chemicals. I cannot really say that the use of adjuvants in flypapers, which cause the insect to stick to the paper, is the same as using a spray to remove insects and pests. They have been taken out of the scope of the regulations, but the key chemical is covered in terms of human safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Cornwall also asked about the long-term cocktail effect of such chemicals. I share his concern. The hon. Gentleman will know that research into that is being undertaken. I assure him that we take the matter seriously, and our advisory committee certainly considers the subject. With new chemicals, new combinations of chemicals and new technology, we need to be extremely alert. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the independent committees that advise Government are also aware of that. We must keep up to date with new developments and the compounding of various chemicals. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that we are alert to that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that those matters are dealt with by advisory committees. Is money set aside to study that question, which is of major public concern? If we were to take a straw poll about the effect of pesticides on the body, everyone would say that they had no control over their intake and would presume that the authorities were working on the problem. Can the Minister give us more information about what is happening?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to write to the hon. Gentleman with the figures; but, yes, there is a budget and we do have a scheme for measuring pesticide residues, particularly in food products. That is being done on the Ministry budget, and the outcome of that on-going monitoring is available and in the public domain. I am sure that a paper giving the latest figures has been deposited in the Library, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the budget and give a little more detail about the Department's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although pesticides are authorised, it is important to monitor food products and test for residue levels; there are various safety thresholds, depending on what sort of chemical is involved. It is our responsibility to check whether there is a trend in pesticide residues found in the food chain, or whether individual food products are in any way hazardous to human health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that and I am sure that lots of work is going on, but I am talking about measured residues in food products. Who is measuring those residues and are they being measured in conjunction with metal-working fluids used by engineers or applications for repelling insects—those two items are mentioned in the exclusion list? The list also includes pesticides
	<br><blockquote><p>"used in paint for the sole purpose of preserving the paint".</p></blockquote>
It is the interaction of the various pesticides that worries me, not any one in isolation. Is anyone working on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may wish to know that we are talking about 450 active ingredients and 4,000 products, so it would be difficult for me to give him a precise answer this morning on exactly what work is being done across that range of products. I shall write to him and do my best to give more detailed information; it may be of interest to other hon. Members if I also place that information in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Minister, but this is a matter of concern. I am open about the fact that last year I picked up a tumour; it was benign and had little effect, but I have often wondered how it happened. It might well have had its source in what we are talking about—in the interaction of various things, such as the adhesive paste I used in wallpapering while eating a product that contained a residue. I am speaking not just for myself but for the many other people who have been affected by benign tumours over the years. I am not altogether convinced that such interaction is being taken on board by the scientific authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can add to my promise to write to the hon. Gentleman and tell him that we have an ongoing reporting system—there is a national database—or adverse human reactions to a whole range of chemicals. On his personal account, I do not know whether the diagnosis related to a fungicide in a wallpaper paste and it would be optimistic for me to say that we could clearly identify the cause in collating the data. We can, however, identify trends or the development of patterns in adverse human reactions to chemicals, which can be helpful in medical research. That data can be a valuable resource and we spend much time in and attach much importance to ensuring that people and doctors know that there is a mechanism for reporting adverse reactions. When I write to the hon. Gentleman, I shall include details of how that works. The mechanism is available directly to the general public, not just to professionals, and it is important that it remains that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is often raised in my postbag, often via hon. Members. Members of the public believe that they can identify why a reaction has been triggered by a chemical that they have used, but the professional or general practitioner whom they have consulted does not agree. It is not for me as a Minister to judge whether they are right medically, but we all know that there have been times when the medical profession has not been quick to recognise what is in front of it. It is essential that the resource continues to be made available to members of the public, so that we can consider their views alongside those of the medical profession. The hon. Gentleman asks me a question that covers a huge range of individual chemicals and I am sorry that I cannot give more details now, but I shall put the information into the public domain in the Library, as I am sure that it will be of interest to people other than the hon. Gentleman, who has quite properly raised the matter this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Wardle) is on the Committee and has found time to join us this morning to raise two pertinent points—I hope that I can answer his questions. The use of the term "other" in schedule 3 paragraph 7(1)(c)(xi) is a catch-all, and my hon. Friend is right in his interpretation of it. I can assure him that it would not be necessary for Ministers to introduce new regulations to implement that, but we would act if we thought that there was a need when a new situation arose. The regulations as drafted would allow us to implement the measure without any additional legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned advertising. If changes were made following consultation, we would ensure that full information is given to all those who need to know. When information needs to be given out, we publish it in the relevant professional journals and do our best to ensure that the message cascades down to everyone who needs to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be honest and tell my hon. Friend that I do now know the answer to that. I am not supposed to say this, but a voice behind me is saying, "We are working on this." It would be wrong to guess and I shall have to write to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1986, we have had a framework for effective statutory control of the marketing and use of pesticides in the United Kingdom. The draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations 1997 will iron out minor ambiguities and difficulties. The draft Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations 1997 will ensure that the transition from one regime to another can be managed smoothly and effectively. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is possible and will happen. The net result will be that the burdens on industry and enforcement bodies will be minimised, while maintaining in full the

comprehensive reassurance provided by the regulatory system that pesticides used in this country are safe to people and the environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
