	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 68, in page 11, line 33, leave out "£135" and insert "£133".</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment reduces vehicle excise duty from the Government's proposed amount of £135 to £133. In settling on that lower figure we took the retail prices index from November 1993 to November 1994, which stood at 2.6 per cent., and felt that that was the maximum reasonable increase in vehicle excise duty on cars. Bearing in mind the comments of the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins) this morning and his reluctance to vote for tax increases because of his manifesto commitments, I hope that we can persuade him to vote with us this afternoon—that is if that commitment was worth the paper it was written on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 16 March 1993 vehicle excise duty was £110. On 17 March 1993 it was increased to £125. On 1 December 1993 it was increased to £130, and on 30 November 1994 the Chancellor proposed to increase it to £135. In just over 18 months vehicle excise duty has thus been increased by 22.7 per cent. Over the same period, the RPI has risen by only 4.3 per cent. If vehicle excise duty had been uprated by inflation only, its current rate would be £115.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as increasing vehicle excise duty, the Government have pursued a policy of increasing the duty on petrol. The duty on a litre of leaded petrol has risen by 9.8p in the three Budgets since 1993. If petrol duty had been increased and uprated solely by inflation, it would have risen by only 2p over that same period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These increases represent the Government's one-club response to the Rio environmental targets to which they signed up. The Government constantly justify those increases in terms of that commitment, but to many people, particularly those in rural areas, they represent a severe blow to their living standards. In the absence of a decent public transport system in rural areas, it is hardly surprising that people are forced to rely on their cars and
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
so have to absorb the additional charges. If the Government were really serious about meeting environmental targets and using vehicle excise duty as a mechanism for that, they should perhaps consider varying vehicle excise duty according to the size of a car's engine. There is a strong argument that that would be fairer, as the poorest car owners will typically own smaller cars. They would then be more likely to be persuaded to pursue other issues relating to car pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increases in petrol duty and vehicle excise duty are another example of the Government's hidden tax increases; they are part of a policy of increasing indirect taxes. For instance, since 1979 there has been a massive increase in the percentage of tax in the price of petrol. In 1979, it was about 45 per cent. of the retail price of a gallon of petrol; by January 1995, it was 75 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through our amendments, we hope to open up debate and to persuade the Government that they must consider pursuing policies that are environmentally friendly and designed not simply to increase Government revenue but to tackle the real environmental issues. Indeed, a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister's own advisers publicly challenged him and the Government to introduce green taxes. They made radical proposals about how to shift the emphasis in our taxation system, to become more environmentally friendly while providing the necessary revenue. I freely admit that we, too, do not have the answer to this series of questions. The report was challenging and far reaching. If it were decided to take such action, there would be a long and sometimes difficult process of transition. But road tax is a good starting point. We are attempting today to nudge—nicely—the Government in the direction of finally tackling the relationship between vehicle excise duty, duty on petrol and the use of the car instead of car ownership, as the beginning of recognising that we need radically to shift our taxes if we are all to put into practice what we so often repeat and some people preach. We need a taxation system that protects our environment as well as our finances and Treasury income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge members of the Committee to vote for the amendments as a sign of good faith from this Finance Bill Committee that all of us, regardless of political party, intend to begin that difficult but vital transition from our present taxation system to a more environmentally friendly system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would limit the increase in vehicle excise duty for cars, taxis and trailers. I should perhaps take the collective memory of the Committee a little further back than the point at which the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years it has been the practice to increase VED in multiples of £10 or £5. We have rounded the increase up to £5, although the Government's successful counter-inflation policy, if used as a strict criterion, would have delivered a smaller poundage increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, the Government have restrained the rate of VED to below the rate of inflation. Between 1985 and 1992—a period of seven years—there was no increase in VED. Since then it has increased either by £10 or £5 a year, and it is a £5 increase that we are proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned the Rio environmental convention, suggesting that we had a one-club approach
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
to meeting our targets. I should point out that we were, as I recall, the first country to publish a comprehensive plan to meet the Rio targets. There is a tendency elsewhere in the world to sign up to things without having any idea of how to deliver. That is a sort of declaratory approach to the environment. We followed up our pledge to stabilise CO
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions with a comprehensive plan. We are not relying on the so-called one-club approach of simply increasing fuel or VED rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport is only one sector involving carbon dioxide and other emissions. Although not the largest sector, transport emissions are increasing fastest. It is important that we find a way of limiting that, and a powerful incentive is to increase taxation. Fuel taxation is particularly effective because it encourages people to drive less, to seek other modes of transport and to drive more economically. It also influences people's choice of vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
VED taxation also has a part to play. Some who wish us to abolish VED altogether and put the whole burden on fuel overlook the essential job of maintaining a comprehensive record of vehicle ownerhip. Even if VED were not used to raise tax, we should need to find a way to keep that record up to date, not only to combat car crime but because the record is important to recalling vehicles for safety checks and is a cheap, easy way to check that MOT certificates and insurance certificates are valid. The VED system is an important part of our system of motoring taxation and it is right that we should increase it from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That answers the hon. Lady's points, but if other hon. Members wish to contribute to debate I shall answer at the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To continue the point about the appropriateness of VED, my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South suggested engine capacity for taxation, wondering whether there might be benefits in kind, in that the tax one pays could depend on engine size. Would it be useful to consider capacities in the context of VED in future? That would be a small environmental contribution, but a positive one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall that we debated a Liberal Democrat amendment to that effect on the Floor of the House. The disadvantages of reducing VED rates for smaller engines are that it introduces an administrative complexity to the tax; and a distortion, in that manufacturers might be induced to reduce very slightly the cubic capacity of the engines in their cars in order to qualify them for the lower tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cars with smaller engines do not necessarily cause less pollution than those with larger ones. Old, small cars are among the worst polluters on the roads, whereas a modern car with a catalytic converter, even it if has a larger cubic capacity, can be more environmentally benign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat amendment was a blunt instrument with which to achieve the same result as increasing the price of fuel, which encourages the motorist to economise in various ways, not only by buying smaller cars but by driving them more slowly and using them rather less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>IMPORTED WORKS OF ART, ANTIQUES, ETC</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Paymaster General a series of questions about clause 17. The clause provides for some highly complex changes in VAT law. Much depends on statutory instruments that will be brought before the House after the Bill has been enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will clause 17 repeal article 19 of the Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1992? I presume that it will, but it is not clear. Will reduced VAT apply to all importations that are currently relieved from VAT on importation under article 9? Why does it appear that the reduced rate does not already apply to items which are abroad and have been exported more than once? I should have said that the clause deals with works of art, and there has been some controversy—I put it no more strongly than that—about the rate of VAT that needs to be levied according to requirements and directives. The Government have successfully negotiated reduced rates, but we still require some clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that works of art will be subject to the reduced rate only on the first time that they are imported. The international market centres on London and works of art come and go frequently. Are we mistaken in our assumption, or is that the case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is VAT charged on items that are temporarily sent abroad? A work of art may be part of a collection that is out of the country for display, or it may be sent out of the country for valuation. I know, Mr. Winterton, that you are very familiar with this complex subject and that you are aware of the severe problems that exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of a work of art appears to be different in the Bill from that in the Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1992. Will the Minister explain why? It appears that the current definition is narrower than the article 2 definition in a number of respects. For example, it is unclear what is a collection as opposed to a collector's piece. Some clarification would assist those of us who are trying to understand a subject that will continue to come before Parliament for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of unique or limited edition ceramics and engraved glassware. I should like confirmation from the Minister that those works will be accepted for the purposes of VAT legislation under proposed subsections (6)(a) or (6)(c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final two points are due to my interest in the subject. How much tax will be raised by the measures? The Paymaster General's predecessor was reluctant to give us that information because of negotiations at that time, when we were trying to sort out variations from directive 6. What steps are the Government taking to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
monitor the tax and its impact on the London art market, because there is still pressure to harmonise? We need that information to enable us to proceed to the inevitable negotiations that we shall face in 1997, 1998 or 1999. Will there be a report of the impact on the market of those regimes and will that report be available to hon. Members, many of whom have expressed interest and concern about the possible impact of the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the fact that my questions are complicated. For hon. Members who have not, as some of us have, had to study these clauses with care, I am sure that when the Minister replies or the full information is available, all will become clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add to the Paymaster General's burden by asking some related questions, because I have a significant constituency interest? In my constituency we are proud of the fact that we have, we think, the finest cut-glass crystal in the world. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South made some points about the Bill which I should like to pick up on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the distinction between a collection and collectors' pieces. When one is referring to collections of glass, that is a significant distinction in the sense that some collectors' pieces may not in themselves be unique or valuable but the overall collection of glass is valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an assurance from the Minister that, under proposed subsection (5)(d), crystal glass will be included under the definition of being of mineralogical interest, since it is not clear that glass crystal falls within that definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a related point, my hon. Friend asked whether ceramics and engraved glassware would fall within proposed subsections (6)(a) or (6)(c). The provision should cover glassware, not simply engraved glassware. Some fine pieces of collectable glassware are not engraved. New subsection (6)(c) refers to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"original sculptures and statuary, in any material."</p></blockquote>
That could include glass crystal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the Paymaster General's views on the definition of originality. The crystal glass industry produces a volume of goods, often in limited editions, which attains a significant rarity value. However, each item will not necessarily be unique.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend that Members visit Broadfield House museum in my constituency—it is a fine museum. I should not like the museum or the crystal glass industry to be disadvantaged. If the museum wishes to import collections from abroad, or when donors wish to buy collections from abroad to add to the museum, they should not be at a disadvantage. I would welcome assurances from the Minister. Perhaps he will be prepared to consider tabling an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 17 June 1992, the right hon. Member for Northavon (Sir J. Cope), the then Paymaster General, said in response to a parliamentary question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In principle the draft seventh VAT directive … would apply to donated second-hand goods being sold for charitable purposes from 1993."</p></blockquote>
Clauses 17 and 19 implement the European Union seventh directive on second-hand goods by taxing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
margin between the purchase and selling prices. However, the right hon. Member for Northavon continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But these are zero-rated in the United Kingdom and our zero rates are already fully safeguarded until at least 1997 under the sixth VAT directive. Decisions on tax matters within the EC require unanimity and there is no question of the United Kingdom being forced to accept unwelcome proposals to end zero-rating after that.".—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 17 June 1992; Vol. 209, 
	<i>c.</i> 540.]</p></blockquote>
That statement was confirmed by the right hon. Member for Northavon on 2 December 1992, when he told European Standing Committee B:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall protect our charities' interests."—
	<i>[Official Report, European Standing Commitee B, 2</i> December 1992; 
	<i>c.</i> 10.]</p></blockquote>
Several charities are worried about the overall effect of the proposal. I hope that the Paymaster General will reassure me about its impact. Is it still the Government's policy to protect charitable interests? An annex attached to the deliberations on the seventh directive shows clearly that some anxiety existed when the directive was passed. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council and the Commission state that, for the purposes of applying this Directive, they will examine with an open mind the problem of the taxable amount for supplies of goods carried out under the conditions set out in B, by charitable organizations whose operations are exempt in accordance with Article 13(A)(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I suggest that the hon. Gentleman speaks a little slower and a little louder? Some of what he is saying—indeed all of what he says—needs to be heard by the Committee and those who are charged with providing an accurate record of our proceedings: 
	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, Mr. Winterton,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… where the goods supplied have been made available to them free of charge and provided that these provisions are not liable to entail distortions of competition."</p></blockquote>
The document continues with various caveats and assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some charitable organisations feel that the impact of adding VAT could be expensive. Oxfam has suggested that it might lose more than £5 million a year. Some charities fear that the overall impact on the charitable sector could be in excess of £12 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charities regard the issue as a serious one. They need to know how clauses 17 and 19 will impact upon them. We need clear assurances from the Minister that charities will not be affected by the measure and that the expressions of Government policy made by the previous Paymaster General continue to be Government policy. We need to know that the Government will protect charities' interests and that charities such as Oxfam will not, as a result of clauses 17 and 19, have to pay £5 million extra a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. In my copy of the Bill the clause relates to imported works of art and antiques. I am not entirely sure how that relates to much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying about charities. I am not sure that Oxfam, for example, is well known for its imports, exports or purchases of works of art. Will the hon. Gentleman draw to the Committee's attention precisely the relevance of his remarks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It may be useful if, by way of introduction, I point out that such matters have been extensively discussed before in European Standing Committee. Some members of the Committee have attended those debates, which are necessarily complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seventh VAT directive, which the clauses implement in UK legislation, is—as is the case with much VAT legislation—technical, and has been generally welcomed by businesses. It is a deregulatory measure in most respects and has been the subject of extensive consultation and discussion at industry and trade level. That is certainly true of the matter under debate in the clause, which relates to the fine art market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My officials and those at Customs and Excise have had frequent meetings and correspondence with representatives of the fine art market, as did my predecessor. The settlement that was reached by my right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon my predecessor, was a success. The hon. Lady the Member for Bristol, South was generous enough to describe it as a successful negotiation. It preserves the position of the valuable United Kingdom art market. We did not want imported art to be subjected to the same level of taxation as imported art elsewhere in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same degree of consultation has continued right up until now, in that the clauses under discussion were published for consultation by trade bodies ahead of publication of the Finance Bill. They have not submitted their criticisms of the clauses that we are debating this afternoon, although they are still in discussion with officials about the administrative provisions and details necessary to make the new arrangements work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is estimated that taxation on imports of works of art will raise £4.6 million in 1995–96. That answers one of the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo). It is estimated that £5.9 million will be raised in 1996–97. The hon. Lady asked why VAT was charged on items temporarily sent abroad. I presume that she was asking why VAT is charged on the re-importation of goods that have temporarily been sent abroad, such as for valuation purposes. In fact, several schemes of relief are available to industry in relation to goods temporarily sent abroad. Those schemes are unaffected by the seventh directive and will continue. Their purpose is to assist traders and individuals who send goods abroad temporarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South asked whether the reduced rate would apply only to works of art when first imported. I can confirm that new subsection (5)(b)
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
restricts the reduced rate to first importation but that is no different from the relief that it replaces: the relief from import VAT which currently prevails. We are simply substituting another arrangement for an existing one, which is similar in that respect. The hon. Lady also asked whether the clause would repeal article 9 of the Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1992, and I can confirm that it will. Article 9 will be repealed, and its provisions re-enacted in clause 17 for the reduced rate of VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) asked whether glass crystal came within the definition in new subsection (5)(c). I must confess that I am no expert on glassware, but I can confirm that the glass crystal in question would be covered if it was more than 100 years old and, if so, it would qualify for the reduced rate under subsection (5)(c). I hope that the collection with which he is familiar qualifies in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question raised by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien), I must confess to joining you, Mr. Winterton, in being somewhat confused about the connection with charities. I am happy to give what assurances I can—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I again draw to the attention of the Minister the question of the London art market? When the EC Finance Ministers agreed on 14 February 1994 to the directive and its implementation, as part of the agreement resulting from those excellent negotiations the Commission was committed to examining the impact of the seventh directive on the competitiveness of the Community art market. It is equally important that we monitor or conduct a review of the impact of the arrangements that we are about to agree on the London art
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
market. That review will provide information useful in the negotiations for which we shall return to the Commission in, I believe, December 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to tell us that the information is to be made available in some way—perhaps in the House of Commons Library—so that hon. Members who are especially interested in this topic will be able to make submissions to the Government in advance of those negotiations in 1998. We cannot go back and argue for a continuing reduction or another deal on reduction if we are unable clearly to demonstrate that there is a difficulty for the London market. I do not think the Minister answered when I raised the point earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that to assist the trade further we have delayed implementation of this part of the seventh directive. At the end of last year it became clear that the art and auction trade was experiencing genuine difficulties in changing its accounting systems in time for full implementation on the target date of 1 January. That was not the trade's fault; nor was it ours. It was a combination of circumstances to which a contributory factor was the EC Commission's inability to fulfil an undertaking, which it had made when the directive was adopted, to extend the coverage of temporary import relief in time for 1 January. That extension of temporary import relief was an essential component of making a practical success of the directive as regards importation of works of art.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress the main point, which is that the fact that we negotiated a 2.5 per cent. effective rate of import VAT was a testament to the seriousness with which my predecessor took representations made to him by those who work in both the London and the United Kingdom art market. We have a comparative advantage in the art sector; it is a national strength and one that we want to retain. We obtained an agreement for the arrangement to run at least until 1999. The Commission may be concerned about the overall competitive position of the European Union art market, but my concern is the British art market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only am I in close touch with those who work in that market, but I and my successor—if there is one by then—will undoubtedly be receiving representations about how the tax works out in practice. Obviously, it is impossible for me to predict how it will work now. I can only give the assurance that, before 1999, we shall examine carefully how the tax works in practice and whether the assurances that I am giving about the comparative advantage for the United Kingdom that we are trying to retain are in fact fulfilled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 14, line 37, leave out "antiques" and insert
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"any antique more than 100 years old".</p></blockquote>
It will also be appropriate to discuss the clause's impact on charities. It is difficult for all members of the Committee to deal with complex provisions with only scant explanations in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 19 will introduce new section 50A into the Value Added Tax Act 1994. It sets out only the main parameters for margin schemes, and makes it clear that details will be filled in by statutory instruments. We shall not know the contents of statutory instruments until the clause has been agreed to, which makes it difficult for Labour Members—and I am sure, for Ministers as well—to give a cogent explanation of what will be involved. Will the Paymaster General explain why that is the case? Do the Government have something to hide? Why cannot they demonstrate clearly their taxation intentions in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schemes can apply to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"works of art, antiques or collectors' items … supplies of motor vehicles".</p></blockquote>
It can also apply to
	<br><blockquote><p>"supplies of second-hand goods".</p></blockquote>
I was interested to read in press reports over the past year that works of art are considered to be second-hand goods. Until I sat on this Committee, I had a rather narrow understanding of what counted as second-hand goods. I shall look more closely in charitable shops in case there are works of art there. The definition is strange, and will cause some difficulties, which we shall discuss later. There is not a clear definition of what is meant by "second-hand goods".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When clause 19 was compared with clause 17, it was noticed that antiques in clause 17 are qualified with the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"more than one hundred years old"</p></blockquote>
but that that clarification was not included in clause 19. I do not know what I should count as an antique, although on late-night sittings many Members feel antique, and certainly look it. However, the legislation should be consistent. There is no explanation for the discrepancy. The amendment would sort it out and make the definition of an antique consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it is common practice each year in the Committee considering the Finance Bill, but it is, to put it politely, extremely unsatisfactory for the Committee to be asked to give powers for taxation without knowing the basis on which such taxation will operate. To be required to keep an eagle eye on statutory instruments and how they might be dealt with in the House is not the way for open government and a clear accountable taxation system to proceed. I hope that Ministers will not use that mechanism, in the period that they have left in Government before a general election, to conceal their true taxation intentions by making enabling clauses and then sneaking through statutory instruments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

able to catch your eye subsequently on the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I respectfully suggest to the hon. Member for Bristol, South that she may have misunderstood the difference between clause 17 and clause 19? Clause 17 deals with the importation of items such as antiques and works of art, whereas clause 19 deals with a margin scheme, which includes items such as second-hand goods. I respectfully put it to her that since second-hand goods are already included, it is not necessary to restrict the description of antiques—which may well also be secondhand goods if they are less than 100 years old—to that provided in clause 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have carefully examined the amendment. It is not acceptable, though I should explain why, because it is fair to draw attention to apparent differences in wording or descriptions in two parts of the same Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) quite rightly said, clauses 17 and 19 serve different purposes. Clause 17 allows works of art, collectors' pieces and so on, which have in the past been relieved of VAT at importation, to be taxed at an effective rate of 2½ per cent. The definitions used in clause 17 for antiques and other items reflect the existing legal definitions of the relieved goods in question. We are dealing with goods which previously were not taxed and which now come in at 2½ per cent., so those definitions are carried forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 19, on the other hand, is about a margin scheme, which the Committee may wish to debate later. In that context, the word "antiques" is right, because the intention is for antiques to be more fully described later in secondary legislation. The definition in that scheme will be that required by the seventh VAT directive, which refers to objects other than works of art of collectors' items which are more than 100 years old, so that definition comes from a different direction. I think that that adequately explains the difference between the two treatments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General talked about an exception of works of art and collectors' items. As a matter of interest, what is the definition of a collectors' item?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point that will be elaborated on in secondary legislation. It is pointless in primary legislation to define every collectors' item. That is why, for hundreds of years, the procedures of the House have wisely given over to regulations, orders and secondary legislation the provision of detailed descriptions. In that way, new types of collections, new technologies and new tastes are accommodated without the need for primary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should declare an interest as a member of the council of management of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, although that does not give me a personal interest because it is purely an honorary role. However, it does give me an interest in the margin scheme that we are discussing. The PDSA operates several charity shops. Indeed, they are some of its most profitable activities in raising money for a worthwhile cause. Over many years, the PDSA has lobbied on this matter. As the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North reminded us in the debate on clause 17, this matter is of general concern to charities, certainly those that run charity shops. We have been fortunate on various occasions in persuading the Paymaster General to make it clear that the Government will resist a proposal to tax the margin on goods sold by charities in second-hand shops at anything other than a zero rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would confirm that it is still the Government's intention to apply a zero rate to that category of goods. It would be even more helpful and reassuring to those concerned, because it would put the matter beyond peradventure, if he could undertake to table an amendment on Report to include that point in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
Member for Bournemouth, West I too have an interest to declare—a constituency interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud to say that according to a recent survey, Darlington has more charity shops than any other town in the country. Obviously there will be great interest there in the matter that we are considering. Like the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West I think that it would be opportune for the Minister to offer the assurances that his predecessor was able to give the House on several occasions, about the treatment of charity shops. I cannot remember whether my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North mentioned the potential impact on charities of the imposition of VAT, but according to the Charities Tax Report Group the losses could run to more than £12 million a year. That would be a substantial dent in the activities of an important part of the voluntary sector. It might have been useful if the Finance Bill could have reflected the assurances given by the previous Paymaster General on this subject. It would still be useful if the present Paymaster General would give an oral assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Front-Bench colleague alluded to the fact that the provision, which is very important, has been put to the Committee in only the most skeletal form. Other members of the Committee and I have grown accustomed in recent years to primary legislation being drafted in a way that leaves implementation to secondary legislation that cannot be amended. As the Minister knows, the statutory instruments that will implement the clauses will come before the House to be voted for or voted down, but will not be open to amendment. That is a regrettable mess and it leads inevitably to shoddy legislation. My plea is not a party-political point but concerns all of us who are interested in the good drafting of laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finance Bill is very long and I should have thought that a few additional clauses would make it possible to define the powers that Customs will have in relation to the pricing structure. I know that it is too late for the Minister to do anything about that, but I hope that all members of Finance Bill Committees share my plea that wherever possible in future we avoid using secondary rather than primary legislation to frame important powers to be given to the Revenue or Customs authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>c.</i> 10.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister can reassure us today. The possibility that we have been discussing is serious. Some charities are concerned that it could be devastating for them. As I already indicated, Oxfam fears that it might lose as much as £5 million if the proposal is implemented. The charity sector stands at risk for £12 million. I seek assurances from the Minister, and I hope that he will say that he will be protecting our charities. It is Government policy, which the Opposition share. We should be supporting many of our charities that do good work. It would be a tragedy if this, or any other legislation, damaged that aim. I hope that the Paymaster General will give us the assurance that we seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Also, although the Marie Curie Cancer Care does not tend to do its fund raising through shops, I am chairman of its support group for west Lancashire and it has expressed concern. The Children's Society—formerly the Church of England Children's Society—in whose charity shops members of my family have worked, has also expressed concern. I know that it is a widely shared concern so I can only echo points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West and other hon. Members. I am sure that my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I need to point out to the Committee that there is nothing unusual about the use of primary legislation as outlined in the clause. Primary legislation gives enabling powers, which is the customary approach, but there is always a good deal of detail—particularly detailed descriptions and lists—which is left to secondary legislation. There is a description of second-hand goods in the seventh directive and it is intended to bring that into use in our law through secondary legislation. When that is done, it will be shown and exposed to the businesses concerned for them to comment. There is nothing untoward or out or order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of charities, I repeat the assurances given by my predecessor and remind the Committee that, under the sixth VAT directive, the position of charities is specified and protected. For example, charities enjoy zero rating on the sale of donated goods. I have no intention of that being changed. My intention may not be an adequate safeguard, so I shall assert that that cannot be changed except by unanimous agreement by member states. The end of the transitional period under the sixth VAT directive, which specifies the status, will undoubtedly be subject to review by the Commission, but there can be no change without all member states agreeing. We have an effective national veto over the zero rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission has undertaken to consider measures to alleviate the problem thereafter, but, unless we were satisfied that any alternative arrangement delivered the same benefits, we would not agree to that change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that no such statutory instrument shall come into force until it has been approved by resolution of the Commons House of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
The clause deals with a new section of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 and applies to any case in which two or more persons together may make a supply of any interest in, right over or licence to occupy land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The persons concerned, the grantors, are treated as a single person who is distinct from each of the grantors individually and is separately registered for VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grantors are jointly and severally liable for the property and the VAT obligations. Any notice for VAT purposes to the property owner may be served on any grantor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a grantor ceases to be a grantor he or she remains liable for the property for the purposes of VAT in respect of any VAT returns period starting before the change is notified to the Customs. People become liable for an entire period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled an amendment, which was not selected, to deal with the problem. I hope that the Minister will examine the matter again because it seems unfair that people are still liable when they have no interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides for a mechanism to respond to yet another requirement for a statutory instrument, and for a proper assessment of the likely impact of the proposal. There should be a resolution before Parliament on the changes after a report has been made and before we are required to discuss and agree the detail of the statutory instrument. We are attempting to obtain information before we are required to make a decision. That is a reasonable request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: By way of introduction, it would be helpful if I sketched the purpose of the clause. It is designed to clarify the position of co-owners of property who make taxable supplies of that property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present where there are co-owners—they are often trustees—they are registered for VAT purposes as partnerships, but it has been put to the Government that they are not usually partnerships in the legal sense and that many of those involved resent being treated as partners because there may be significant direct tax disadvantages in being so considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are responding to representations and removing that necessary status; instead, they will be registered as a single taxable person without the quasi-legal tag of partnership. That is a responsible way of responding to a legitimate anxiety. I am surprised that the hon. Lady should query it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the substance of the amendment, it is not uncommon for the effective date of a measure to be determined by statutory instrument after the measure is passed by the House. That happened to last year's Finance Bill: A number of measures concerning the variation of penalties and the restriction of set-off of revenue debts were brought into force on a day determined by statutory instrument. Again, that is for the convenience of the tax paying public. There are occasions when businesses or those advising them, or indeed Customs and Excise or the Inland Revenue, need further time to prepare for new legislation. They might have to print some additional stationery and amend a computer system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>

For all those reasons, it is sometimes helpful to bring a Finance Bill measure into effect when those concerned can reasonably accommodate it, as opposed to tying it automatically to the date of Royal Assent. Clause 20(3) does no more than that. The statutory instrument is limited to specifying the effective date of a measure. We are debating the substance of the measure. The statutory instrument will simply introduce it on a convenient date. In the light of those remarks, I hope that the hon. Lady will agree that her amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 18, line 25, leave out "or administration order" and insert

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 61.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 21 is intended to extend the exclusion of set-off to VAT credits arising after a business has traded out of insolvency. Those will no longer be set off against any remaining pre-insolvency debt. The clause also provides clarification that the exclusion from set-off during and after insolvency applies only to the setting off of those credits against pre-insolvency debts. This is a measure to help businesses that are trading out of insolvency, which the existing law does not do. Therefore, it should not be resisted by the Committee, but welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a Scottish dimension to this because Scottish insolvencies were fully covered in the existing provision, but, for technical reasons, it was not possible fully to include the reworded Scottish provisions in the published clause. This is one of the effects of having a separate legal system in Scotland—a fact of which I heartily approve, but it does mean that, from time to time, separate provisions or amendments have to be made to cater for a separate legal system. I encourage the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 19, line 29, leave out from "day" to end and insert "30th November 1994".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple amendment, I hope. As the Paymaster General said, the clause is to assist in insolvency cases.

	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
The Government amendments ensure that it is extended to Scotland. Our amendment seeks to change the day on which the measures become effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, that assistance in insolvency cases becomes operational on Royal Assent. It seems unreasonable that, unlike other measures in the Bill, it does not become operational on the date of the Budget. Our amendment would provide for that, in the absence of an explanation why it is reasonable to expect the provision to wait for Royal Assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment because it would degenerate into an administrative nightmare if we tried to implement it. The setting off of VAT credits is no longer a quill-pen job, but a highly automated process. Therefore, any attempt to trawl through all insolvency actions from the date specified in the amendment to the date in May when the Bill is expected to receive Royal Assent would involve huge administrative difficulties for Customs and Excise. It would have to examine each case in which there had been an automated VAT credit as specified in the clause. It would then have to identify and recalculate what should be the set-off as Parliament intends when the Bill finally becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I urge that we adhere to what must surely be a more normal and regular process—that is, to implement the clause when the Act as a whole comes into force. Incidentally, I have had no representations from traders or their representatives about the date, so I do not believe that they regard the provision as seriously wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification from the Paymaster General. As I understand him, his only reason for not accepting the amendment is that it would be administratively difficult. That is not a good enough explanation why the implementation of such a measure must be delayed. Will the Paymaster General confirm that he asks for the amendment to be rejected simply because it is inconvenient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be no delay in implementing the provision. It will be implemented when Parliament decides to bring .the Act into force. There is no question of delay, beyond what Parliament intends to do with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that if the matter were a serious problem for traders, and if they wished us to backdate the provision to last year, I believe that my Department would have heard about it by now, and it has not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to comment on the Paymaster General's remark that he had received no representations on the matter. I have received a representation from the Institute of Taxation. Its submission states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We submit that, if the purpose is to extend the measures introduced in the Finance Act 1994 relating to insolvent traders, the Clause should have effect in relation to amounts becoming due from the Commissioners of Customs and Excise on or after Budget Day and not the day on which Royal Assent is granted."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I said that I had received no representations from traders, I was accurate. Those affected by the clause—in other words, traders and their representatives, through the Confederation of British Industry or small business groups, have not, as far as I know, contacted us requiring such backdating. Of course, institutes of taxation may have made representations, but I think that my distinction was fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
