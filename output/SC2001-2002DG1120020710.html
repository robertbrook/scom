	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Ms Sally Keeble)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Caribbean Development Bank (Further Payments) Order 2002.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft African Development Fund (Additional Subscriptions) Order 2002.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Griffiths. I am sure that we shall make good progress this afternoon under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Caribbean Development Bank was established in 1969 to contribute to the harmonious economic growth and development of the Commonwealth member countries of the Caribbean and to promote economic co-operation and integration among them. The United Kingdom has been a member of the bank since its inception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the smallest of the regional development banks, the CDB's strength lies in its close contact with its borrower member countries, which enables it to be in tune with their needs and to offer good access to policy makers in the Caribbean. The bank, which provides advice, technical assistance and development finance, has become a key source of expertise on Caribbean development issues and an important financier of small-to-medium scale projects in the region, making disbursements of about $100 million a year. None the less, the CDB is only one of a number of development institutions operating in the Caribbean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development agenda in the region is evolving in response to changes in the global environment and the CDB recognises that it must adapt its role to remain relevant to the needs of its borrowing member countries. To that end, the bank has undertaken a major review of its purpose. A new mission statement now gives greater emphasis to the reduction of poverty in the region through social and economic development, and the bank's strategic plan for the five-year period 2000–04 focuses on promoting economic growth, good governance, environmental issues and the closer economic integration of Caribbean countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is working closely with the bank to advance that agenda. Last February, the Secretary of State for International Development approved publication of the Department's institutional strategy paper for the CDB. Copies have been placed in the Library and should also be available this afternoon, should Members wish to examine the document. It sets out the UK's objectives in working with the bank for the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The CDB is structured along similar lines to the World Bank, with two main lending windows. Ordinary capital resources are lent at the market rate of interest and the special development fund lends, on highly concessional terms, to the poorest member countries in the region. Although the bank's members are eligible for SDF borrowing, a differential interest rate and brace period ensures that the poor members benefit most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDF is primarily donor-funded and is usually replenished every three years. Negotiations on the fifth replenishment were concluded in December 2001. Those negotiations provide an important opportunity for donors to set both the priorities and the policy and operational agenda for fund activities for the next three years. Those are set out in the contributors' report, which contains various actions and targets against which progress on the implementation of this replenishment will be monitored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Baron 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's remarks about trying to ensure that money is given and reaches the poor, as is the bank's brief. However, what concrete assurances have the Government obtained from the two organisations in question that they will not fudge their responsibilities like the European Union, whose overseas aid package is somewhat fudged, in pursuing political objectives at the expense of relieving poverty across the globe? I ask because we are singularly failing to get such assurances from the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These funds operate rather differently from those of the EU, and they are more limited in their scope. I have spoken only about the Caribbean order, not the African one. Concerns have been expressed about the latter, which I shall deal with later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will see from both contributors' reports that a lot of attention has been paid to greater scrutiny of the way in which the loans are provided, which ensures better monitoring measures, including mid-term reviews and annual board meetings. There will also be a tightening up of a range of governance issues to ensure that the projects are carefully scrutinised before the loans are provided and that the progress of the projects is monitored to ensure that the money is properly spent. Considerable steps have been taken—they have been closely debated by the donors—which are set out in the background discussion papers that led to the reports coming forward for replenishment. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her generosity in giving way. If, for whatever reason, it is thought that those organisations have not achieved their objectives at any stage during the process, are mechanisms in place whereby the Government can review funding or instigate penalties of some description to ensure that the money reaches the poor and that it is not directed towards political objectives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's concern; we must be sure that loans intended to benefit the poor succeed in doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The banks and funds involved are not providing grants but making loans to fund specific projects. It seems to me that the two issues need to be considered. We must ensure that the right schemes are funded and that the loans are provided for the right ends. A number of criteria have been drawn up on what should be funded. That question will be addressed also through the board meetings, and we have the opportunity to intervene at that point. The monitoring arrangements have been tightened up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago, specific concerns were expressed about the African Development Fund; that, too, involves board members, so those loans are monitored. There has also been quite a lot of discussion about the arrears; when we discuss the African order, hon. Members may wish to return to that subject, although those issues have been considered. However, the fund is not a grant-giving organisation; it loans money for particular projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. It is good to see you in the Chair, Mr. Griffiths; I am normally accosted by you in the Lobby to sign the latest early-day motion on Sierra Leone, and it is good to see you in another context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm what the repayment record has been for the past 12 months for those two banks? How are they performing in getting repayment of those loans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not yet come to the concerns expressed about the African fund, but there are substantial arrears, particularly in relation to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Arrangements have been made, particularly with the Americans, to pay off some of those arrears. It is probably only the Congo that has such extensive arrears, but hon. Members will recognise that country's particular difficulties. I shall return to that question later. I can dig out the figures and give the hon. Gentleman a list of the arrears, although in the case of the Congo they are very high indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Copies of the contributors' reports are being placed in the Library, and hon. Members will see that many of the issues on priorities for the loans and monitoring arrangements are included in the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main United Kingdom objectives for the SDF-V negotiations—the replenishment negotiations—were achieved. They included: a greater focus of resources on the reduction of poverty, vulnerability and inequality in the Caribbean; the introduction of a performance-based system for the allocation of SDF resources; a commitment to closer donor co-operation through the development of strategic partnerships between the Caribbean Development Bank and other development institutions in the region; a clear linkage between the bank's country strategy papers and the poverty reduction strategies of its borrowing member countries; a commitment to strengthen the bank's monitoring and evaluation capacity; and the development of a more poverty-focused impact assessment system to measure progress towards achievement of the international development targets in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Donors, borrowers and non-borrowers have made pledges to SDF-V that will total $125 million, of which the UK and Canada have each pledged $25.2 million, or £17.4 million. That was a good outcome for the fund, in view of the loss of several European contributors, especially France, Germany and the Netherlands. There was also a reduced Italian contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite domestic difficulties, borrowers increased their pledges to the fund by 30 per cent. The fund is still $32 million short of the target, mainly because expected contributions from other donors have yet to materialise. Subject to parliamentary approval, the UK contribution of $25.2 million will be payable over six years, beginning in 2002–03.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The African Development Fund is the concessional lending arm of the African Development Bank. It was created in 1973 with the objective of reducing poverty in regional member countries. The ADF provides about $1 billion a year of development assistance to 39 of the poorest African countries that are not creditworthy for ADB loans. The fund is largely financed by donor contributions. As fund loans are interest-free and have long maturity periods, income is low. Consequently, if the fund is to continue to lend, it needs to be replenished regularly, usually every three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negotiations on the ninth replenishment of the fund started in June 2001, but their conclusion has been delayed because of the impasse on grants and the parallel IDA 13 negotiations, which has implications for ADF-IX. As commitment capacity for the new fund lending has been almost exhausted, an interim facility has been established to tide the fund over until the normal three-year replenishment can be concluded. We expect the negotiations to be concluded in the autumn, and we will then have to return the matter to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Donors have pledged £368.5 million to the interim facility. The UK has pledged £40 million, or about 11 per cent, of the total. All pledges to the interim facility will count as contributions to the ninth replenishment when it is concluded. The interim facility will last for six months or until the ninth replenishment becomes effective, whichever is earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The replenishment negotiations provide an important opportunity for donors to set the priorities and the policy and operational agenda for fund activities for the next three years. Those are set out in a donors' report that contains various actions and targets against which progress on the implementation of the replenishment will be monitored. As negotiations on the ninth replenishment are not yet completed, the donors' report is still to be finalised, so it is not available to hon. Members at the moment. Consequently, lending under the interim facility will be based on the existing policy framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Committee, however, that donors have agreed that ADF-IX should have more selectivity and focus, with an increased allocation of resources to agriculture and rural development, health, education, governance, private sector development and regional integration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Field 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say on focus. Will she give us some historical background? I appreciate that we are going back almost 30 years, but the focus has presumably changed given the amount of disease, especially HIV and AIDS, in much of sub-Saharan Africa during the past 15 years. Will the Minister give us some idea about the historical analysis of where the money went from 1973 onwards, and say how thinking has changed and how she envisages that it will change during the next decade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The focus has tended to be on infrastructure and agricultural projects, although transport projects have also been important. I think that I am right in saying that there have tended to be more projects in Africa than in the Caribbean, perhaps not surprisingly because of the focus on economic activity in Africa. I can certainly provide the hon. Gentleman with a breakdown by sector of loans in existence, if that would help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be helpful. I accept that long-term projects to develop infrastructure are important, but the radical depopulation, especially of the younger working population, in parts of Africa is obviously of great concern. I was looking for some guidance on whether the Government had that in mind in targeting projects in particular countries in Africa, or whether their approach to giving money was more general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say a little about the profile, during the mid-1990s the number of loans decreased dramatically, to about 10 or 20 at the lowest point, largely as a result of problems in the fund. We need to consider the profile of spend since a new president was appointed about five years ago—in 1995, I think. Looking at the approvals given last year, health is not specifically mentioned, but would be affected by water supply and sanitation projects. The sort of issues mentioned by the hon. Gentleman relating to the provision of health services would be more influenced by the other sources of spend, in particular, direct support for HIV-AIDS work and the development of health services that we and the EU provide. I can give the hon. Gentleman a profile of the spend or the pattern of loans, but if one considers the historical development, what strikes one the most is the dramatic reduction in the number of loans and the amount of activity during the mid-1990s because of the difficulties in the fund's organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the Department's overall strategy? She referred to investment in the agricultural sector. We have also heard in recent months about the decline in investment in agriculture in Africa by the Commonwealth Development Corporation. There are two chunks of money going in different directions, both within the Department's overall responsibility. What is the overall strategy on where the money should go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The loans are for projects, not grant aid, so although there are operational priorities, where the money goes will depend to a certain extent on where the projects are. It is agreed that agriculture remains the most important sector for the African fund, and that is largely a reflection of the economic activities in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the countries involved. This is not a grant-giving exercise; loans are granted for specific projects. In many countries, economic growth is stifled because, for obvious reasons, they do not have access to finance for development projects. The emphasis that is to be given to enhancing the fund's effectiveness with measurable effects on the ground will be a single action plan to improve development effectiveness, which the fund must report against annually.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Julie Kirkbride 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromsgrove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the Government's aim in giving more money to the banks, but will the Under-Secretary help the Committee by explaining how collateral works in such situations? When the land has no owner, do Government guarantees provide backing? Private property is an issue in some of the countries that we are discussing, and it may not exist as collateral when someone is borrowing money for a private project. How does the bank deal with collateral?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two distinct schemes, both of which could be regarded as soft loans. One of those schemes is interest free, so the assessment of payments and risks will be different from those made by commercial banks, which is why we need the type of activity that we are debating. On occasions, past assessments have been wrong, which has resulted in the large arrears that countries such as the Congo have built up. For obvious reasons, it would be wrong to assess that type of lending using the same criteria that apply to loans in the developed world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Donors have asked management to undertake independent evaluation of the fund's performance in implementing the seventh and eighth replenishment, which is to report before the end of the current negotiating period. Donors have also called for improved links between lending and performance, including a stronger linkage among country-owned poverty-reduction strategies and the bank's country strategy papers. Subject to parliamentary approval, the United Kingdom contribution of £40 million will be payable through deposit of a single promissory note, drawn down over 10 years on the basis of an agreed encashment schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later this year, Department officials will start work on a new institutional strategy paper for the African Development Bank. The current strategy paper was published in November 1999 and set out the United Kingdom's objectives for working with the bank and the fund for a period of three years. Copies of the paper are available from the House of Commons Library and from the Department. In preparing the new strategy paper, we will specifically focus on how the Department can support and help strengthen the African Development Bank and African development fund so that they can play their part in implementing the New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we are pleased to continue the support of successive British Governments for these important institutions, dedicated to working for the elimination of poverty and for sustainable development. I commend these orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an obvious and great attraction in serving on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Griffiths. I am deeply sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) cannot be here today, but by long prearrangement she is hosting the visit of former President Gorbachev to a room not far from this one. I hope that my best efforts will not be too poor a substitute for her encyclopaedic knowledge of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit of our approach is as it was in 1999 or 2000, when similar measures were considered in relation to the African Development Bank. Successive Governments of different political persuasions have supported those bodies and the making of contributions to them. However, our debate on sustainable development and aid for poverty diseases of two days ago, with the same Minister, showed a great level of concern about the situation in Africa in the context of the AIDS pandemic. That concern was expressed on both sides of the House. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will understand that, in those circumstances, we have sought to frame some rather more rigorous questions and searching points in relation to the African development fund than might have been the case in less harrowing circumstances. In a spirit of cooperation, I gave her the opportunity to have a brief prior look—too brief for her opening remarks, but perhaps not too brief for those that she will make later—at the 12 points that I wish to raise in relation to the African development fund. I have fewer points to make about the Caribbean Development Bank; they are more discursive and she will find that absence of advance notice of them is no handicap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point about the African development fund is that we are being asked to approve the substantial sum of £40 million not as part of a final replenishment settlement, but as something to tide us over because the ninth replenishment settlement has not been reached. That is a different situation from that appertaining to the Caribbean Development Bank, in which at least we know the outcome of the fifth replenishment negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK contribution to the eighth replenishment of the African development fund, covering the period 1999–2001, was just over £98.6 million. The proposed £40 million is an interim contribution to the ninth replenishment. When are the negotiations for that likely to be concluded? What indication can the Under-Secretary can give us of the scale of the UK's likely final contribution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Under-Secretary touched on some of these points in her opening remarks, but what methods does DFID employ to monitor the application of funds donated to the ADF? That point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron). Thirdly, are DFID officials or other agents on hand directly to evaluate the success or otherwise of funded projects in Africa?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these initial questions seem too intrusive, I would refer to the First Standing Committee on Delegated
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Legislation on 25 January 2000, when the then Under-Secretary, the right hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) commented that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The African development fund is the concessional lending arm of the African Development Bank. It provides about 1 billion a year of development assistance to 39 of the poorest countries that are not creditworthy enough for African Development Bank loans. The fund is largely financed by donor contributions."</p></blockquote>
He then pointed out that replenishment negotiations for the fund provided an important opportunity for donors to set priorities and the policy and operational agenda for fund activities over the next three years. In the light of what he said then, it seems fair to ask how that monitoring process, and that ability to set priorities and to assess whether or not goals have been achieved, has worked out during the last period during which the fund has been in operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In one recent report, I heard that many of the donor countries were demanding consultants, so the money, instead of going to the countries where it is needed, comes back to the donor countries. How much of this money is coming back through consultancy fees and other activities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for alerting us to that point. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to address it directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to the comments that were made in January 2000, the then Under-Secretary pointed out that the then Secretary of State had approved publication of the DFID institutional strategy paper for the African Development Bank. That set out the Government's objectives for working with the bank for the next three years. I am a little unhappy about what were then set out as the three main objectives of the Government, and I want to take a little time to list them so that people can see whether we have a specific goal in mind when we make such donations, or whether our goal still borders too much on vagueness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first aim of the Government as set out in January 2000 was to continue their support
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the strengthening of the bank through the on-going programme of institutional reforms introduced by the president".</p></blockquote>
We know why that was. The bank had gone off the rails, and a better president had taken control of it and was trying to improve the situation. Nevertheless, it is a little like running to stay in the same place when one of the three main aims is simply to support the bank in getting its act together as an institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aim is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to help the bank to improve its poverty focus so that it can play its part in contributing towards achievement of the international development targets".</p></blockquote>
Again, should it be necessary for a major aim of the Government to be to assist the bank to improve its ability to focus on the problems? I would have thought that the bank's role was to help to solve the problems. If it has trouble focusing on them in the first place, that makes one wonder how effective the organisation is at supplying solutions rather than simply identifying or focusing on problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In one respect, I can see why the Government have mentioned that, as focus is terribly important. For example, we are all aware that the EU overseas aid package does not focus on its prime objective of relieving poverty across the globe. Instead, it pursues political objectives on its borders. The top 10 recipients are all countries that border the EU. Unless the focus is right, the delivery hardly follows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. If an intermediate organisation is between the gift and the recipient for whom one intends the gift to do good, it is important that that organisation is kept up to the mark, is shown to be capable and applies the funds that one gives it for the purposes for which one originally intended them. However, that raises the broader question of whether that is the best way to assist the people in desperate need whom one is trying to help in the first place, if indeed one were channelling funds through a medium that had difficulty focusing on where it should apply the aid rather than applying it in a more efficacious way than one could if one did so it directly through embassies, the British Council, other aid agencies or non-governmental organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend, who raises an obvious question. Why do we not give the money as direct aid rather than through a bank? What are the advantages of giving it as suggested in the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend divines the thrust of part of my line of questioning. I hope that I may gently channel her question through the medium of my contributions in the direction of the Minister, who will be able to reassure us, I trust, that there are certain ways in which intermediate institutions can do a better job than we would if we tried to do all the work ourselves. That is really what we want to hear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was pointed out in some detail in earlier contributions and interventions, a better job is something that has not happened to money channelled through the European Union. The point is not party political. The Secretary of State for International Development has rightly described as a disgrace the way in which the European Union failed to channel funding to, in particular, sub-Saharan Africa and others of the poorest countries, rather than putting it towards the middle-income countries. They may be geographically closer to the European Union itself, but are certainly not the countries most in need of the assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third aim listed in January 2000 was
	<br><blockquote><p>"to start a process of re-engagement between the DF1D Africa division and the bank with a view to helping it to improve the developmental impact of its country programmes."</p></blockquote>
That again suggests some sort of breakdown in the relationship between our DFID operatives and officials and the bank. It certainly suggests, when one examines those three aims, that all was not well with this institution, even though at that time it was already being reported that, under the new president, it had raised its game significantly from the dire straits into which it had got in the early 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue with the fourth of my 12 questions. In January 2000, the then Under-Secretary reported
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
that despite an upturn in performance, the African Development Bank
	<br><blockquote><p>"in terms of the quality of its lending programmes, the bank still has some way to go to reach the level of the other regional development banks."</p></blockquote>
He continued by saying that it was especially
	<br><blockquote><p>"hampered by inadequate staffing and delays in developing the right skills mix".—[
	<i>Official Report, First Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation</i>, 25 January 2000; c. 3.]</p></blockquote>
What improvements have there been in those regards in the past three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the African Development Bank has a broad and extensive range of activities. However, given the increasing importance of the Commonwealth Development Corporation and the increasing extent of its work in Africa, does my hon. Friend think that there is an opportunity, through, dare I say it, joined-up government, to use some of the CDC's expertise to channel the moneys that we are donating to this bank?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry to say that I must disagree entirely with my hon. Friend. What he said would have been absolutely true had we been talking about this prior to the attempt at part privatisation of the CDC. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden encouraged me and others to apply for a one and a half hour Adjournment debate on the subject of the CDC, in which we expressed our grave concern that the CDC was no longer doing the sort of grant giving and loan making on extremely favourable terms that in the past had been so successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought it was a strange choice for the Government's first part-privatisation project and that it was a mistake. We also thought that all sorts of good projects that the CDC had undertaken with considerable success in the past, in terms of humanitarian success rather than simple cash profit and returns, were now having the skids put under them, to put it bluntly, and that the CDC was becoming a much more commercially focused organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I only wish that my hon. Friend's suggestion was a course that we could follow, but I am afraid that our concern is that the CDC is no longer a player in this field to anything like the same extent as it has been under successive Governments since it was set up by the first post-war Labour Government in the late 1940s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth question is to ask what the Government's policy is towards encouraging the African development fund to apply some of its resources as grants rather than interest-free loans as at present. Loans serve to swell the total of irredeemable debts. We are concerned that, in the medium to long term, the giving of loans even on favourable terms could be storing up trouble for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixthly, what input will the Government have in terms of setting priorities for the ADF to apply? We heard that the time of replenishment is when we have an input into the setting of priorities. We would like to know whether that process is under way while the replenishment negotiations continue, or at least what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
input the Government have in assessing the priorities that the ADF has decided that it wants to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seventhly, what indications have there been in recent years of the ADF's fulfilment of its poverty reduction goals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eighthly, what part has good governance played in decisions made by the ADF to give interest-free loans?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ninthly, what can the Minister tell us about the policy of the ADF in respect of Zimbabwe? It would be understandable if anyone trying to help in that area were not to be torn on the basis of good governance. One might say that we should do as little as possible to assist Zimbabwe on the basis of the terrible drought that has struck southern Africa, which has been exacerbated by the incompetence and the criminal neglect and misbehaviour of the Mugabe regime. Nevertheless, humanitarian considerations would lead us to say that we should still assist as much as we can. We are on the horns of a dilemma, and I would be grateful for the Minister's enlightenment as to how the Government intend to approach that problem in relation to their dealings with such bodies as the African development fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My tenth point is whether, South Africa having experienced its worst drought in half a century, the ADF has been able to give practical help to the other countries besides Zimbabwe that have been affected—Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Lesotho? My eleventh point is to ask what assistance the fund has given and what strategy has it developed in respect of the AIDS pandemic? I shall give a small selection of horrifying statistics. It is estimated that a quarter of the adult population in Zimbabwe carries the HIV virus, but that figure rises to 40 per cent, in urban areas and possibly to as much as 80 per cent, in the army. Life expectancy in that benighted country is now poised to fall to merely 38 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, does the Minister view our contributions via the African development fund and the Caribbean Development Bank as a means of compensating for the bias—it has been referred to several times today—in the application of the EU aid budget, which the Secretary of State rightly denounced as disgraceful for its twisted priorities and its bias against helping the poorest countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be relieved to know that I have only six questions on the Caribbean Development Bank. First, in a positive vein, I note that, according to DFID, the CDB's strengths lie in its close contact with its borrower member countries, which enables it to be in tune with their needs and to offer them good access to policy makers in the Caribbean. DFID describes the CDB as a specialist Caribbean institution, staffed by people from the region, and says that Caribbean countries have a high degree of ownership of, and commitment to, the bank. CDB's local knowledge and its location within the region, therefore, provide it with a comparative advantage in processing small and medium-sized loans that the larger multilateral development banks find too costly to administer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the attitude that the Opposition have taken towards the Commonwealth Development Corporation and its over-commercialisation, it would
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
be odd and totally inconsistent if we did not applaud the CDB for being able to make precisely the sort of loans, on precisely the sort of generous terms to precisely the same sort of people who need our help, that the CDC used to make but which it sadly no longer appears to be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concerns are as follows. The first is whether the loans being made are adding to the cycle of unpayable debt. We would like to be given assurances by the Government that the Caribbean Development Bank does not and will not adopt irresponsible lending policies to poor countries, specifically from the concessional lending arm and special development fund, which is precisely the arm that will receive the £17.5 million that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, some development banks have lent money to poor countries when there was very little chance of the loans being repaid, no matter how generous the repayment terms. That, combined with poverty levels in poor countries and with incompetent government, has led to unsustainable debt burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, many of the poorest countries receive debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, but debt relief is only part of the solution. Unsustainable debt can become a vicious circle, and the manner in which poor countries are lent money must be reformed. Poor countries will never exit unsustainable debt burdens unless development banks adopt more responsible lending policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second concern relates to encouraging diversification in the Caribbean economies. The countries that borrow from the Caribbean Development Bank are, for the most part, island communities, which generally depend on tourism and exporting one or two commodities, such as sugar and bananas. As such, they are exceptionally vulnerable to market forces. A downturn in prices for sugars and bananas is hitting Caribbean economies hard, and it is important that they are encouraged to diversify as far as possible into other industries and exports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
DFID appears to have some reservations about the capacity of the Caribbean Development Bank to encourage diversification in Caribbean economies. According to a DFID institutional strategy paper,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the CDB's structure has limited capacity to react quickly to the changing needs of its borrowers".</p></blockquote>
The paper also says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"capacity constraints and the CDB's limited research and analytical capacity have not allowed the Bank to play a major role in policy dialogue with Caribbean governments, or on the wider social and economic challenges facing the region".</p></blockquote>
What actions are the Government taking to improve the CDB's capacity to respond to the borrowing environment's changing requirements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I come to the impact of trade liberalisation on developing countries. The Opposition support moves to liberalise trade as a means of promoting economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but many countries will have to make preparations for the impact of such liberalisation. Many African producers produce commodities at lower costs than their Caribbean counterparts: sugar and bananas crop up yet again. What does the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Caribbean Development Bank propose to do to assist Caribbean exporters whose livelihoods will suffer as a result of agricultural liberalisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point concerns accountability. What supervision does the Secretary of State—or, in this case, the Minister—envisage for the distribution of CDB funds? Will there be direct authorisation by DFID of decisions taken by the Caribbean Development Bank? As far as we know, there has been no real study of the effectiveness of the CDB's lending policies. Studies of the World Bank's concessional lending suggest that unscrupulous government diverted an unacceptable number of past loans for their own benefit. According to 
	<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> of 26 July 2001, the World Bank's own evaluation is that less than one third of its projects in poor countries yield "satisfactory and sustainable results". Is the situation any better at the Caribbean Development Bank?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth point is about duplication. The Caribbean Development Bank is not the only bank that lends to Caribbean countries. The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Investment Bank also lend to the region. In fact, the CDB accounts for only about 16 per cent, of multilateral development bank lending to CDB borrowing members. What links and partnerships are there between the CDB and those other regional development banks to prevent unnecessary duplication of resources and to ensure that funds are allocated more efficiently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the World Bank competes with regional development banks causes some worry. Regional development banks compete with the World Bank for donor funds, clients and projects, and their local offices are often in the same cities. The regional banks repeat the World Bank's organisational structure, yet, in the year 2000, the World Bank expanded its field offices, increasing duplication and potential conflict in the regions. When the United States Government investigated, they received no reasonable explanation why such costly expansion was chosen over closer co-operation with the regional banks and reliance on their personnel. To what extent do the operations of the CDB and the World Bank overlap?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer again to the question of grants versus loans. Has there been any suggestion that the Caribbean Development Bank might turn some of its loans into grants? The World Bank recently decided to administer approximately 20 per cent, of its loans to the poorest countries in the form of grants, which are given on condition that the money is well spent and there is no corruption. The value of grants is that they do not have to be repaid, which avoids the prospect of the poorest countries accumulating unpayable debt burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision by the World Bank to convert 20 per cent, of its loans into grants was highly controversial. The United States originally proposed that up to 50 per cent, of loans should be converted into grants, a figure that was reduced to 20 per cent, after a long period of
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
negotiation. Our Secretary of State was strongly opposed to the US proposals, maintaining that if the World Bank did not expect the money to be repaid, its future funding would be cast into doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a long series of questions, but I know that the Minister has a great deal of material at her fingertips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Turner 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can tell us whether he and his party will support the two draft orders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made it clear in my opening remarks that there has always been consensus over the funding of these organisations. Given what has been happening in Africa, however, we believe that in order to justify spending so much money—the hon. Gentleman should compare the amount that has been spent in the past with what we are proposing to approve today—we would be failing in our duty if we did not subject the proposals, as well as the operations of the organisations involved, to the closest scrutiny. We have no intention of opposing the granting of the awards today, but we hope to put down a strong and comprehensive series of markers, which will enable those who come after us and look back at today's debate, in perhaps three years' time—just as we look back at the debate held over the African development fund in January 2000—to see to what extent these organisations deserve the support that they will continue to receive today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my list of questions is so lengthy, but I am sure that the Minister will appreciate, particularly following the expressions of concern made in European Standing Committee B, only two days ago, about the terrible crisis—indeed, the holocaust of the AIDS pandemic—in Africa, that there is strong feeling that the necessarily limited aid that is given by the wealthy countries to the poorest should not be frittered away through inefficiency, incompetence or corruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.24 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can be brief, but I have a number of questions. First, I did not entirely understand the reasons for the delay in negotiations for the ninth replenishment. The hon. Gentleman immediately behind the Minister was coughing as she was giving her explanation, and I missed half of it. He is now outside having a cigarette—a way of continuing the problem. Will the hon. Lady explain a little further the reasons for the delay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in an intervention that the Minister kindly allowed me, I mentioned the repayment record in respect of the African development fund, and she mentioned the poor record of the Congo. I am interested to know the overall record of repayment. The Minister indicated that she might be able to come up with an answer later in the debate. I should be pleased if she can tell us about it, and compare it with previous years. I appreciate that she might not have all the information, but an indication of whether there is an improvement in repayment would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The third point relates to the overall strategy of the Department and how the various pieces of the jigsaw fit together. I have already mentioned the CDC, an operation that is investing in development through making loans. I want to understand better how that and the fund fit together and how they fit with New Partnership for Africa's Development. The Government, rightly in my view, are putting great store by that new approach to development, which seeks to empower African nations and allow them to come up with solutions based on good governance and improving economic performance. How does the investment strategy of that body fit with NEPAD? Will there be a close relationship between the fund and those responsible for developing NEPAD?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point relates to an earlier question. The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) spoke about the fund's troubled past and the introduction of a new fund chairman in 1995. How has the fund performed in the seven years since then? Is there any evidence of improvement? I appreciate that there are problem areas, including the Congo, and I appreciate that the fund is operating in a difficult environment, but is there any sign that things have started moving in the right direction? Can we be confident that further investment will be worth while? All who are committed to development assistance need to know that the money is being spent wisely and that it will be effective in the core aim of the Department, which is the alleviation of poverty and the creation of sustainable development. What confidence can we have that its future performance will be effective?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is about the Caribbean Development Bank. The Minister said that it had been quite effective in raising the necessary funds, particularly as a number of European countries had pulled out of the bank. Why was that? Could it be because several European countries have reduced their spending on development assistance, or was it because of real concerns about how the bank was performing? I should be grateful if the Minister could answer my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. Griffiths. I support the speeches made by the spokesmen for both Opposition parties. The debate has been informative and interesting, but the case still needs to be made as to why we spend the money in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one suggests that we should spend less than we do on developing countries or that there is not more to be done. The Government's work in the past few years in helping to alleviate poverty in the third world is a credit to them. However, my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East raises a significant question, which is that if the African Development Bank acts as a bank and gives countries loans, why are we pursuing the policy of giving soft loans—at some point, such loans technically need to be repaid—to countries that have no hope of ever repaying them? The countries will become further overburdened by such debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
In this Room, we share the aim of alleviating the problems of the many across the world who live in gross and dire poverty. As many as 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day. To give their countries a loan of any description seems a rather curious way to offer aid, given that the British Exchequer has no expectation of getting any of the money back. I am sure that the Minister has good reason for it, but the case still needs to be made if there is no collateral. If there is no obvious repayment method, why do we offer loans instead of grants? That is the principal question that needs to be answered. It applies especially to Africa, where the problems are great, but it can also apply to Caribbean countries. Although they are not as poor in most respects, they are extremely poor compared with the western world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to hear more about the priority given to the various projects. The two Front-Bench spokesmen for the Opposition parties raised significant concerns about the operation of the African development fund and its past problems, so to offer another £40 million as an interim payment to such an organisation raises significant questions. It would help if the Minister explained her confidence in the ADF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say more about how the British Government would seek to influence the prioritisation of the ADF's projects? The problems of Africa seem simple in terms of obvious ways forward. It needs more infrastructure, more clean water and more products to be sold abroad. Then more health and education are required, so that the improvement can be self-sustaining. It is simply not possible for Africa to help itself, given the great gap between rich and poor nations and the need to pay back capital and loans. It needs money, and sometimes help in strategic directions so that whatever we do can be self-sustaining and self-financing for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's aim of not loaning but giving more money to developing countries. The money has to be properly targeted, but I would be interested in further clarification as to the manner in which we propose to achieve that aim through the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to answer all the questions that have been raised. If I do not, I shall follow them up in writing. It might be helpful at the start to make clear the scale of what has been done at the African Development Bank, as that will put into context quite a number of the questions. Following the decline that I mentioned in the mid-1990s, only 14 approvals were given across the whole of Africa. The figure rose to 20 in 1995, 33 in 1996 and 112 in 1997, and it has now reached 144.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem earlier was that the bank was in such a state that it was not lending money. It might not have escaped Opposition Members that the first year in which activity really started to pick up was also the first full year of the Labour Government. I hope that Conservative Members who are concerned about ensuring that there is aid for Africa were as persistent in pressing their own Government to ensure that it received direct aid and loans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over and above the issues raised by both Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen, there is the issue of whether loans and grants are made sensibly. There is clearly a due diligence process, and although there were great concerns in the early to mid-1990s, many have been rectified. Beyond the number of loans, however, there is surely the issue of the amount of money involved, and the Minister may be able to give us some guidance on that. She has referred to the number of loans, but not to the amounts. Different sorts of project may be funded at different times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will indeed give hon. Members the guidance that the hon. Gentleman seeks. At the low point in 1995, the amount of the loans was $802 million; in 2001, however, it was $2.9 billion. The size of the spend has therefore roughly followed the same pattern as the number of loans. That puts in context some of the concerns that have been expressed about the bank's operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I was quite concerned about arrears, and I have asked a lot of questions about that subject, so I share Opposition Members' concerns. The figures that I have were all published, so there is nothing dramatic about them. The figure for the Democratic Republic of Congo is $633 million, while the next highest figure, for Liberia, is $139.66 million. Those are very large amounts, but they are historic, and action has been taken to deal with them. It might help hon. Members if I described what has been done, although I shall try to be reasonably quick because we have a lot of questions to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In three countries—Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan—most of the arrears date from the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since 1995, the bank has had in place a strict credit policy, which restricts access to non-concessional lending to only 13 creditworthy African countries. I cannot remember offhand which they are, but they are obviously at the wealthier end of spectrum and include Morocco, Tunisia and South Africa. All the other countries are eligible only for lending from the African development fund's concessional window, which is interest-free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ADB has the most stringent arrears sanctions policy of all the regional development banks. All disbursements and new loan approvals are suspended for borrowers whose debt service repayments are more than 30 days overdue. I understand that Zimbabwe is in arrears and would not qualify for new loans. I hope that that answers the question that the hon. Member for New Forest, East asked about Zimbabwe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
DRC arrears to the African Development Bank are substantially larger than those to the IMF or the World Bank. Following some progress on a political settlement in the Congo, a plan was agreed in June to clear the arrears to all those institutions. Some $42 million from the African development fund's interim facility will be used to clear the ADF arrears, and contributions are being sought to clear part of the much larger bank arrears. The arrears in the Congo are owed in part to the bank and in part to the development fund, so that the rest can be consolidated and managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The UK fully supports the bank's plans for clearing arrears of the DRC and has pledged that $5 million be made available once further progress had been made in the peace process. We also hope that the Congo will become eligible in early 2003 for debt relief under the HIPC initiative. The debt arrears of the Congo is a major issue, but it is difficult to make progress so long as there is conflict in the country. I have covered a number of hon. Members' questions, and I hope to go through the remainder as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given examples of arrears figures for Congo, Liberia and one other country. Is there any statistic that shows overall performance and whether the arrears figures improve year on year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the policy for new arrears was introduced in 1995, and arrangements are being made to deal with the old ones. The hon. Gentleman is welcome to have the full list of arrears figures, which appears in the bank's annual report and covers 14 or 15 countries. It is freely available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go through the points that were raised by the hon. Member for New Forest, East and hope that I cover all of them. He asked when the process was likely to be concluded. It is likely to be in September or October, as I mentioned. The figure is still to be decided, but we would expect it to be about £120 million. In terms of the monitoring, there is supposed to be a mid-term review. There will also be one for the Caribbean Development Bank. Quite a number of mechanisms are being considered for improving performance, such as the use of a number of country offices that can keep a close watch on what happens. Day to day monitoring is done by the executive board, on which we have a governor, and that has an annual meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the quality of staffing. Reorganisation has ensured that skilled staff are recruited, and that the staffing structure is reassessed. He picked up on questions asked by other hon. Members about the roles of grants and of loans. The most obvious answer regarding the loans is that if the money is repaid, it can be recycled. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove said that there was no point in providing loans to countries that cannot manage them. I would point out that in the cases of both the African Development Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank careful consideration is given to lending policy in order to ensure that it is appropriate to the state of each country's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The African bank is specifically precluded from receiving loans that attract interest, albeit at reasonable rates. Of 52 African countries are in real financial difficulty, 39 are denied access to that kind of loan. Care is taken to look at the state of each country so that it does not get into a pattern of unsustainable debt. If countries do get into arrears, the bank has strict policies to ensure that those are dealt with, so that they do not simply build up debt upon debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a wider issue to address. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove said that Africa could not help itself, but some African countries can help themselves. Some, even if they are in some financial difficulty by our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
standards, have functioning economies and can take on loan commitments. That is an important part of building up the financial systems of countries to ensure that they have access to loans for the type of projects that they want to carry out. It is important that they have that facility. Several hon. Members have asked about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reply may deal with the point that the hon. Member for New Forest, East made about good governance. The performance of countries is taken into account, and if they start to default on their debts they are not given access to new loans. That may be the toughest sanction of them all. I dealt with the hon. Gentleman's point about Zimbabwe. He asked about drought-related problems in southern Africa. The assistance required there is longer term and given in aid. We have programmes that address those problems. In addition, the ADF has helped agricultural projects, which over the years have accounted for the vast bulk of the loans provided. I can give the hon. Gentleman an exact breakdown, if he wants it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and a number of others asked on several occasions about AIDS, especially in Africa where the figures are horrendous. The bank's annual report recognises the impact that AIDS is having on the economy of African countries. In a previous debate, it was mentioned that the impact of AIDS would hold back the growth rate in some African countries by 8 or 9 percentage points. The illness is taking out some of the economically active in the community—especially the professionals, such as teachers and health workers—with a knock-on effect on all other economic indicators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bank recognises that the issue is what should be done. The strategy document recognises that, but states also that the bank does not have the expertise to work in that area. It recognises the need for close working, but also refers to the lead that must be given to other specialised institutions. The countries involved called on the fund to work closely with other institutions to ensure that the problems were tackled, including the United Nations agencies and the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, for which we recently discussed funding. The other agencies need to take the lead because they have the expertise in the health sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked several questions about the functioning of the regional banks. Banks have an expertise because they operate in specific areas. There are four of them, although we have discussed only two this afternoon; there are also banks in Asia and Latin America. The banks can develop a level of expertise, local knowledge and scrutiny that would not be possible if they were further afield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a few issues about the objectives of the Caribbean Development Bank. I agree that if one pulls a line out of a strategy document, it can look somewhat banal on its own, but the strategy document from which he was quoting sets out in considerable detail the thinking behind the individual headlines. It is important that loans should focus on measures to reduce poverty, not measures that might build up an elitist economy. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
precisely the debate that lies behind much of the criticism of how the EU works, which has been repeated by some Opposition Members. It is important for the British Government to focus not only on poverty reduction, but on ensuring that all the partner organisations with which we work, including the development banks and the EU, also focus on that objective. We must try to ensure that they do not provide funds to middle-range countries and do not get "projectitis"; funding individual projects that have no link to a coherent strategy. We must ensure that the strategies of both the African and Caribbean banks focus on poverty reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of why we should provide loans to desperately poor Caribbean countries underpinned many of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I know that it might seem incongruous, but the Caribbean countries are not ranked among those with the lowest income, although it is recognised that they have some particular difficulties and areas of weakness. The thinking behind the provision of loans to Caribbean countries reflects the very different position of those countries and the fact that their economies are at different stages. I think that there are about four categories of loans, so that loans of differing lengths, levels of interest and interest-free periods are made to different countries. The thinking behind that is to focus on areas of poverty in countries that, to some extent, are pulling themselves out of the situation that exists in Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unsure whether it was the hon. Member for New Forest, East or the hon. Member for Bromsgrove who talked about unsustainable debts. The HIPC initiative focuses on that problem but, to a certain extent, all countries have loans because that is part of a functioning economy. The relevant issue is the relationship between debt and gross domestic product. That analysis has fuelled our debt relief programme. It is not wrong per se to provide loans to poor Governments. Loans can help to recycle funds and to ensure that poor countries have access to loan facilities that they would not otherwise have, enabling them to improve their economies. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove said, "All they need is water", but to provide water, countries must have the necessary infrastructure, which many loans help to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several issues were raised about the effectiveness of monitoring. Again, I point hon. Members to the wide range of measures that have been taken by both the banks to ensure that proper systems are in place and correctly applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) asked about several issues, including the repayment record, which I hope that I have dealt with. The delays to which he referred resulted from the need to resolve the issues surrounding grants and loans. He also asked about NEPAD's involvement and its attitude to the bank. I do not know about that; I shall have to write to him. I have flicked through the papers on NEPAD, but I have not seen its comments on the African bank. A number of them are clearly involved and have an active part in the bank, and a great number also receive loans from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked about performance and repayment. I dealt with that when I spoke about the problems of organising debt repayments. He also said that some countries had pulled out, and asked whether it was because the fund was not working properly or because they had other priorities. It was indeed that they had other priorities; they decided to spend their money in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove asked about the rationale for making loans rather than giving grants. I hope that I have set that out fully. One country that is rated as being among the very poor but is still more than capable of coping with a loan is Kenya. That country's economy has a substantial private sector that is projected to grow, but it does not fit the pattern that the hon. Lady described. That country shows that we need to get away from aid dependency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have before me a note on the bank's role in NEPAD. The NEPAD heads of state implementation committee has given the development bank the lead agency role, so it is recognised by African leaders as having an important role to play in the development of the various countries of the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered most if not all the questions that I have been asked today. I hope also that hon. Members recognise that it is extremely important not only that we help countries in the Caribbean and in Africa but that we enable those
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
countries to help themselves. That is why we provide them not only with aid but give them the chance to take out loans to fund projects. Indeed, one of the necessities in building up the economies of African and Caribbean countries is that they should have access to finance, and the regional development banks provide an important way of doing that. The banks also provide a level of expertise and commitment that might not be available from general lending institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that we might have to look again at the final allocations to the African development fund but I hope that, in recognition of the serious difficulties in Africa, hon. Members will agree to the replenishment of the Caribbean fund and to the interim payment for the African development fund. I commend the orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
