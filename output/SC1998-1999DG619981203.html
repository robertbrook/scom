	<div class='legislation'>Value Added Tax (Input Tax) (Amendment) Order 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Value Added Tax (Input Tax) (Amendment) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998, No. 2767).</p></blockquote>
The order deals specifically with an avoidance issue that has occurred with the arrangements for value added tax on the leasing of cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to fairness in taxation. As part of that commitment, we are determined to deal with all tax avoidance swiftly and surely. The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) will confirm that the previous Government took a similar view and dealt swiftly with direct challenges to the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When tax is avoided through the use of artificial schemes, fairness is undermined, making the burden disproportionate. Some businesses are forced to pay higher taxes because those that do not want to pay the full rate use creative tax devices. The order prevents the use of one of those creative tax devices, which the Government find unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is an anti-avoidance measure. We have acted quickly to tackle a blatant avoidance scheme that has been marketed, unfortunately, by some of the leading accountants. VAT revenue of about £20 million is at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order closes a loophole in the VAT rules that apply to private motoring in leased company cars. It is a complex matter, involving VAT and input and output tax. I shall do my best to assist the Committee by explaining the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In August 1995, the previous Government changed the rules on taxing such private motoring. The change was a business facilitation measure intended to benefit leasing businesses and their customers in the finance and insurance sectors. The change replaced one method of taxing private use with another. At the time of the change, special transitional rules prevented double taxation. Some businesses—not all—with large company car fleets have abused a loophole in the transitional rules. The order deals with only those companies that have used such schemes. All other businesses—the vast majority that has used the rules legitimately—will be unaffected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The avoidance scheme involves interposing an artificial leasing company between a real leasing company and its business customer, and making artificial pre-payments to the artificial leasing company. Unfortunately, such
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
arrangements are not unfamiliar in different aspects of taxation for various reasons, and this Government and the previous Government have always acted swiftly against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the old rules, VAT on the purchase of leased cars could not be recovered, but all the VAT incurred on the leasing charges was recoverable. Under the new rules, VAT on the purchase of leased cars is recoverable, but only half the VAT on leasing charges can be recovered. Using the avoidance scheme, all the VAT on the purchase and on the leasing charges is recovered, so completely avoiding taxation on the private use of company cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put it simply, two schemes relating to VAT and leasing are available. Those schemes—the choice of which depends on the sector, and which we will call option A and option B—provide for the recovery of VAT at different points. The avoidance scheme built a bridge between option A and option B, thereby providing the benefits of both options. I am sure that that was never the intention of the previous Government, as such a scheme provides no taxation at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private motoring in business cars is taxed by limiting the amount of VAT that businesses can recover on the purchase or lease of the car. That simplified procedure avoids the need for businesses to keep detailed records of business and private mileage, and was agreed on the establishment of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before 1 August 1995, VAT incurred on the purchase of a car by a leasing company could not be recovered. VAT on the subsequent charges made by the leasing company to its customer was recoverable by the customer in the normal way. From 1 August 1995, VAT on the purchase of the car could be recovered by the leasing company, but only half of the VAT incurred on the leasing charges could be recovered by the customer where the car was available for private use. VAT could still be recovered in full on the leasing charges where—in rare cases—no private use was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transitional measures were put in place that excluded pre-existing leases from the new arrangements, and attempted to counteract avoidance schemes that might seek to circumvent the new arrangements by artificially bringing forward the dates of leases. The order addresses the loophole in those transitional measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leading accountants marketed a packaged avoidance scheme that took advantage of the loophole by inserting an artificial associated leasing company between the real leasing schemes and the business customer arrangements. A business using that scheme could still lease cars benefiting from the full VAT recovery on the leasing charge and the full VAT recovery on purchase. Such cars would be obtained VAT-free, which is contrary to Parliament's clear intention—in amendments introduced by the previous Government—in relation to cars that are available for private use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to answer any questions from hon. Members after I explain what happened in the courts.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Customs contested the scheme—the placing of an artificial leasing company—in the VAT tribunal and the courts. They won in the High Court but lost the argument in the Court of Appeal. Article 2(b) of the order limits the recovery by the associated artificial leasing company to half of the VAT incurred on leasing charges if it has sub-let the cars concerned before 1 August 1995. The change only applies to leasing charges invoiced or paid on or after 13 November 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change protects against the use of the avoidance scheme in future. Very little tax has been lost so far, but we must ensure that the scheme is not used more widely. Therefore, following the Court of Appeal loss, we felt that we should take quick and sure action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, the amendment corrects a small technical loophole that was, unfortunately, in the provisions in 1995. I am not casting any blame; with the best will in the world it is difficult for Ministers and officials when drafting legislation to ensure that the most creative tax planners do not find a way in which to abuse it. Under the 1995 provisions, there was a tiny opportunity to do that, which was exploited and led to a loss of revenue and which would have led to a considerable future loss in revenue if we had not taken action new. The order is specific and targeted. It will enable the previous Government's intentions to be realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Financial Secretary tell the Committee when Her Majesty's Customs and Excise first became aware of how the scheme operated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have to hand the precise date when Customs and Excise challenged the scheme before the case reached the tribunal system. Naturally, I shall let the right hon. Gentleman have the information before the end of the sitting. He has raised an important point about such avoidance schemes and how long it takes for the Government to challenge their use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Financial Secretary cares to correct me, I think that Customs and Excise thought mistakenly that it was on a winner with the BRS case. Can the hon. Lady confirm that Customs lost the case at the initial VAT tribunal? It won in the High Court, but it lost the case in the Court of Appeal. What advice was given by counsel to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise at the beginning of that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm the remarks of the hon. Gentleman. We won the case in the High Court, but lost it in the Court of Appeal. The case was contested so vigorously because the legal advice given to Customs and Excise was that we would win. We did not. Our only option new is to correct the legislation, which is what we are doing under the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.42 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Financial Secretary for her opening statement and for her responses to my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon 
	<i>(Mr. Burnett)</i> which have
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
helped to clarify the order. As the hon. Lady said, the intricacies of VAT law are complex at the best of times. The order deals with a narrow and complicated application of the rules that govern input tax credits and demands even more wet towels round the head than is usual in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Financial Secretary explained, the background to the order is the change that was made on 1 August 1995 concerning VAT treatment of vehicles purchased by leasing companies. That change, which allowed leasing companies to reclaim 100 per cent. of the VAT while restricting businesses taking out leases to being able to reclaim only 50 per cent. of the VAT, was welcomed widely by the leasing trade at the time. It was, in general, supported by the then Opposition. Indeed, the hon. Lady was the Treasury spokesman at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme that was set up to take advantage of the different regimes that operated before and after 1 August 1995 was indisputably a blatant device to avoid paying tax. Like the Financial Secretary, I am surprised that it was allowed by the Court of Appeal. The Opposition will certainly not seek to preserve it or to oppose the order. I would, however, be grateful if the Financial Secretary could clarify several points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the order, my understanding of the way in which the scheme works—I apologise for examining the matter again but I want to be sure that I have got it clear in my mind—is that a lessee who entered an agreement with a leasing company prior to 1 August 1995 could reclaim 100 per cent. of the VAT on the leasing charge. If the leasing company obtained the vehicles after 1 August, however, it could also reclaim 100 per cent. of the VAT. In simple terms, it was an arbitrage scheme that exploited the changeover date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, the lessee had to enter into an agreement while the previous regime was in force—that is, before 1 August 1995. The likelihood is, however, that the primary period for the lease would be no more than three years; indeed, it would probably be shorter because those involved would be anxious to take advantage of the scheme before it could be changed. It is, therefore, likely that higher payments would be made for a shorter period. In any case, it is unlikely that any agreement is still in its primary period today. As a result, any leases that were taken out using the scheme are almost bound to be in the secondary period on a peppercorn rent. However, the Customs and Excise press release and the Financial Secretary both state that the measure is not retrospective and applies only to future lease payments. To some extent, therefore, it is shutting the stable door after the horse was bolted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it a little difficult to see how Customs and Excise have come up with the figure of £20 million for the amount of revenue that the measure protects. Given that it is not clear how new schemes could have been taken out and that payments under the old schemes have in large part been made, the revenue at stake would be only a fraction of that amount. My understanding of precisely how the scheme works may be incorrect, but that is how it appears to me. I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary would clarify the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I want to make one or two general observations about the arrangements that govern the payment of VAT on leased vehicles. When the matter was originally debated in July 1995, the Financial Secretary said that the 50 per cent. block on VAT on leasing charges and the 100 per cent. block to input VAT on outright purchase were a rough and ready alternative to directly imposing VAT on the private use of business cars. She rightly said that that approach created a distortion in the market for the provision of cars. If a business leases a car that is not used exclusively for business purposes, it can reclaim 50 per cent. of the VAT. If it purchases a car that is not used exclusively for business purposes, however, it can reclaim no VAT. That is not wholly satisfactory; indeed, the artificiality of that device originally gave rise to the avoidance scheme that prompted the measure that we are debating. Why has the hon. Lady rejected the alternative that she suggested when in opposition? Moving to a system under which VAT is charged on the private use of business vehicles would allow businesses to reclaim a proportion of VAT that was equivalent to the proportion of time during which the vehicle was used for business purposes. The system of clawback, which is used by Customs and Excise for other business assets, could then be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that such a case-by-case assessment might be bureaucratic and administratively expensive for small businesses. The Financial Secretary referred to the need to keep an account of the mileage that was recorded in each specific circumstance. I understand, however, that such a system operates in Germany, where it appears to work. I do not see why it could not be made to work here. It would seem fairer, and would remove the distortion identified by the Financial Secretary. Will she address that point? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members whisper, sotto voce, "harmonisation". The Financial Secretary will be aware that a few months ago the European Commission made proposals to harmonise rules relating to the recovery of VAT incurred in other member states, and to introduce common rules for input tax blocking for business expenses. The Commission proposes that member states should have the option to apply the normal rules of deduction or a simplified system for motor cars. I have described the usual rules, which apply in Germany. The simplified system proposed by the Commission would require member states to set another limit on input tax recovery, which must not be lower than 50 per cent. If the proportion of business use of the car in question were below that limit, the usual rules would apply. If that proportion were 50 per cent. or more, the ceiling would apply, and 50 per cent. of VAT incurred on expenditure on the car would be deductible input tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission' s proposal appears to be a halfway house between the system that applies in the UK and that which applies in Germany. I do not advocate to the Committee that we should sign up to harmonisation proposals from the Commission. The proposal is on the table, however, and it will be debated during coming months. Will the Financial Secretary comment on it, and does she feel that it can be squared with the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>10.51 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As both previous speakers have mentioned, the order is necessary because of drafting errors in the transitional provisions applying to VAT on private cars and their leasing in respect of the interposition between lessor and lessee of an artificial leasing company. The matter was highlighted in the Court of Appeal when Customs and Excise lost a case involving BRS Ltd. Liberal Democrats support vigorous action to combat tax avoidance, so we support the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two questions. First, the order comes into force on 13 November 1998. Did Customs and Excise announce on that date the Government's intention to make the order? Secondly, will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee whether the order affects contracts made before 13 November 1998 but VAT supplies made only after that date? Will a form of time apportionment apply in respect of VAT supplies pre and post 13 November 1998?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both speakers referred to the history of the matter, and the tardiness with which the order has been laid before us. I am anxious to know how much revenue Customs and Excise has lost because of the scam. The Financial Secretary said that £20 million was at risk. Customs should at least be able to give a pretty accurate estimate of the VAT lost to the Exchequer by the use of this scam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maldon East and Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), spoke of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. To some extent my previous question to the Financial Secretary will provide an answer. How much tax has been lost and how much revenue is it anticipated that Customs and Excise will gain as a result of the order? As has been said, the vast majority of the leases will now be in their secondary period—1995 was a long time ago and most of the leases are for a three-year primary period. That is where the money is and, therefore, where the tax is. In the secondary period, the rental is nominal with a very low rate of value added tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to talk about cars for disabled people and the Motability scheme. First, will the Financial Secretary confirm whether the legislation impacts at all on that important scheme? Secondly, will she enlighten the Committee as to the VAT treatment in future of new and used cars leased to disabled people or for the use of disabled people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support any measure that deals with closing tax loopholes and avoidance schemes. I recognise that there are difficulties in taking action in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before making any specific comments, I seek some reassurance from the Financial Secretary about the nature of the measure before us. We are being asked to approve the modification of paragraph (2C) in the original legislation. I had a look at the original principal order, only to find that paragraph (2C) did not exist. It was only when I got down to the small print of this order—a footnote—that I found that paragraph (2C) was inserted by article 6 of Statutory Instrument 1995/1666. Will the Financial Secretary assure us that the order affects the totality of the legislative universe that we are being asked
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
to amend? Does there exist, and will there be, a consolidated form of this legislation? It is a complex matter and it takes a long time to put together all the pieces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to agree that it is a complex scheme. It strikes me as a relatively straightforward anti-avoidance scheme with just the interposition of one artificial leasing company. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that shoddy draftsmanship is responsible for this problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not necessarily attack the draftsmanship until I had spoken to the draftsmen and known what was in their mind when putting together the legislation. In fairness to Customs and Excise and to those at the Inland Revenue—with whom, in my former incarnation, I had many dealings—they try hard to draft to hit the mark, but are up against some very creative minds in leading accountancy companies, as the Financial Secretary referred to those mystery sinners. I shall say more about them in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are parliamentarians who are trying to put together a complete picture of the legislation that we are being invited to amend. My point was to request a consolidated version, so that if we have to revisit this territory, we can at least see the totality of the universe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the central point raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon—whether it is a question of bad drafting—I think that in framing tax law, people draft to the best of their ability. Sometimes error creeps in, but sometimes someone sees a perspective that was not foreseen and exploits it. That is how avoidance schemes arise. That brings me to a central issue. In the light of yet another avoidance scheme, what effort is Customs and Excise making to re-examine other potential weaknesses in legislation and to make certain in the light of experience that it is as bomb-proof as possible to further avoidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarification, is the hon. Gentleman asking whether Customs and Excise is conducting a review of every piece of legislation for anti-avoidance challenges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To do that for every piece of legislation would be asking too much, but I seek reassurance that Customs and Excise is looking at areas where it feels vulnerable. It was not all that long ago that the Financial Secretary was chastising the then Government for losses of value added tax and looking closely at the legislative solutions that we proposed to deal with the matter. I would like to be reassured that the new Government are looking carefully at value added tax legislation where they feel that it is vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order concerns a VAT avoidance scheme. Will the Financial Secretary say a word or two about how the proposals currently out to consultation on a general piece of legislation covering avoidance might impact on such schemes? She mentioned two leading accountancy companies which were behind the scheme. I happen to know which two companies are involved. I found that out from a confidential source, and I shall respect that
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
confidence. I know that the Financial Secretary could not possibly comment on details of taxpayer information. However, does she believe that a little naming and shaming about avoidance schemes might not be a good way to deter people from constructing them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Avoidance schemes are very clever; they earn the companies concerned a lot of money, but they mean that the losses of revenue have to be made up elsewhere—we will come to the figure of £20 million in a moment. It is the universe of legitimate taxpayers who eventually have to pay the bill. Is the Financial Secretary prepared to name and shame those companies this morning? She knows who they are, I know who they are, and it is about time that we exposed them for devising schemes that put legitimate revenue at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explore paragraph 5 of notes to editors in Customs and Excise news release 28/98, which deals specifically with the order. In its usual helpful way, Customs has tried to translate the order into plain English, so that we might understand it. In paragraph 5, it talks about it affecting "future supplies of leasing." The arrangements under which everybody could have their cake and eat it by fully recovering VAT were put in place in 1995, so cars that may have been used for legitimate business purposes may well now be in the secondhand market and not being leased. In one sense, however, paragraph 5 seems to allow the leasing arrangements to supply goods to continue in such a way that VAT is still avoided. Will the Financial Secretary say whether, having got the agreements in place, traders can continue to supply motor vehicles in perpetuity? If so, there would be an obvious need to take action in the light of the court's findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked when Customs first knew about this avoidance for a good reason. The Financial Secretary said that she would tell me when the first challenge came. She will be aware that there is a precedent for the Treasury to take action if blatant avoidance is discovered, without necessarily waiting for a court decision. Why did Customs and Excise wait as long as it did? When did it find out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can now give the right hon. Gentleman that date: he will then have to answer his own question. The avoidance scheme became apparent shortly after 1 August 1995, when the Conservative Government put the order in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we have to accept blame as former Ministers, the Financial Secretary is right to supply us with that telling information. It makes the more general point about why, once the problem was discovered, it took so long to deal with it. Will the Financial Secretary tell us in more detail when Ministers were first advised of the problem? Can she tell us why customs did not push harder to make certain that the loophole was closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish making this point. In paragraph 6 of the press notice, we see that the measure protects £20 million of Revenue. I go back to the important question of how much has already been lost. We have not yet been told.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows full well that two years elapsed between the need for the scheme being identified and the general election. I cannot account for what Ministers knew—or did not know—at the time because I am not privy to that information. I came to the Treasury only 18 months ago, and we have no dealt with the problem. The right hon. Gentleman knows that I cannot account for what Conservative Ministers did, because I am not allowed access to that information under civil service rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Financial Secretary's line of defence. I am trying, Mr. Maxton, to be my normal, moderate, careful and considerate self, and not to attack the hon. lady directly. I know how long it sometimes takes to get to the bottom of avoidance schemes. If there is a lesson to be learned, it is that Customs and Excise should have prodded and pushed Ministers a little harder to force them into action. I am glad, however, that action has now been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to probe—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am chided from a sedentary position by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). If the hon. Gentleman wants it, I could probe the Financial Secretary on many aspects of the order. He will know—he engaged in a similar probing exercise, for wholly legitimate reasons, when in Opposition—that it is quite easy so to do. I would ask, Mr. Maxton, that sedentary comments are not made that would urge me to examine every scintilla of detail of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question is whether there is a European dimension to the order, particularly if supplies of leased motor vehicles came from non-United Kingdom sources. Will the Financial Secretary say how the order impacts on such supplies of services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right and proper that we close tax loopholes. I look forward with baited breath to what the Financial Secretary has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.8 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is so nice to welcome back the right hon. Gentleman to finance debates, especially now that he is in opposition and we are in government. I shall deal with his more general points in my concluding remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I was not responsible for Customs and Excise between 1995 and May 1997, I hope that we will all agree that our civil servants and parliamentary draftsmen do their best to ensure that legislation is drafted to achieve the Government's objectives. With the best will in the world, and in the absence of a crystal ball to gaze into, people who want to avoid paying tax will be able to find the tiniest of cracks through which revenue can flow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked why, if I know which companies are guilty, I do not name and shame them. I do not want to give them free publicity, and I certainly do not want to encourage others to believe that they can do the same, and that the Government condone such action—we do not. As the right hon. Gentleman well knows, there is a difference between evasion and avoidance; in this case, a weakness in the legislation allowed something to happen that neither we nor the previous Government believed should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The right hon. Gentleman also asked why it has taken so long to introduce the order—a question that takes us back to the point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon about how secure Customs and Excise and its legal advisers felt about their ability to win the case. Once Customs and Excise made the challenge, the schemes were put on hold. It was subsequently subject to the legal process, which takes rather a long time. We believed—as, presumably, did the previous Government, who followed the same strategy—that we would win the case. However, as I said, it is impossible to draft legislation exactly in order to guarantee no avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also asked what Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue were doing to ensure that our legislation was as tightly drawn as possible. Under this Government—and, I assume, under the previous Government—all proposed legislation is scrutinised before it is presented to the House to ensure that we try to prevent avoidance and that anti-avoidance measures are attached. As he well knows, Finance Bills have become increasingly complex partly because of the increasing complexity of anti-avoidance measures attached to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also asked whether the Government were pursuing the problem sufficiently vigorously. I shall not go into great detail, because I know that you, Mr. Maxton, will call me to order if I do so. However, the Government's first Finance Bill, in July 1997, and our second one, which is still very much in our minds, especially in mine and in those of the hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon and for Maldon and East Chelmsford, contain a huge battery of anti-avoidance measures. The Government have pursued the problem aggressively, and considerable revenue has been protected. I shall return at the end of my remarks to the right hon. Gentleman's point about general anti-avoidance regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford accused us of shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted, and asked, as did the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, why we were protecting £20 million for previously dated schemes. The leasing schemes were set up and pre-paid, but were not activated. The abuse could continue for another three to seven years because of that mechanism. The hon. Gentleman asked how income would be protected in future and the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked whether apportionment was necessary. Apportionment is unnecessary because the time at which invoices are issued or payments are made establish the time when VAT becomes due. That is clear, even in pre-paid schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So is the Financial Secretary making it clear that only payment dates or invoices due on or after 13 November 1998 are caught by this anti-avoidance order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I thought that I had made that clear. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's summary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked about the press notice issued on 13 November 1998, which sanctions that date. It is usual with anti-avoidance measures to state the intended date from when they will be applied by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members asked about the European dimension. It is early days in the negotiations and a result is not imminent, despite the frenzy in the press. The Government are concerned about a number of aspects, not least the potential revenue cost and the complexity of the proposals. Those concerns are shared by other member states and discussions continue. Nevertheless, we are prepared, as were the previous Government, to examine constructively any opportunities for change if that would benefit the United Kingdom. A consultation exercise is taking place with businesses to inform them of the United Kingdom's negotiating position. It will be completed on 11 December and has been useful, particularly to the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that we could change to the German system to which my reply is, "No, thank you, we are not planning to do that." It has become clear from consultation with businesses that they prefer a straight block to keeping records of private use and we believe that that is the right way to proceed. I understand that there are problems with the German scheme, which is often challenged in the European Court of Justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter arising from the hon. Gentleman's suggestion is the complexity of the scheme, not just for private business but for Government. The complex scheme would require a lot of record keeping and would make us vulnerable to what is politely called leakage—that is, loss of revenue because it is not collected. It is estimated that if we moved to such a scheme as much as £1 billion a year could be at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked about legal advice and why we were so sure that we could defend our case. Legal advice to us was that a purposive interpretation of the order is correct and that Customs and Excise would win. The High Court agreed. Unfortunately, the Court of Appeal ruled against Customs and Excise on a technical, literal interpretation, which reflects the constant pressure and pull between purpose and literal interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about Motability. Nothing in the order deals with Motability which remains unchanged. Despite this morning's wide-ranging debate, the order introduces a tiny change to protect a lot of money. I cannot say how much has been lost. The anti-avoidance scheme was challenged as soon as it started and it was put on hold. If we do not stop avoidance and if we do not say that we will not allow it to happen, people will take advantage. The estimate that £20 million of revenue is at risk is based on that premise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary write to members of the Committee to explain the rough estimate of the amount of revenue that has been lost? That would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to try to do that, but I am not sure that I will be able to help. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that the cost of pursuing information that may not be easily accessible in the VAT system might be disproportionate. I am not trying to prevent the hon. Gentleman from having information and I shall certainly make best endeavours to provide it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I was asked whether leases from overseas would be affected. None are included in the scheme, so there is no issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for a general anti-avoidance regulation, I must tell the right hon. Member for Fylde that we are consulting on that matter. The Inland Revenue has issued a document specifically on corporate tax which considers whether a general anti-avoidance regulation would be desirable. He knows that there are strong arguments for and against that. We must ensure that we are able to defend our tax system without putting extra burdens on business. Obviously we have to ensure that the system runs smoothly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Customs and Excise, we are working on a consultation document that is restricted to VAT only. We need to know whether anti-avoidance regulations will encourage businesses not to engage in the creative attack on the tax system that results in a loss of revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered all the questions, especially those on future supply. I hope that hon. Members have found the debate interesting and that they understand why the Government are acting on this small measure. I look forward to the next Finance Bill when the Government will continue to implement their strong policy to introduce measures to prevent tax avoidance and when I will no doubt have engaging discussions with Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong unduly the Committee's proceedings, but I have one or two further questions. I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for what she said about the mission proposals—these are obviously early days—and I accept what she said about the German system and the alternative way of approaching the problem, despite her original suggestion a few years ago. However, she said that the scheme might have a few years to run. Will she say a bit more about the primary and secondary period of a lease, which both the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon and I mentioned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear whether it is possible under the schemes to supply a new vehicle according to the original terms of the lease, or whether the schemes are restricted to the original vehicle. If they are restricted to the original vehicle, I do not understand how the figure of £20 million was reached. I am also puzzled as to how Customs and Excise can produce a figure for the amount of revenue that it believes might be lost if the scheme were to continue, if it cannot produce a figure as to how much revenue has already been lost as a result of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I answered the hon. Gentleman's question about the setting-up of the leasing schemes: they were pre-paid but not activated, and could be used over the next three to seven years. I also explained how we established when VAT became due: it is quite straightforward. The hon. Gentleman can be assured that the Govt will address the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members continue to ask me how much revenue has already been lost. When the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon pressed me to write to members of the Committee with a figure, I said that I would do so; I do not want to waste the Committee's time now. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
amount lost has not been significant so far, and our concern is the potential loss in future. I did not expect Opposition Members to want to know the pounds, shillings and pence, but I am happy to try to give such a reply, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, in a letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary said that a number of leases are pre-paid but not activated. Can she tell us the exact figure, which could presumably be used to give us the figure of £20 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we calculate the figures, we do so on the basis of what risk we believe such schemes pose to the tax system. Clearly, his party used the same method when it was in government, which makes it odd that Conservative Members should want chapter and verse on every issue. The hon. Gentleman's point was covered by the answer that I gave the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. As the right hon. Member for Fylde will know, if the revenue loss is under £5 million, that is the figure the Government will use. We are considering output tax in respect of the cars covered by the scheme. I have said that I shall try to respond to those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether it will be possible to supply new vehicles under an original lease, the answer is yes; that is the problem. As to whether it will be possible to start a new pre-paid lease when the car has not been supplied, the period of the lease would not start until the car was
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
supplied. Hon. Gentlemen can have fun discussing leases that are not activated and the relation between leases and new cars all morning if they like, but it seems to me that a little common sense would go a long way. Their questions related to a very small matter in regard to a tiny loophole, and they have probably exhausted the number of questions that they can ask on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is never possible to exhaust all the questions that could be asked. I shall try to be helpful, Mr. Maxton. Will the Financial Secretary give the Committee some indication of the total value of the VAT-able supplies and the VAT at issue? Our appreciation of the risk to VAT revenue is hampered because we do not know the VAT that is currently paid or the size of the VAT-able business that is the subject of the order. I appreciate that the Financial Secretary may not have such information instantly available, but perhaps she might supply it in due course so that we may sleep easy in our beds over the next few nights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to the parliamentary question from the right hon. gentleman on that issue. I would have been happy to have answered it before this Committee, if he had given me notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
