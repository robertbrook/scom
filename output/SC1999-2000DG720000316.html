	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Official Listing of Securities (Change of Competent Authority) Regulations 2000.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the regulations is to transfer the function of the United Kingdom competent authority for listing from the London stock exchange to the Financial Services Authority. The intention is that the transfer should take effect on 1 May 2000. The competent authority for listing performs a number of functions. It is responsible for making the listing rules that govern the admission of securities to the official list and the on-going responsibilities of issuers of such securities. It admits securities to the official list and monitors the on-going compliance by issuers of officially listed securities with the requirements laid down in the listing rules. Finally, it has a role in approving prospectuses and similar shareholder documents in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to have a competent authority is, like a number of the requirements that issuers of officially listed securities must meet, laid down in the various European Community directives dealing with official listing. There is no legal obligation on issuers of securities to apply for listing, but it acts as a kind of kite-mark. Investors know that securities admitted to official listing are obliged to meet and continue to fulfil the conditions set out in the listing rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London stock exchange has been the UK's competent authority since the concept was first introduced into UK law in 1984. It has performed the role of competent authority well and, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said when announcing our decision to make the transfer, we pay tribute to the exchange and to the staff of its listing department for the way in which they have carried out their responsibilities in that area. The decision to make the transfer in no way reflects dissatisfaction with the past performance of the exchange. However, as hon. Members will know, the exchange announced last year its proposal to demutualise—indeed, our debate today is topical because as Members of the Committee may know from media reports, the, exchange held its extraordinary general meeting yesterday and voted in favour of demutualisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those developments, it is no longer appropriate for the exchange to continue to exercise the competent authority function—indeed the exchange itself suggested that would be inappropriate. A demutualised stock exchange will be a for-profit organisation and we consider that a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
conflict of interest may be created if the statutory functions of the competent authority were exercised by a commercial for-profit company, especially against the background of increasing competition between stock exchanges, including new entrants to the UK market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore announced in October that we intended to transfer the competent authority function to the Financial Services Authority. Having the financial services regulator perform that role is in line with the practice in a number of other countries, including France, Spain, the United States and Japan. There are useful synergies in doing so: the FSA has a strong, wide-ranging interest in many different aspects of the markets in officially listed investments and is very concerned to ensure that such markets are not abused and that investors are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Bill in another place to adapt the proposed new framework for listing under that Bill in the light of the intended transfer of responsibilities. However, we have decided to effect the transfer initially by means of regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972. There are two main reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it is clearly in the interests of all concerned that the transfer of responsibilities be as smooth and seamless as possible. The transfer involves not just legislative powers, but staff, IT systems, financial issues, and so on. In that context, it is necessary to have a precise target date for making the transfer so that the planning and implementation can be carried out efficiently and effectively. As always with primary legislation, we cannot say precisely when the Financial Services and Markets Bill will be enacted and the necessary provisions brought into force; using regulations therefore enables us to specify in advance a particular date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, against the backdrop of the demutualisation process of the London stock exchange, it is desirable to make the transfer as soon as possible. It would be unsatisfactory for the exchange, as well as for others, to leave it with the competent authority function for a significant period after it has demutualised. There are also good practical reasons why it is better not to have too long a gap between announcing the decision to make the transfer and bringing it into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hence, we consider that it would be best to make the transfer using the powers under the European Communities Act 1972, and 1 May is the earliest feasible date. The proposed new framework for the competent authority in the Financial Services and Markets Bill would then be brought into effect as soon as possible after its enactment. The regulations provide for the transfer of the powers and responsibilities that are exercised by current competent authority. The exchange will, of course, retain its rights and duties as a recognised investment exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the regulations will be that the FSA will inherit the functions, rights and obligations of the exchange in its capacity as the competent authority. The regulations also make transitional provisions for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
listings and listing rules and anything done or in train at, the time of the transfer. Provision is included for the transfer of staff in the exchange's listing department to the FSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one regulation to which I draw specific attention. Although the transfer is intended to take place on 1 May, regulation 8 provides that the FSA should be able to make listing rules as soon as the regulations, when agreed by both Houses, are made. The purpose of that provision is to enable the FSA to bring the new listing rules and the revocations of the old listing rules into force immediately on 1 May when the transfer of functions takes effect. Certain limited changes to the listing rules are necessary to reflect the separation of admission to the official list and to trading on the London stock exchange after the FSA becomes the competent authority. In the absence of regulation 8, there might be doubt about the FSA's powers to prepare new rules in advance and an undesirable hiatus between the transfer of functions and the new listing rules taking effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exchange, the FSA and my Department are all working to ensure that the transfer occurs as smoothly as possible, with no loss of effectiveness for the competent authority. The draft regulations are a necessary part of the process and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.39 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statutory instrument changes the competent authority for the listing of securities from the London stock exchange to the FSA. I understand that the target date is 1 May. The role of listing securities includes the competence to admit securities to the official list to trade and list on the stock exchange under the terms and rules of the listing. The FSA will also be permitted to make its own rules in advance of the transfer. We understand that the staff in the exchange listing department will transfer to the FSA to provide such arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the transfer is the demutualisation of the London stock exchange. We could debate whether that rendered it inappropriate to continue such a role, but Conservative Members broadly accept that there is no alternative other than the FSA to take it on. The Government have advised that they will be tabling amendments to part IV of the Financial Services and Markets Bill in the other place in order to adopt a new legislative framework for listing in the light of the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the issue was discussed in Committee, several important and potentially controversial issues were raised, in particular by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). We seek specific responses from the Economic Secretary on the transfer, which is a proper function of our agreeing to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, if any, material changes to the stock exchange listing rules are proposed? The Financial Services and Markets Bill introduces a new power to accompany the transfer that will allow the FSA to impose a penalty on issuers who breach the listing rules. What is the intended magnitude of such
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
penalties, and what appeal procedure will operate when the FSA takes over the listing authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Services and Markets Bill also empowers the Treasury to change the FSA as the competent authority. In what circumstances would it effect that power? What would constitute the FSA not carrying out its duty as the listing authority satisfactorily?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that the generation of income is the major difference between the FSA's roles as regulator and listing authority. The listing role is about ensuring that companies provide the necessary information to the market. It is not about the conduct of business of issuers, which falls under the regulatory role of the FSA. Does the Minister feel it appropriate for the FSA's annual report and its annual general meeting, for example, to cover the listing function, as is proposed? Would it not be more appropriate for it to be dealt with separately, as it is a separate function? Indeed, it is likely to be lost when wrapped up in the FSA's main activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note that the proposed complaints investigator will be able to consider complaints against the competent authority—the FSA in its listing activities. We would like to be clear as to whether the complaints investigator's functions will include the power to make ex gratia payments when he feels that the listings authority has damaged the interests of certain companies. That touches the crucial issue of whether it is appropriate for the FSA to enjoy legal immunity in discharging its essentially commercial role as a listing authority. I shall return to that anon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What arrangements are proposed for the FSA to consult on rules and conduct cost-benefit analysis during its listing authority tasks? Is it proposed that cost-benefit analysis will apply only to changes that the FSA makes, or will such analysis be applied thoroughly to the whole system? The Committee will be aware that it is proposed that the regulatory tasks be grandfathered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The function of listing on the stock exchange has made a profit of about £4 million or £5 million a year, which is around a fifth of the turnover. The Government have advised that the transfer of functions should not result in a significant increase in costs to issuers, and the FSA has said that it believes that listing fees will not be materially different this year. Surely costs should go not up, as is implied, but down. If not, what is the FSA intending to do with the profit that it is likely to make from its listing activity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to penalties levied by the FSA? Will they be put towards reducing future listing charges, or will they be rebated in some way? There are arrangements for penalties in the FSA's other activities, but it is not clear what will happen to the penalties under its role as a listing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the FSA's role as the listing authority compare with other international listing authorities? As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has said previously, the Securities and Exchange Commission has five separate divisions. It is self-evident that the listing role will be a separate division, but precisely how, in terms of Chinese walls
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
and accountability, is it proposed that the FSA will structure that differently from its wider roles? The stock exchange also had the Securities and Investments Board as its regulator in a commercial role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA will have no regulator in acting as the listing authority. How will the discharge of its duty in accordance with requirements be monitored, if not regulated? That will make legal immunity ever more relevant, in that if the FSA were immune from acting with gross negligence in such activity, and it has no regulator monitoring it, clearly there will be some risk of it not discharging its role satisfactorily. I cannot resist making the point that, in the private sector, those who mis-sold pensions have suffered greatly, while, in the public sector, that has not been so. No one seems even to known who in the Department of Social Security was responsible for mis-advice on the state earnings-related pension scheme widows' pensions. When matters are locked in and unaccountable, there is clearly scope for things to go seriously wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will have responsibility for maintaining market liquidity? The listing authority has played that crucial role. It would be inappropriate for the FSA to provide such a service, but how is it envisaged that it will continue under the new listing arrangements? More important are the potential conflicts of interest. The FSA will be regulating corporate financiers, producing documents on the basis of which companies are listed, but then, wearing its listing authority hat, it might decline approval for such a listing. Having already approved such individuals as fit and proper, it might say that what they are doing is not so. How will conflicts of interest be resolved when carrying out both roles?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing has been said about AIM—the alternative investments market—which is an important, but vulnerable market in the present climate. That will be left with the stock exchange, so the exchange will carry on a listing authority duty after all, with a main market. On one hand, that implies that the stock exchange could continue as the listing authority; on the other, if that is considered inappropriate, why should the stock exchange continue to handle the listing authority role for AIM? Next year, we will face considerable dangers of crashes in prices in AIM, in which values will be driven up to excessive levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will handle closing prices? Many unit trusts rely for their valuation purposes on the closing prices that the stock exchange has previously produced as the listing authority. As far as I am aware, the FSA will not be handling closing prices. Will the stock exchange continue that as a separate role, although it will no longer be the listing authority? During proceedings in Committee on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, I said that we shared the view of the Confederation of British Industry that, in its commercial role as the listing authority, it was particularly inappropriate for the FSA to be immune from being sued for gross negligence. It will be carrying out a different role from that of its regulatory role. It will have the responsibility for checking prospectuses—or will it
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
have to delegate that to someone else? What are the Government's specific proposals? Do they intend the same immunity that is enjoyed generally under the Financial Services and Markets Bill by the complaints investigator, or do they propose that, in the listing authority role, the FSA should have less immunity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are worried that the FSA will have too much of a monopoly on determining, under the Treasury's direction, whether companies that want to list can do so. What arrangements have been considered for a degree of independent adjudication and appeal? The Treasury is to decide what category of assets is competent for listing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this territory, I am certainly not a member of the stock exchange, but as the chairman of a management business, I should perhaps declare an interest. The listing of funds on the stock exchange has international importance governing the marketability of British funds elsewhere in the world. For example, the structure of the umbrella fund was developed by the legal innovation of the stock exchange and firms of City lawyers, which worked out that if a fund added new share classes, they could be deemed to be already listed. I am somewhat concerned that is an area of commercial innovation and that the Treasury may not appreciate the importance of subtlety and flexibility in determining which categories of assets should be listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government proposing parallel-warning notice mechanisms in relation to penalties for breaches of listing requirements, as provided for other offences under the Financial Services and Markets Bill, or will there be different arrangements? Will the FSA take six months, as prescribed, to make up its mind whether to grant a listing, or up to a year if it gives notice that it is to require further consideration? Do the Government believe that six to 12 months provide a speedy enough process? Would it not be better for the FSA to accomplish decisions more speedily?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the FSA act regarding the suspension of listings? Usually, they are suspended by the stock exchange in the event of volatile share movements or financial irregularities. I am worried that in the present climate, with the FSA taking on this role anew, and even though the listing department staff will transfer, there are distinct risks that the FSA could damage its reputation in the event of a United States-led crash in share prices. Many people would argue that is a distinct probability—or, at least, a possibility—at some time over the next year. If the FSA acted incompetently in such territory, it could damage its entire reputation as a regulator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Conservative party asked Howard Davies about a year ago whether the FSA had any intention or desire to become the listing authority, he categorically denied it. He asserted that the FSA "had no desire" to do so. I am worried that the role is being forced on the FSA, potentially against its better judgment. Today could see a change in the arrangements for takeovers, if the Government agree to the proposed EU directive. That, together with less flexible listing arrangements, could be bad news for London and bad news for the financial services industry. Success has depended on flexibility, open markets and rules that were not cast in stone. This very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
day could be a bad day for the future of the financial services industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The act of transfer raises a host of questions. The Government have said that they will deal with it through amendments in the Lords. I should be grateful if the Minister made some effort to respond to the issues that I have raised. I should like an assurance that the matter will be addressed in the manner that we suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fallon 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sevenoaks)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) on two or three points. The first is market liquidity. I am not sure how the responsibility for market liquidity is transferred. Perhaps the Minister could assist us on that. Liquidity has been a persistent problem, particularly for the junior market, and it is one that the Government recognised when they came to office. There was a Treasury working group under the former Paymaster General and there was a lot of talk, but I am not sure what resulted. What responsibilities will the Financial Services Authority have for liquidity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question concerns the regulatory news services. When the chairman of the FSA appeared before the Treasury Committee—the Minister will not yet have seen the transcript from Tuesday—he said that the FSA was looking at the way in which the news services would be conducted. I think that he said that it would consult practitioners. A monopoly is involved, and I should be grateful to hear the Treasury's view on the matter. Does it believe that there is a case for breaking up the monopoly and allowing a wider range of regulatory news services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and final issue that I want to raise is costs. We have established that the FSA's costs for the year beginning 1 April, which will comprise the change that the Minister is introducing, will be 5.5 per cent. higher than the outturn that it expects in the current financial year 1999–2000. What impact does the Minister expect that change will have on the FSA's costs? I assume that it will be beneficial. The activity is reasonably profitable and should therefore lead to some reduction in costs, even though the staff have to be transferred. I should be grateful if the Minister addressed those three points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by declaring my interest as a director of a firm that is a member of the stock exchange. I echo some of the points that were comprehensively laid out by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. He referred to me a couple of times, and I should explain that he was referring to the debate on the Financial Services and Markets Bill in Standing Committee on 28 October 1999, which was some five months ago—although, with the Minister in front of us again, it seems like only yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over those five months, little has moved on. We discussed the pertinent clauses—clauses 72 to 82—the day after the Minister's announcement that the stock exchange was to lose its function as the competent
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
authority was trailed in the press. She prefaced her remarks then with an explanation, which was useful, but some serious thinking on the hoof was required. Understandably, we did not get sufficient answers to the many questions that arose—many of which have been repeated by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. Five months on, those questions still remain unanswered. Little, if any, additional information on the competent authority clauses was forthcoming on Report. When will we get the answers? I should like to pose some of the questions again to see whether they have been properly addressed or whether we may be given an undertaking that they will be properly addressed now that the Bill is in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important point, which was not properly explained at the time, is who polices the FSA in its role as the competent authority. We debated the FSA's extensive policing powers long into the night, but the regulators obviously policed the stock exchange in its role as the competent listing authority. The FSA will be the competent authority, which is a profitable business, and the regulator. How can we be sure that the FSA's regulatory wing properly oversees its competent authority wing across a Chinese wall or whatever division may be put up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs rightly said, being the listings authority is a profitable business. The last stock exchange report and accounts show that the turnover from the listing authority role amounted to £29.3 million, a fifth of the stock exchange's annual turnover. If the FSA sets the rules for the competent authority listing particulars, the obvious incentive will be to reduce the threshold that companies have to cross to become viable for listing because that will increase listing revenues. The Minister has not yet addressed that obvious conflict of interest to our satisfaction. The incentive will be to list companies that are perhaps insufficiently prepared or of insufficient calibre to achieve a listing, and the investors in companies that do not quite come up to scratch will ultimately lose out. The FSA was intended to ensure that investors are protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that Parliament would certainly be one of the authorities that would take an interest if such a dilution of standards took place? Surely he is not suggesting that Parliament could not fulfil that function adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. The FSA's accountability to various panels, tribunals and, ultimately, the Treasury, as well as the other checks and balances, were all part of our discussions. We considered whether the FSA should be accountable, on an annual report basis, to the Treasury Committee or other bodies in the House. We understand how such accountability could work, but we do not know how it will work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stock exchange has acted as the competent listing authority for about 2,600 companies, so there is absolutely no chance that the Minister, members of the Treasury Committee or other interested Members could monitor the listing competence standards.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Perhaps we should ultimately take responsibility for such matters, but that will not happen in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The self-regulatory organisations that oversee the stock exchange, which are coming together to form the FSA, as well as the various consumer organisations, provide the checks and balances and ensure that standards are kept. However, it will be difficult for an outsider to check whether the standards are properly monitored and maintained when those functions are the responsibility of the same office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McWalter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are improving the capacity of individuals to whistleblow. If the standards that one would expect of such an authority were gently or swiftly eroded, that mechanism would provide an entrée to solving some of those difficulties and the Treasury Committee could act on any instance of whistleblowing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is a slightly rose-tinted view because the FSA is short of people. There is a huge problem with recruitment; people involved in regulation compliance in the City can almost name their price. The FSA finds it hard to compete with market companies that can pay the going rate. It has to offer bonuses and, in some cases, bounty money to retain and recruit staff, so I am not sure that the potential for whistleblowing exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more important point is that as part of the transfer of the competent authority regulations—against which we firmly argued at Committee stage—if the FSA does not process an application for listing within six months of it being made, that application will be deemed to have failed. If a company—a dot.com company, for example—legitimately applied for listing to enable it to raise money to finance expansion, for example, and, through the sheer incompetence of the listing authority personnel or the system, its application had not been properly processed by the expiry of the six-month period, that company would be told: "Sorry, your application has failed." That could affect and undermine the company's entire future. Those incompetent people are unlikely to whistleblow on themselves. Although I take the reasonable point of the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter), the potential for whistleblowing on a lowering of standards is not great.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening closely to the hon. Gentleman's argument. Will he enlighten me—I do not pretend to be an expert on such matters—about whether, if the prime role of the FSA is to regulate the financial markets, a secondary desire to raise money from the listing activities would create the conflict of interest to which he referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The authority will have two competing roles: first, to regulate financial services, ensuring that they are up to scratch, and the markets—I dispute the Minister's assertion that it has no role in maintaining liquidity within markets, although I do not know whether the view on that has changed. However, the same organisation, with the same budget, will also undertake what is essentially a
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
market role: to maintain a competent listing authority, for which money changes hands. In the scenarios that I set out there is an obvious potential conflict of interest that the Minister has not resolved. The FSA would certainly benefit financially. I do not know how many new companies come on to the market each year, but say 200 came this year and 400 next year. That would represent a doubling of the listing revenue that would go directly into the FSA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's last comments go to the heart of my point. Surely the FSA will be judged by not the profits it makes but how well it regulates the financial markets. If, in order to gain capital, it allows unsuitable companies to come on to the market and that causes problems, the FSA will be seen to have failed in its primary purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. The problem is who monitors whether the authority succeeds or fails in terms of the quality of the companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point, on where the money goes, answers that question to some extent. It is an issue about which we thought long and hard and which my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned: what will happen to the revenue from listing and from penalties? As part of its status as competent authority, the FSA will have the ability to impose penalties on listed firms if they do not abide by the regulations to maintain their listing. In our discussions on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, it was not made clear whether that budget would be ring-fenced in relation to the competent authority role or whether it could be used to offset or subsidise other functions within the FSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one of the FSA's regulatory functions was found wanting, in need of greater resources or more personnel or offering greater bonuses to attract personnel, the fifth floor or wherever the competent authority department is based could be used as a good source of revenue that could be offset against another department. That is how dangers arise and why we want safeguards, which do not yet exist, on how budgets in different departments, in strict contrast with the regulatory function, will be held. That matter marks a strict contrast with the regulatory function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will additional moneys be rebated to members licensed to do business by the FSA? Will they go towards paying tribunal costs, defraying the FSA's legal costs or financing other activities? We have not received answers to such questions. The matter concerns listing money that will more than pay for the personnel—a huge number of personnel is not currently involved at the stock exchange. There will be a profit if the body is run on the same lines as the stock exchange. In addition, there is a penalty income from fines imposed on companies that do not maintain their listing requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 28 October, when the Financial Services and Markets Bill was in Committee, I asked the Minister what happens to companies that take issue with penalties that are imposed on them. She replied that the route for challenging the penalty imposed by the competent authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>is by a reference to the tribunal.—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 28 October 1999; c. 607.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister gave a clear undertaking to table further amendments to the Bill to clarify that. I might have missed those amendments, but will she clarify why they have not yet been tabled? Now that further aspects of the tribunal's workings have been clarified, will the Minister table amendments as the Bill goes through another place? If not, why not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three more points. What happens when the FSA fails to live up to its requirements as a competent authority? There has been a move from a demutualised stock exchange to the FSA, the regulatory authority. If the FSA is found wanting in carrying out its role as the competent authority, where is one to go? No one, apart from the Minister, the Treasury and perhaps the House, is above the FSA, which is one of the most powerful organisations in the land headed by an extremely powerful individual. What is the procedure for determining that the FSA should no longer retain its role as the competent authority, and to whom is it likely to be passed if that day ever comes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned, in a rather blasé fashion, that the Government do not intend to do anything different from what happens in Germany, France or the United States. There are clear differences with the United States, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, and with France. During the Committee's deliberations, I said that such roles are split between the Commission des Operations de Bourses and the Conseil des Marchés Financières. That was another issue on which I did not receive a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another fundamental difference, relevant to my earlier point, is that there are set levels for penalties that have a set link with any profits that might have been made from abuse of the system. Those fines go back to the Treasury, so there is no conflict of interest if the FSA milks one of its operations to subsidise another; the money will go back to the Treasury. That is clearly different from the way in which the FSA is financed, which is particularly pertinent to the way in which the listing revenues come in. We have asked the Economic Secretary to revisit the matter but, again, she rode roughshod over that request, saying that that is what happened in three other countries. It is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point has already been made well by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. Why on earth is the stock exchange retaining its role as the equivalent of the competent authority for the listing of alternative investments market stocks? It is arguably the fastest growing and the riskiest part of the market, where the ordinary consumer stands to lose the most if standards are not properly maintained. We did not receive a proper explanation of why it is perfectly legitimate that the stock exchange, having demutualised, should lose its role as the competent authority for listed stocks while retaining a powerful role in the controlling of market of AIM stocks. Will the Economic Secretary deal with that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that Opposition Members seem to be suffering from the recent lack of opportunity to discuss the Financial Services and Markets Bill. Those who were members of Standing Committee A are missing it so much that they are showing every sign of wanting to return to the same territory. I shall answer their questions, but I remind them gently that the order is about the transfer arrangements, not an opportunity for a further debate on a Bill that is now in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it is, Mr. Jones. You are right. I just wanted to say how much I noted the enthusiasm of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for how the listing rules will be transferred, the changes have not been published for consultation, but it is expected, for example, that there will be a requirement that those issuers officially listing securities must be admitted to trading. It is intended that there should be no significant changes, but some will arise due to the transfer of the function. Basically, the pattern of the proposal is that there should be a transfer across into the new arrangements for the existing rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments ensure that the new arrangements will be the subject to the same consultation requirements—including a costs-benefit analysis—as other FSA rules. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked who will police the Financial Services Authority. The Treasury will continue to oversee the competent authority when the FSA is that authority. It will agree the competent authority's objectives annually and hold regular meetings to assess progress. There will be general objectives to ensure that the listing rules continue to meet United Kingdom obligations under European Community law. There will be policy objectives: for example, one of this year's objectives was to prepare for consultation suggestions for changes arising from the current market research into the views of smaller companies. There are operational objectives, for example, on the timetable for processing applications for listing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given our intention that the competent authority's function should be carried out in broadly the same way as it is now and given the Treasury oversight role, we see no need to set out objectives in the Bill for the FSA as the competent authority any more that we would do if the stock exchange were to remain the competent authority. It will be exactly parallel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McWalter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend take up the question raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, who suggested that the Treasury would need to have detailed knowledge of 2,600 listed companies? If the criteria were softened so that 3,000 or 3,500 companies were eased into the listing, does she agree that that would show up statistically, and that the Treasury would pick up any such dilution of standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The Treasury never subscribes to dilution of standards under any circumstances. We intend to apply several principles to the competent authority along the lines of those in clause 2(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which is familiar to some Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The six-month delay comes from the directives, as a couple of Opposition Members mentioned. The average turnaround is now three months. The operational objectives and the statutory principles in amendments tabled in another place will work to prevent such delays. Once the application is deemed to be refused after six months, there is the right to refer to a tribunal, as I think we debated in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of conflict of interest, the FSA will be subject to the requirements of the directives, the principles of the Bill and the supervision of the Treasury. If it does not do a proper job as a competent authority, the power to transfer the function will apply. The transparency for budget setting will be the same as for the FSA. The competent authority will consult on the fees for listing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will of course be a Chinese wall between the competent authority and the bulk of the FSA. Information will be able to pass through various gateways, but only in certain circumstances. Regulations setting out the nature and scope of the gateways will be laid in due course under the powers contained in the Financial Services and Markets Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to keep the power to transfer the function. The precise wording of the grounds for a transfer under schedule 7 will be changed but will largely cover the same ground as the wording in the Bill, which would transfer the power if the FSA did not do a satisfactory job. We shall also retain the wide public interest ground. Any decision to transfer would be subject to affirmative resolution of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA will retain the current listing rules. For example, changes that might be made to affect the division between admission to the official list and admission to trading on the London stock exchange have not been published for consultation. It is expected that an issuer's officially listed securities must be admitted to trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments make it clear that the FSA may, as a listing authority, only set fees that enable it to meet its expenses in carrying out its functions, and to retain reserves and cover the past expenses of those functions. There is no question of the functions enabling the FSA to make a profit. I want to make that clear, as several hon. Members have expressed significant concern about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see no reason to separate the competent authority function. It is important that the FSA regularly reports on the functions in annual meetings and annual reports. I think that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised that subject in his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations clearly do not affect the daily official list, which is published by the stock exchange
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
and gives closing prices. The stock exchange will continue to publish that useful tool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any recognised stock exchange can admit securities for trading, provided that they meet the recognition requirements for proper and orderly markets. The alternative investments market has nothing to do with official listing. It is a creation of the stock exchange, so there is no reason for it not to continue. The situation is different from that suggested by several Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The competent authority function is concerned with admission to the official list, not with market liquidity per se. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was right to say that I made that remark before. I confirm that we have not changed our views. Market liquidity is a matter for the markets and it is important that the competent authority carries out the functions flexibly and appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Bill set a statutory requirement that, in discharging its general functions, the competent authority must have regard to several factors—including the need to use its resources in the most efficient and economic way, the principle that the burden or restriction imposed on a person should be proportionate to the benefits, the desirability of facilitating innovation in respect of listed securities, the international character of capital markets, the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom, the need to minimise the adverse effects on competition of anything done in the discharge of these functions and, finally, the desirability of facilitating competition in relation to listed securities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked which investments would be excluded by the Treasury under the Bill. It is impossible to say now exactly what investments would be excluded, but it is likely to be those for which it is difficult to supply price information to investors, such as insurance contracts. The reason for the power is that admission for all securities will be placed on a statutory footing. It is right that the Treasury has the reserve power to set the boundaries of what can be admitted to listing, but we do not anticipate having to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA is aware of concerns about increases in fees and stated that it would ensure that the fees remained competitive. It will be conscious of the cost of operating the competent authority while at the same time ensuring that the competent authority is sufficiently staffed to maintain the high standards of performance that the market expects. It will have to consult on proposed fees, as it does on its own fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to the moneys collected as penalties? A new clause after clause 95 in the Financial Services and Markets Bill provides that the competent authority must not seek to recover costs when imposing financial penalties. It also provides that it must operate a scheme to redistribute moneys received from financial penalties. It must consult on the scheme and have regard to representations. The provisions are analogous to those applied to the authority more generally under paragraph 16 of schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) referred to the future of the regulatory news service, which will remain with the London stock exchange. It is envisaged that for the time being the RNS will remain the primary method of disseminating price-sensitive information. I made several announcements about that in Committee. I asked the FSA to undertake a review of the arrangements for the dissemination of price-sensitive information by listed companies and to propose amendments to the current listing rules' requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA will launch a consultation exercise with interested parties to devise alternative arrangements. The FSA also intends to move towards electronic filing of documentation and to set up a central database of all the information filed, possibly with links back to listed companies. Such a system could be similar to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system operated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. No timetable for such a system has yet been set by the FSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked about penalties. The amount of the penalty will depend on the seriousness of the breach. A breach of the listing rules can be a simple technical breach or something much more serious, such as the misleading of shareholders in the markets. The competent authority and the FSA will be under an obligation to
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
consult and publish a policy statement on the imposition and amount of the penalties. The competent authority will also be under a duty to set up a scheme to remit penalty income to issuers in the same way as the FSA has to remit penalties to authorised persons. Like other competent authority decisions, decisions to impose financial penalties will be capable of being referred to the tribunal that will be established under the Bill. Breaches of listing rules will be covered by the same warning and decision notice procedures as elsewhere in the Bill. I know that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is familiar with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, let me deal with immunity. The regulations do not change the current immunity of the competent authority under the 1986 Act. For the competent authority to do an effective job, it is important that it does not run the risk of legal challenge at every turn. The arrangements under the Financial Services Act 1986 are being carried forward. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
