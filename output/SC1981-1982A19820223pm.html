	<i>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</i>.]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing amendment No. 27, in page 5, line 33, leave out from "is" to end of line 35 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"12 months on the first occasion that the offender has received a sentence of youth custody and 24 months for any subsequent sentence ".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percy Grieve 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire briefly to speak in opposition to the amendment to which the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) has put his name and in support of which he has spoken. In opposing I do not think I need say more than that the proposed amendments are contrary to one of the most important policies in the Bill, namely, to restore to the courts in dealing with children and young persons under 21 the discretion which for so long has been removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On many occasions hon. Members have testified to the problems which were created for the courts by the rule, of which I too have spoken in the Committee, that they could not impose prison sentences on persons under 21 of more than six months or less than three years, or six months and 18 months if such a young person had been to a borstal. So wedded is the hon. Member for York to this concept that he is seeking to reintroduce, in a slightly different form, the very same restrictions upon the discretion of the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman manifestly does not trust the courts to do that which is right, proper and just. For myself, I do, and believe that the generality of the population does, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the hon. Gentleman does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not the only person in the Committee who has exercised judicial office. The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons), and the hon. Member for York, have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
I should have thought that the hon. and learned Gentlemen on the Government side would have seen, as I have seen, over the years, the evil which flowed from this restriction upon the discretion of the courts. I am not saying that in every case the courts were inhibited. In many cases, of course, they would not have imposed more than six months or less than three years. But there was always the case in which the limited decision which the courts could make was a fetter upon the discretion of the courts in the exercise of their duty to do its best for the young offender and also to protect society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would bring all that back again, and it is not surprising that the hon. Member for York said that of his two amendments he preferred No. 27. Naturally he prefers amendment No. 27, because that goes much further in fettering the discretion of the courts than amendment No. 26. For myself, I would have none of them, for the reasons I indicated briefly to the Committee. I do not want to repeat arguments which we have already gone over in respect of other matters in the Bill. I oppose the amendments and invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to do so, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed to reduce the maximum sentences that can be imposed upon young offenders. In that sense they are not, as the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) would have us believe, totally fettering the judiciary. They are in no way taking away the discretion from the judiciary. All they are doing is limiting the parameters in which the judiciary may impose sentences upon offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament does that all the time, and Parliament does it in the legislation which affects the maximum sentences which may currently be imposed. Those maxima were set by Parliament, and hon. Members did not suggest then that this was an abuse of Executive power, or an intolerable interference in the rights of the judiciary. Parliament was then exercising what my hon. Friend now proposes should be exercised, its proper right to determine the minimum and maximum sentences that the courts should be enabled to impose, and to leave the courts discretion within that minima and maxima to determine what they consider the right and appropriate sentence for a particular offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the amendments are highly appropriate and relevant at a time when the Prison Department is having to use police cells in London in order to accommodate prisoners, due to the overcrowding at Brixton and Wormwood Scrubs prisons. The proposal is highly relevant when we have seen over the past six weeks the 2,300 phenomenal increase in the prison population, bringing it back to well over the 42,000 that was supposed to be the crisis figure alluded to by the former Home Secretary, Mr. Roy Jenkins, in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the amendment to reduce the maxima and therefore, it is hoped, to reduce the prison population, is highly relevant in view of the report received recently from the prison inspectorate in respect of the squalid, appalling conditions—its words, not mine—in Gloucester prison, and the threat of a riot at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
Pentonville unless what the prisoners refer to as dehumanising and brutalising conditions are improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who want to see a reduction in the prison population, who believe that a reduction can be achieved without in any way endangering the public, naturally welcome the amendments. Those of us who favour lower maximum penalties start from what I think is now the well-established proposition, shared by both sides of the House of Commons, that long sentences do not produce any tangible benefit in either preventing crime or preventing re-offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1977 the Advisory Council on the Penal System's interim report about the length of prison sentences stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we have come unanimously to the conclusion that a large number of sentences of imprisonment passed by the courts, especially in the short and medium term band of sentences, are longer than they need be, in the interests either of society or of the offender."</p></blockquote>
That was in paragraph 3 of the report. In 1979, the report of the May inquiry into the United Kingdom prison services quoted that statement by the advisory council, and went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have neither received nor have our inquiries disclosed any evidence that conflicts with this view. We are unanimous and emphatic in endorsing it".</p></blockquote>
That was in paragraph 3.64 of the May report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that the advisory council undertook an exhaustive and thorough review of the effects of custodial sentences on young offenders specifically for its report " Young Adult Offenders ", published in 1974. In that report the council concluded that, for offenders of comparable background, time spent in custody could not be shown to produce any better results than supervision of that offender in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar, indeed almost an identical conclusion, was reached by the Home Office in Research Study No. 35, " The Effectiveness of Sentencing", which analysed the results of a wide range of research studies from this country, the United States and other Western European countries, and summed up by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It can be concluded that there is no evidence that longer custodial sentences produce better results than shorter sentences.".</p></blockquote>
There already we have three eminently respectable, sensible, well-researched bodies or organisations, the advisory council, the May committee and the Home Office itself, all saying in quite clear and emphatic terms that shorter sentences are no less effective than longer sentences, that longer sentences are ineffective in terms of reducing recidivism or as acting as a general deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, on that particular point I accept that, when talking in terms of the sentences the courts may pass, it may be that they are affected by what they consider will be the deterrent effects of a sentence upon those who may be thinking about committing a similar offence; they may have in mind other potential offenders who they will deter by a
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
particularly punitive sentence from committing a particular crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, it is only fair to point out what the Advisory Council on the Penal System's interim report " The Length of Prison Sentences " had to say in 1977 on the point. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Evidence about the effectiveness of general deterrents, however, is regrettably scant. Research findings are difficult to interpret and are inconclusive; the subject is in any event difficult to investigate by normal research techniques. All one can say with any degree of confidence is that nothing is likely to be lost by a general reduction in the length of sentences in the case of those offenders with whom this report is concerned."</p></blockquote>
By that remark it was referring to non-dangerous offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some evidence, however, about whether punitive sentences have a deterrent effect. It is important to allude to evidence, because this is the argument that many people outside the House and certain hon. Gentlemen constantly adduce in favour of longer sentences. We will all acknowledge that the overwhelming evidence shows that longer sentences do not result in a lower rate of recidivism—that is common ground now amongst hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. Some hon. Members however, will probably advance the speculation that nevertheless longer sentences might be useful in deterring individuals from committing offences in the first place. As the advisory council's quotation which I have read indicates, that kind of research by its very nature is difficult to get hold of and is indeed scant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do have the conclusions of one very important and well-publicised study carried out by the Home Office research unit. You may remember, Mr. Dean, that in 1973 there was a widely-publicised case of a 20-year sentence being imposed on a 16-year-old boy mugger in Birmingham and 10-year sentences being imposed on his two accomplices. The results were followed up both in Birmingham and in six other urban centres by the Home Office research unit. The result was that there was no perceptible decrease in the number of robberies or assaults with intent in Birmingham or in the six other urban areas in the period after those widely-publicised and highly-punitive sentences were passed. Other studies both in this country and in the United States have indicated a similar conclusion, that the deterrent effect of punitive sentences has certainly not been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know, then, that longer sentences have not been shown to be more effective than shorter sentences in preventing re-offending nor in acting as a deterrent. Therefore the argument for shorter sentences, particularly if one takes into account also the high cost of imprisonment and the overcrowding of our prisons, becomes overwhelming. The argument now for shorter sentences is accepted by the Magistrates' Association, by the Justices Clerks' Society and indeed by the Government. The argument has been advanced most eloquently and most notably by the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor. We all agree that there should be shorter prison sentences; we disagree on the methods that should be employed to achieve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
The Government insist that they should be achieved by exhortation and consent, that they will use the voluntary approach, constantly educating and exhorting the judiciary to pass shorter sentences, or to rely upon cases such as Upton v. Bibi to set guidelines for the lower courts. The Government can claim, as I have acknowledged, that this has resulted in a small reduction in the lengths of prison sentences. It should be emphasised, however, that there was only a marginal reduction in prison sentences imposed in 1980 compared with those imposed in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, it is also only fair to point out that the effect of those shorter sentences imposed by the courts has been completely vitiated by the 4,000 additional custodial sentences passed in 1979 compared with 1980 and the fact, as I have already indicated, that the prison population has increased by 2,300 in the last six weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group proposed that legislation was essential if we were to see a significant reduction in the prison population. Like it or not, legislation is inescapable if we are to have any significant reduction in the present high level of people in custody. We need legislation, first, to produce an early release scheme and, secondly, to reduce, as my hon. Friend is attempting to do in these amendments, the maximum penalties that can be imposed by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advisory Council on the Penal System, in its report " Sentences of Imprisonment—A review of Maximum Penalties " in 1978, set out a scheme for a reduction in the maximum sentences that could be imposed and differentiated between exceptional and ordinary offenders. The Penal Affairs Group believes that the effect of the scheme of the advisory council, if introduced, would have only a marginal impact on the prison population. This is why we would rather go further and have a new maximum for ordinary offences fixed at a point below existing sentences in practice and have a maximum, which the advisory council did not suggest, for so-called exceptional offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Home Affairs has endorsed both the view of the advisory council and that of the Parliamentary all-party penal affairs group, signatories to the Select Committee's report on the prison service in 1981 included, amongst others the hon. Members for Paddington (Mr. Wheeler), Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight) and Reigate (Mr. Gardiner), of whom the latter two are certainly not regarded as liberal do-gooders—indeed, they are usually regarded as being on the hard right of the Tory Party. The hon. Members for Birmingham, Edgbaston and Reigate are rumoured to have been put on the Select Committee to look after the interests of the Right Wing of the Conservative Party, yet they put their names to that report and to this recommendation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Should the efforts now being made by the Home Secretary and other parties to change the direction of sentencing policy fail to bear fruit within a reasonably short time, we believe that Parliament should grasp the nettle and
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
further limit the maximum length of sentences by statutory means."</p></blockquote>
It went on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such legislation should now be prepared, in full consultation with interested parties, since we would not wish to see such a measure brought before Parliament as a hurried response to a heightening of the penal crisis."</p></blockquote>
That is a quote from paragraph 87.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress that legislation to reduce maximum penalties on the lines of that proposed by my hon. Friend in this amendment is not in itself an alternative to an early, supervised release of certain offenders, first, because the maximum penalties are not currently imposed anyway, so enacting new maxima would not in itself necessarily reduce the sentences actually imposed in practice nor reduce the prison population. Even if they did, the effect upon the prison population would take some considerable time to work through. There would be a considerable time lag between the imposition of any new maximum penalties and the effect on the prison population, whereas legislation for an early release scheme would have a substantial and immediate effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for the reasons that I have outlined, I believe that a reduction in maximum penalties both for young and adult offenders is desirable in its own right. Therefore I support these reasonable and sensible amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the irritation felt by the judiciary over the years about the fetter on discretion secured by section 3 of the 1961 Act, which provided that for persons between 17 and 21 one could sentence only up to six months or more than three years unless they had already had a period of borstal training, in which case it was up to six months and 18 months and above. It was felt to restrict judges when they thought the correct sentence for someone who had not been to borstal was two years. They could not impose that sentence and therefore they were thrown back to giving a sentence of borstal training when they would have preferred to have given two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect was to reduce the time that someone spent in prison or in custody because, although the period spent in borstal was open ended, the increasing pressure on borstal places meant that the convicted young person usually spent considerably less than 12 months in the borstal, whereas had he been given a two-year sentence, with one-third remission he would have been in custody for 16 months and, what is more, he would have been with older criminals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. and learned Gentleman given his mind to the situation which, although rare, nevertheless arose from time to time in the courts, of the young man who committed a really serious offence for which the court felt obliged to pass sentence of three years' imprisonment but might, for some reason, have wished to mitigate it by six months or so, and was unable to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding has always been that the court should not give more than it thought to be the proper sentence. I think that that situation happened seldom. If it did happen, there was not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
only remission but also the parole board as a second stop. I am not saying that it never happened. What I am saying is that on balance the real fed-upness of the judiciary was that it could not give more than it was empowered to give because of the restriction and therefore, because of that restriction, which is now being removed, people spent less time in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take another example. Where a young man has come out of borstal and offends again and he comes back before the Crown court, unless it is a serious matter the Crown court will say to a young man of 19, " Recall to borstal". That means six months in borstal. If there were no fetter on the judicial discretion, it would not say, " Recall to borstal "—meaning six months—but would say, " This man has already spent so many months in an institution. He has offended again. We will give him more". Looking at it from the number of months a person spends in custody, that would seem obvious for those who offend again after having come out of borstal instead of the usual sentence " Recall to borstal", which is all that the court can say in most cases, because unless the court says that the offence is worth 18 months or more for that borstal offender, it cannot send him to prison because six months or less is inadequate. That means that the young man spends six months on that borstal recall instead of spending longer in custody if, say, he were to receive a 12-month or a 15-month sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that by having the concept of youth custody without any restrictions one has to face the fact that whatever other advantages the new system has there will be more young people spending more time in custody than before. Therefore, I also go along with the view of the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) that, under the new system, a person who, having served six months' imprisonment, goes back again this time is given 12 or 18 months. Over the age of 21 he will then start off at a higher level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) has been a recorder for a number of years, as have I. But is it not true—and I ask him to consult his experience—that most courts regard borstal as something different from prison? When a young man becomes 21 and offends again, they do not say, " Ah, borstal; he served so many months, so we will start higher up the scale "; they start at a fairly low level for prison because it is regarded as different from borstal. It is regarded as a different regime, with different purposes and adult prisoners. Therefore the fact that a young man has been to borstal does not necessarily mean that when he offends at over the age of 21 the court starts with a high sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems obvious that if there is youth custody sentencing which is unfettered there will be a travelling upwards in sentence. If a man had 12 months as his last youth custody sentence, the first time he offends as an adult he will go to prison for two years or more, whereas under the old system the
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
first sentence might have been 12 months for that young man who is over 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the intentions of the Government, who have stated that they wish to keep sentences as short as possible, the effect of the clause will mean that more young people will spend more time in prison. Therefore, one must look at how one can put a restiction on it without fettering the judicial discretion in a silly way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have look at the two amendments proposed by the hon. Member for York and neither of them seems perfect. In fact, neither seems satisfactory. I should like the Government to acknowledge that the proposals in clause 5 will mean that our prisons and custodial institutions will be more cluttered up than ever and that something must be done. The Government should think about this Report to see whether they can find a way to prevent what will be a general lengthening of sentences, for young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that one effect of knocking out the detention centre tier would tend to produce longer sentences. Although for other reasons one welcomes the end of borstal, it was a second tier before prison as a third tier. Judges saw borstal as a second tier and were reluctant to come out of the borstal tier into the prison tier for persons between 17 and 21. We are removing that tier and therefore the judicial discretion is completely unfettered. In those circumstances one has to say that, however bad it is to fetter the discretion, the result, particularly for those who come up more than once for offences which carry youth custody sentences, is likely to be that young people will spend longer in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) made the point again and again about whether long sentences were better than short sentences, for example, as deterrents. Those arguments can be addressed to the judges with effect, because they are the ones who impose sentences. But to the Home Office and Home Office Ministers nowadays who know that, whether or not that argument has validity, the prisons are overfull, one hardly needs to go to the second argument about the value or lack of value of a long sentence. They know that, whether long or short sentences have different degrees of value, there are not the places to put people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will surely be aware as a Member of Parliament that his response is to a democratic electorate. The argument is not here to convince Conservative Members, or indeed the Home Secretary, but to carry it out to the general public, which has an effect on the Goverment. The public will not be convinced by arguments about overcrowding in prisons, its response will be, "Build more prisons." However, it may be convinced by the clear and overwhelming argument that longer sentences are not only not more effective but are probably less effective than shorter sentences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I indicated that his arguments were well addressed

to the judiciary who do the sentencing and, I have no doubt, well addressed to the public. I am not criticising him in any way. But whereas the hon. Gentleman might hope that the Home Office would also be convinced by those arguments, even if it is not the first argument is ever-present in its mind because it is responsible for the administration of the prison system and it knows what a terrible state that system is in because of overcrowding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider whether he can leave the clause as it stands on the basis that more time will be spent in prison by young people because of the lack of fetter in an upward direction of the power to sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree very much with the general tenor of what the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) has said. The broad issue was canvassed with eloquence by my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyons) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) and I agree with their broad philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are dealing with a narrow point in these amendments. We are dealing with the period of sentencing of an offender between the age of 17 and 21. The principle that, in relation to an offender who has not yet reached the age of 17, the power of the court should be fettered is already in subsection (7). So the question to which the Government should address themselves is whether it is right that at the age of 17 an offender should be treated regarding length of sentence entirely as if he were an adult, with the same maxima as would apply to a person over 21, or whether there should be some form of staging in between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it would be the normal event for counsel addressing the court on behalf of the young offender to stress his youth if he were between 17 and 21. The vast majority of judges would take that factor into account. There is no doubt about that. If it were thought that any Opposition Mem ber were arguing the contrary, I am sure that it is not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real question is whether it is right, by the provisions of an Act of Parliament remaining on the statute book for many years, that Parliament should be seen to be saying that up to the age of 17 the correct maximum for a sentence of a youth custody is a year, but that once he has passed the age of 17 there should be no maximum other than that for imprisonment for the same offence. If that is so, Parliament will be seen to be stating a policy which in practice none of us wants. It would be difficult for the judiciary in the face of that to feel that, when Parliament produced the legislation, it had in mind, despite those provisions, that a young offender between 17 and 21 should in the ordinary way be dealt with by shorter sentences of youth custody than would be appropriate to imprisonment for those over the age of 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will recognise that as a justifiable principle. I appreciate that it is not so easy to translate that into legislative language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to my hon. Friend, I can see disadvantages in both his amendments. The first is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
somewhat arbitrary cutting in half, which he recognised as not being very satisfactory; and the second, without any qualification, goes further than we want, because there may be exceptional cases. In the ordinary way, the proposition that he puts forward in amendment No. 27 is not far away from what we want, but there will be exceptional cases in which the court ought to have the power to inflict a longer period of custody than 24 months for subsequent offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to bear in mind that when we talk about a subsequent sentence, we talk of a person who is getting towards the age of 21, where the maxima imposed by the clause will go because there will be the ordinary maximum for imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to say " I see the force of what is being put forward as a matter of principle. I should like to do something to give effect to it. I am not happy about the amendment, but I shall take it away and look at it sympathetically to see whether we can create a second tier between 17 and 21 and remove the idea that we should treat young persons within that age group in exactly the same way, apart from the fact that we are putting them into youth custody rather than imprisonment and therefore taking them away from adults, as an offender over the age of 21. If the Minister said something along those lines, I for my part would welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a most interesting debate, and I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the idea of the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) interesting, but, contrary to the intentions of the Government, there would be created a kind of trap here leading to longer sentences for young persons of the 17 to 21 age group. We should be replacing borstal, in consequence of repealing section 2of the 1961 Act, to use custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that I violate the hon. Gentleman's argument if I summarise it in this way. The hon. Gentleman said that what he described as the tariff principle would operate, and that someone who had become eligible for youth custody under the provisions of the Bill would have had one, two or three experiences of custody beforehand and would therefore, in the eyes of the average court, rate a longer sentence of youth custody than the sentence of borstal training which he would get at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with care to the hon. Gentleman's argument, and I think that there is a fallacy in it. I do not think that the tariff principle, as we understand it, is geared to the number of times the offender has been in custody or the number of times that he has offended in the past. I suggest that in general it is geared to the nature of the individual offence. A young person does not necessarily rate a longer sentence in custody by reason of the fact that he has already been in custody before. The primary consideration for the court in each case is the nature of the offence with which it is dealing. I do not think, therefore, that we should make our arrangements in the Bill upon the basis adumbrated by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
hon. Member for York. I suggest that that would be a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important consideration in determining the length of sentence is, as I indicated, the gravity of the offence itself. To the extent that it is proper to talk of a sentencing tariff, I believe that it relates to the gravity of the offence. The sentences of the offender and other considerations do not come into play in considering what, if any, adaptation of the normal tariff sentence is appropriate in that individual case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure provided in the Bill for youth custody sentences removes rather than increases the inhibition upon the courts about imposing shorter sentences on recividists than the sentences previously served. After all, section 3 removes this bar, which I am now familiar with to the extent that even I can get it right first time off without looking at my note. The bar requires that the sentence of custody shall be up to six months or more than three years, unless the offender has already served a sentence at borstal, in which case it is up to six months or more than 18 months. By removing that bar, we are removing a fetter or inhibition which in some cases has, I believe, led to sentences of three years—a longer sentence than is necessary—because the court has satisfied itself, first, that a custodial sentence was necessary, and secondly, that a six-months' custodial sentence—and I am talking about determinate sentences of imprisonment—is far too little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has meant thtat people have gone inside for longer than necessary. Therefore, I am certain that we can claim with justice that by removing section 3 at long last, we are removing an inhibition on the court about imposing shorter sentences. In other words, we are permitting, for example, a sentence of 12 months or of 18 months in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might add that by providing for a double penalty—and I come now to amendment No. 27, the second of the amendments—on second conviction, as the hon. Member for York does in this amendment, we imply the implication that second offences merit heavier penalties 
	<i>per se.</i> This goes contrary to what the hon. Member is providing as the foundation for his whole argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is saying that he fears that courts will, because they are dealing with people who have already experienced custodial sentences, crack it on a bit. He says this would be wrong; I agree that it would be wrong as a matter of principle. Yet he adopts the principle himself in the second of his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what I say is doubted, that courts quite frequently turn aside from the principle that one must escalate successive sentences so that they are always one step up from the last custodial sentence, I think I can rely upon decisions of the Court of Appeal in the case of Craig in 1974, where the defendant had an enormous list of previous convictions, yet the
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
court reduced a sentence of 10 years to one of five and commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The sentence … does not necessarily involve a steady progression up the scale … regard must be had to the nature of the offence."</p></blockquote>
I take issue, first, therefore with the foundation put forward by the hon. Member for York for this pair of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to whether the courts, without statutory fetters, can reasonably be relied upon to work towards shorter sentences. The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) and the hon. Member for York both said they could not; on the other hand, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) said the courts might be trusted in proper cases to provide shorter rather than longer sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are well familiar with 
	<i>Upton v. Bibi.</i> I mention again how grateful I was that the hon. Member for Ormskirk for the first time the other day, so fas as I recall, for the Opposition acknowledged that the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in that case had already yielded some reduction in average sentence lengths. In two very recent cases, however, reported in the present issue of the 
	<i>Criminal Law Review,</i> the Court of Appeal has again made quite significant reductions in the sentences for burglary. I speak from memory, being unable to find my note. In one instance a community service order was substituted for a substantial length of imprisonment, and in another the sentence was reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>Upton v. Bibi</i> was not a one-off instance of guidance from the court; I believe that we are able to observe a consistent policy in which the courts, always making the proviso that violent offender must expect to receive often substantial prison sentences, are consistently giving guidance along the lines first seen in 
	<i>Upton v. Bibi.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. He is quite right; there has been a reduction in the length of sentences passed; I am happy to acknowledge that yet again, but it is only reasonable for the hon. and learned Gentleman also to point out that, set alongside that reduction in sentences passed, there is also the fact that there were 4,000 more custodial sentences passed in 1980 than in 1979. In the last six weeks, as he well knows, as he answered the parliamentary question, the prison population has increased by an unprecedented 2,300. This is what we are dealing with; and the marginal reduction in sentence lengths, welcome though it is, is not reducing the prison population significantly. This is why I and my hon. Friends argue that other measures are necessary and desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course that is why that is argued, but it is not a sound foundation for the course that is proposed. The principal reason why there have been more custodial sentences is that, regrettably, there have been more criminal offences committed that have led to conviction. That is the regrettable fact. Theer have been more offences committed leading to convictions, and it is not a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
wise course to impose much lower maximum sentences for a given class, a juvenile or young adult class, of offender simply in order to cope with the fact that the more convictions in their class have been recorded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister falls into a trap, as many have done, in arguing that the increase in the sentencing is proportionate to the increase in the number of offences committed. He may like to get hold of this document produced by the DHSS, which was produced by my hon. Friend at an earlier session and which indicates quite clearly that the courts are sentencing more people to custodial sentences even allowing for the increase in offending. This is the most serious feature of the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful and take the point the hon. Gentleman makes, but it leads directly to a point that I have already made in our earlier sessions, which is that one of the reasons why courts have been sentencing young offenders more frequently to custodial sentences is because there has been in some areas a loss of confidence in the suitability of the non-custodial options available. I do not say whether it is justifiable, but it has stemmed in part from a loss of confidence in the supervision order as a means of providing proper control over the young offender. In some areas it has stemmed from a loss of confidence in probation orders. It is not necessary for me to say whether it was right or wrong, but it is a fact that the magistrates are drawn from the community; they live within it and serve it. It has been one of the reasons why we have felt it right to enlarge the scope of the non-custodial alternatives available to courts and at the same time offer to courts a greater measure of control in the case of a supervision order over what will be done with and by the young offender who is subject to that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Magistrates' Association has made it very clear to us that there has been a feeling among magistrates that simply making a supervision order gave them insufficient control over the regime that would be followed once the supervision order took effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite take the point of the hon. Member for York; it is not all black and white. It is not all down to one cause; there is more than one cause. Therefore what we propose for the strength of the supervision order in the Bill will go a long way to meet the point just made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly our proposal to extend community service orders to 16-year-olds will have the same effect. I was very pleased to see the other day that this had the warm support of chief probation officers. It is not uncontroversial; other views have been expressed in other quarters, but it was very significant that the chief probation officers expressed their support for that extension of community service orders which at present are available only at the minimum age of 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer additionally to the speech made by the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons). His view was that, if we take
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
away section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1961, we shall increase the length of the sentences that the courts pass, where someone is back before them who has already experienced custody. He says that in the case of someone who has done borstal and is still under licence the sentence of the court is " recall to borstal". That means a minimum, as he knows, of six months in borstal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals offer a greater flexibility to the court. I believe that a court might very well, in the circumstances which we are discussing, wish to say, " six months youth custody". Six months youth custody attracts remission and that will mean four months, subject to good conduct, whereas there is no remission for good conduct in the case of a borstal recall. It is six months in fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is therefore more flexibility here, and I also make the point that it is not a very frequent case for a court to recall to borstal. We must face up to the fact that we are—I think we all agree with this—right in removing the borstal sentence and right in substituting for it the determinate sentence of youth custody and in giving the court the power to say how long the sentence shall be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if we are to go down the road of imposing a statutory maximum for the 17 to 21-year-olds, we are really taking away an important safeguard for the public. I know we are talking about only a relatively small handful—perhaps more than a handful, but a relatively small number—of young adults, but it is worth making the point that even from 1961 onwards, when section 3 was put on the statute book where it still is, there still remained no fetter upon the court for a sentence of three years and above. In other words, Parliament has always thought, certainly since the last war, that it was right that courts should be able, without any statutory fetter, to send a young offender, a young adult, away for an unlimited period above three years, limited only by the maximum amount of imprisonment for an adult. That is the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, though I listened to the debate with great care, and especially to the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), who said, " Do we not want Parliament to express some form of fetter for the 17 to 21-year-olds? " I think the answer to that is " no ". He was right—and he is always very fair—to say that counsel will always stress to the courts that his client is under 21 and is a young adult only. He knows that the court will always give weight to that plea and I believe that, in practice, that that is as much as is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to go for half sentences, halve the maxima, if we were to go down the road that was proposed by the advisory committee, referred to by the hon. Member for Ormskirk, and to say, " Very well, we will fix a maximum at 10 per cent, less than the average sentence imposed for these offences and we will say that that shall be the maximum ", I think it is worth pointing out that that would have the effect in the case of rape, not an untopical subject at the moment, of fixing a maximum of seven years' imprisonment. I do not believe that we should be thought to be exactly in tune with the fears and preoccupations of our constituents if we chose this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
moment to reduce from life to seven years the maximum sentence for rape, and to three years from 14 years the maximum sentence for burglary which would again result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with care and great interest to this debate. I am afraid I would be misleading the Committee if I were to say that at the moment hon. Gentlemen have persuaded me that I ought to say that we will reconsider this. I will of course read with care in the 
	<i>Official Report</i> what has been said, but I believe that we are right in the balance that we have set out in the Bill as drafted, and for those reasons I must advise my hon. Friends not to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather hoping, when the Minister began his speech, that he was going to be more forthcoming than he subsequently turned out to be. The whole of the speech was a disappointment. There is a real issue here. I accept that it is simply a forecast of what might come and no one can be sure about it. No doubt in five years' time we will be able to decide whether I am right or the Minister is right in what turns out to be the practising policy of the judiciary. However, I suspect, from all that has gone before, that I am more likely to be right than he is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only person who has spoken against this amendment, apart from the Minister, was the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), and, if I may say so without in any way being disrespectful, he would, would he not? The hon. and learned Gentleman reflects the attitude of the judiciary towards these matters, and, if I may say so, if his argument was correct, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) is quite right—there ought not to be limitation upon sentencing children between 15 and 17 because the court, in all its wisdom, would know what the right sentence was. However, Parliaments enacting—indeed, he is supporting—a provision which restricts the power of the court to send to prison children between the ages of 15 and 17. If that is the position for them, the principle, I suggest, has already been eroded and the only issue is whether it ought to be eroded for those between 17 and 21 in the same sort of way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, there has been a limitation upon sentencing before 17 in the past and not between 17 and 21, save for section 3, and that there will be occasions when two years might be thought to be too little, but I think that the general principle is right and I suspect, with respect to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich, that, if we were to continue with section 53 of the 1933 Act to deal with the more serious cases, there would be very few cases that would merit less than two years' youth custody that would be dealt with between 17 and 21. Therefore, amendment No. 27 is rather more respectable than he was suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were to go back on section 53, as I was urging them to do this morning, I accept that it might be necessary to allow for a longer
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
period in very remarkable cases if we were to pass something of this kind. I would be quite happy if the Government had said that they would look at it in that light. However, since they are not going to look at it at all, or it does not look as if they are going to look at it, I suggest to my right hon. and learned Friend that we ought to vote for the amendment, at any rate to establish the principle. I am not in any way indicating that if we were to succeed the Government should not come back again with a different view, but I think that the principle itself is sufficiently important for us to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would only say that in the 1980 figures there were 106,000 men between the ages of 17 and 21 who were dealt with by the courts, and of that 106,000, six per cent, were sent to periods of immediate imprisonment. Those sentences, by and large, would have been less than six months. I suspect that if we get youth custody they will be very much higher than six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally I put two points to the Minister. First, I think he misunderstood my argument. My argument was not necessarily that the tariff between 17 and 21 would go up because most people would go to borstal any way and the comparison would not really make very much difference. I was arguing that if the young man had been to youth custody for periods of, say, up to two years, by the time he was 21, when normally he would begin a much lower tariff for imprisonment, he would now be upped on the tariff so that we would be getting a tariff of three years and upwards from 21 on. That, surely, is the crucial issue. It would mean that imprisonment would now be extended for people who are adult offenders, and that jwould overcrowd the prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—and I say it without any sense of disrespect to the Minister or the hon. and learned Gentleman—I think that what he said about courts not sentencing for reconvictions is so wide of what the practical experience of the courts suggests that he must be speaking only as a civil lawyer in what is basically a criminal jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth of the matter, as anybody who has practised in the courts can tell him, is that it is always taken into consideration by anyone passing sentence that a person has previously served a sentence of imprisonment for similar offences. If he had six months for burglary, the liklihood is—'that it was likely that he would get nine months or 12 months for another offence of burglary. That is axiomatic of the tariff in the courts. Whatever the court of Appeal said in some case where the sentence was reduced from 10 years to 5, the fact is that it would not overrule a case where the sentencer had said " I am giving you 12 months for this, because on the last occasion you got six."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right about that. I think it is a wrong principle, and we ought to change that principle in sentencing. I should like to train members of the judiciary to say that they ought to sentence simply for the offence being dealt with. They should not add to it for what the man has already served in a previous sentence. That, however, is the way of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
the world at the moment. I hope that we can change it by judicial education, about which I spoke on an earlier occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allowing for the fact that we are not doing it at the moment, we have to take into account that that is the way that the judiciary will work. If that is true, and I have allowed a certain amount of licence in saying that there should be an extra maximum where the person has previously served youth custody, I consider that two years is the most that any person between 17 and 21 ought to serve in youth custody, unless the offence is of such a grave nature that normally it would fall under section 53, anyway. For that reason, I press the amendment in the confident expectation that, if it were put into practice, it would work as I want it to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 6, line 2, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(2A) Where an offender who—

	<ol>

	<li>is serving a youth custody sentence; and</li>

	<li>is aged over 21 years,</li></ol>
is convicted of one or more further offences for which he is liable to imprisonment, the court shall have the power to pass one or more sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively upon the youth custody sentence.".</p></blockquote>
I am happy to have the opportunity of initiating an amendment to the Bill. The effect of it is to allow a court which is passing a sentence of imprisonment on an adult offender to order that that sentence should run consecutively upon any sentence in youth custody which the offender is already serving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
The purpose of the amendment is to place beyond doubt the court's power to order consecutive sentences. The need for the power can arise when the court is dealing with offences committed while the young offender was unlawfully at large during a youth custody sentence, or offences committed before the youth custody sentence was passed but not dealt with until after the offender had started serving that sentence; or even offences committed in custody. There is no similar power to order a sentence of imprisonment to run consecutively upon a detention centre order, which can only be served in a detention centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to add an additional subsection to place beyond doubt the court's power when passing a sentence of imprisonment. It may be that it is not necessary. We believe that it is; at any rate, for the purpose of avoiding doubt, we think it wise to invite the Committee to make this small amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Court is dealing with an adult offender who is already serving a sentence of youth custody, it can order that a sentence of imprisonment should run consecutively upon the youth custody sentence. This can arise where, for example, an offender has committed a further serious offence while in custody, or has escaped and committed further offences when at large. There is no difficulty in dealing with adult offenders serving such consecutive sentences, and it seems right that the courts ought to have the power to order them where that is appropriate.

	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 6, line 21, leave out paragraph 
	<i>(b)</i> and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) if a court purports to pass a sentence which is precluded by paragraph 
	<i>(a)</i> above, it shall take effect for all purposes as if the sentence were such that the total term did not exceed 12 months.".</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief, because I adumbrated the point which it raises while we were discussing an earlier amendment. In this case, the provision which I seek to replace is one which provides that an offender under 17 years of age shall not be sentenced to a term of youth custody that would exceed 12 months at a time, and accordingly—these are the important words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"so much of any such term for which such an offender is sentenced as exceeds 12 months shall be treated as remitted."</p></blockquote>
When I queried the word " remitted" in an earlier clause, the Minister said that he did not think that it would cause any difficulty. If I recall his words correctly, he said that it would mean, in the context, that the position was as if the sentence were such that it did not exceed the sum in question. By coincidence, perhaps, or perhaps because of like minds thinking in a similar way, those are the words that I put down in the amendment to make quite clear the purpose of this paragraph of the subsection. It is the same problem as before: one wants to avoid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
any possibility that, because of the use of the word " remitted ", a person might lose the ordinary prison remission under the prison rules that it is intended that he should have.

The Minister thought that there was little possibility of that. If the words that I have suggested were used, instead of the word " remitted", which is ambiguous, they would remove all possible doubt, and in every way the effect of the sentence would be as though he had been sentenced to a 12-month term and no more. The Minister moved the amendment on the basis that although it might not be strictly necessary, it would remove a possible doubt. I move my amendment in the same spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a great help to have the attention of a former officer on the legal technicalities as well as to the policy merits of the Bill, and I am most grateful for the care that he is devoting to it. As he says, the point turns on what is meant by " remitted ". I do not believe that there is a danger of confusion, nor that it may be supposed that in such circumstances the court has only purported to pass a sentence when it has exceeded the limit that is appropriate. It will have passed the sentence in question, and in most cases the offender will have to serve most of it. But I wish to consider the point further and at greater leisure. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point appears to merit—if I may so put it without appearing patronising—a revision of the wording in the Bill, we shall gladly do so.

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides for the detention of young offenders of 17 to 21 for the non-payment of fines. If this is a new provision in the criminal justice scheme, it seems a retrograde step that will increase the number of youngsters in custody at a time when we want to reduce the prison population. It is a fact—the Minis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
ter will correct me if I am wrong—that the fastest-growing sector of the prison population is fine defaulters. We should be considering ways to reduce rather than increase that sector. I realise that fines are flexible and relatively cheap to administer and, therefore, are an attractive form of penalty, but we are dealing with people who either wilfully will not or, more probably, cannot pay the fine. Perhaps the Minister has some evidence whether their reasons for default have been examined—to what extent they are wilfully refusing or literally do not have the money to pay the fine. The fact remains that if they cannot pay the fine and are put in prison, as is proposed, the taxpayer then incurs the cost of maintaining them. We are told that the taxpayer now has to pay £7,000 a year to support somebody in custody. The imprisonment of a defaulter is an admission of defeat by the courts—and by society generally,—because the court wanted to fine him, but was forced to use some other form of punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) said earlier that the only sanction against a fine defaulter is prison. Does the Minister agree? Is it really the only sanction? Could not other forms of so-called punishment, such as non-custodial, be used against a fine defaulter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What thought has been given to the fine imposed being a reasonable one that an offender can pay? Is it ever deliberately related to his income, as well as to the gravity of the offence? If a court imposes a fine that it knows the offender cannot pay, it might as well impose a custodial sentence in the first place. We should encourage courts not to impose wholly unrealistic fines, especially when many youngsters are now unemployed and less able to pay a fine than if they were in full employment. I hope that the Minister will comment on some of the issues raised by clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady was uncharacteristically mistaken when she suggested that we were discussing a new penalty. It is not a new penalty, but a new form of committal to custody, made necessary as a consequence of the abolition of imprisonment for offenders aged 17 to 20. In other words, it does not change the substance of the courts' powers to deal with such persons, but the form of committal and the places in which they can be held are brought into line with the new custodial structure for young offenders. It is purely consequential from the changes in the structure of sentencing for young offenders brought about by part I of the Bill. The provision is subject to the safeguard in clause 1(5), so that a court cannot commit a person to be detained, or even fix a term of detention in the event of a default,
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless it is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate ".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady asked whether there was any other sanction. She will know that the courts are reluctant to commit anybody to custody, and especially a young offender, in default of paying a fine. She will know of the procedural safeguards that ensure that every possibility is considered before that ultimate sanction is imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
The hon. Lady will also know, because it has been mentioned more than once in our recent debates, that one has to have the ultimate sanction of imprisonment for a fine defaulter if there is not to be a very much larger sum of money outstanding in the form of unpaid fines. The experience in many cases is that only when committal is ordered is the fine paid; very often it is then paid straight-away or within a day or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our concern not to imprison youngsters for failing to pay fines, we must not overlook the great sense of injustice and anger that exists at the knowledge that people can get away for quite a time without paying a fine. If we enlarged that abuse and scandal by taking away the ultimate sanction of imprisonment for default, people would say that the criminal justice system was being administered in a way that was quite divorced from what ordinary lay people in the country regard as common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked what thought had been given to ensuring that the fines are reasonable. She will know that the court is obliged to consider the means and circumstances of the offender. That appears to be the sensible method. No one wants people to go to prison for failing to pay a fine. As she says, one has to be wilfully culpable or to have culpably neglected to pay a fine. Clearly, if one fixes a fine which is more than can be paid, the whole thing ceases to make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I want to consider the point. A number of reasons may be responsible. It may be that the courts fine very many more people of bad criminal character than previously was the case, seeking not to send them to prison in the first instance. If there are deliberate refusals to pay fines, that leads to an increase in the number of people going to prison. That appears to be an entirely possible explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Government's policy, in dealing with what are plainly regarded as the tail end of offences—relatively minor ones—to introduce some intermediate measure between fine and imprisonment? If such a provision is included in the Bill already, I apologise. Perhaps the Minister will remind me of where it is. There is a strong case for keeping people out of prison and giving them some other form of penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government would need to consider that point. The ultimate sanction must be imprisonment, for the reasons that I have given. In the first instance I doubt that a court would wish to fine if it felt that some other form of disposal was appropriate. The Government will pay attention to what has been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can now tell the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) that the number of young men under 21 taken into prison since 1980 for default of fines was slightly more than 3,000. That figure may give a false impression because the length of time that people stay in prison for default is generally very short—indeed, it is measured in days. The hon. Gentleman will know that there are statutory limits upon the amount of time that people may be ordered to be detained in prison for default of a fine. There are tables which apply to the magistrates' courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Entirely adequate safeguards are already imposed by Parliament upon the courts to ensure that it is in only the last resort, where failure to pay a fine has been not because of insufficient means, but because of culpable behaviour by the offender, that the ultimate sanction is imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are attachment of earnings orders and orders may be made for payment by instalments. There is also provision for variations of payments made. If someone is in difficulties in meeting a fine, he may ask the court for the outstanding amount to be written off. All those options are available.

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 8 enacts an important and long-overdue reform that I welcome, namely, it provides that youth custody and detention centre sentences take into account time spent in custody and on remand. That is in line with the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Penal System in its report of 1974 on young adult offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier session the Minister rather surprisingly accused me of implying that there was a monopoly of compassion by Opposition Members and that Government Members were activated by something he described as "bloodless". I take a great deal of exception to that comment—first, because many of the amendments which I and my right hon. and hon. Friends are moving are all-party
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
amendments and have signatures from not only Labour Members but Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also on record as having both castigated and criticised previous Labour Home Secretaries for their inaction in the area of penal reform—just as I have been prepared to pay public testimony to the efforts of the present Conservative Home Secretary to reduce the lengths of prison sentences. It is rather uncalled for for a Minister to suggest that somehow or other the Opposition—and me in particular—are adopting a holier than thou, righteous position on these matters when clearly the evidence is quite to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the third time in Committee that I have commended and congratulated the Government and welcomed the action taken by them. I know that it will not be the last occasion, so it ill becomes the Minister to make the comments that he is rather apt to make on occasions. It is not the first time—he has made several similar snide remarks. [HON. MEMBERS: " Shame".]. I agree that it is disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Justices' Clerks' Society in its document " Observations On the Criminal Justice Bill" welcomed clause 8, but pointed out that neither clause 8, nor section 67 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, which it amends, makes it clear whether remand in local authority care should count against the sentence. I hope that the Minister will give some guidance on that point because it is important. I assume that it does not count, otherwise clause 8 would make that quite clear. In some cases a remand in local authority care means physical separation and loss of liberty, for example, where a child or young offender is held in secure accommodation. On other occasions it may mean that the offender is held in local authority observation or assessment centres that are not secure in themselves, but nevertheless involve a deprivation of individual liberty and a clear element of detention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that when a child is in local authority care he is sometimes allowed time with his parents, guardian or other relatives. I do not suggest, nor does the Justices' Clerks' Society, that that time should be counted against any sentence. Nevertheless, the society has suggested that, excluding time that children spend with their parents or relatives, time spent on remand in local authority care should count against their custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inner London Juvenile Courts Panel, in a memorandum circulated to members of the Committee, did not go quite as far as the Justices' Clerks' Society, but asked that time spent by a juvenile in secure accommodation in local authority care should count against any custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to suggest, nor do I wish to give the impression to the staff who work in local authority residential establishments, that those establishments are in any way to be rated with penal establishments. They are not, but I am sure that the staff would accept that both residential establishments and penal establishments means a loss of individual liberty for those incarcerated within them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
It was for that reason that the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group recommended that a court should consider time spent in custody in local authority care when determining the length of custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will feel able to respond positively to this important and somewhat technical point, and at least give an assurance that in any future circular guidance to the courts, or when the Bill is enacted, the courts will be encouraged to ensure that when they are passing a custodial sentence any time that an individual has spent in secure custody is subtracted. I hope the Minister can give those assurances before we proceed to deal exclusively with clause 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take at once the first point raised by the hon. Member for Ormskirk. He must make allowances for the fact that Ministers in charge of Bills become defensive and vulnerable. I acknowledge his congratulations to the Government on the various matters that have met with his approval. I am sure that more will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right that remand in care does not count towards sentence. He asked for an extension of the innovation of clause 8, which extends to detention centre and youth custody sentences the present provision for imprisonment, namely that time spent on remand counts against the ultimate sentence. He also asked that local authority secure care should count against sentence. I cannot promise him that because, as he has acknowledged, not only is it important that local authority care should not be regarded as a penal sentence, it would be extremely difficult to extend the remand time provision to cover secure care because the degree of security varies not simply from case to case but from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that someone may be ordered into secure local authority care by for one day, two days or a week. It would impose great difficulties if the remand time in secure care counted against the sentence. Although I have listened carefully to what he said, and understand what lies behind the proposal. I cannot say that the Government will consider writing such a provision into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been no amendments proposed to clause 8—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept a great deal of what the Minister says, but will he accept that I am disappointed by his non-committal response? A very important principle is involved. The Government have now accepted that what is right and proper for adult offenders should be applied to young offenders, namely, that those on remand should have that time counted against their sentence. If the extension of that principle to young offenders is right, why it is not also right to take it logically further and take into account the time spent in custody in local authority care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the hon. and learned Gentleman says about the variations in the type of secure accommodation and the amount of time people spend in local authority institutions; but at least
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
he could agree to issue a circular to the courts asking them to do nothing more than to take into account the time that an individual has spent in local authority care.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite certain that it will be the invariable practice of the court ultimately passing a custodial sentence on a young offender to take into account the fact that he has been in local authority care to the extent that, whether he was in secure or insecure accommodation, he has been deprived of his liberty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that that point may be suitable for inclusion in a circular. I will not give a commitment to do so because that practice is invariably followed anyway. Anyone representing a young offender and speaking in mitigation will always draw attention to the time that has been spent in care. It would not be helpful to say more about that in a debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 66 concerns the desire to prohibit the present overcrowding of penal establishments for young offenders, and provides for courts to be notified of the number of vacancies in them. Despite the overcrowding, it is essential that there should be adequate work and educational and recreational activities for youngsters in custody. I draw the Minister's attention to the views of the prison and borstal governors' branch of the Society of Civil and Public Servants. It believes that it would be a good idea to fix a maximum capacity for the young offender system, based on a publicly-declared set of assumptions about the permitted levels of overcrowding in the various types of establishments, and the distribution of the population within the system. That should prevent an unlimited or indefinite number of young people being put into prisons that cannot absord them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could serve to build on and reinforce the current position for detention centres, where the court is supposed to check that a vacancy exists before
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
committing an offender. If they can do it for detention centres, why cannot they do it for youth custody centres?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but I think that I can help her. There is no obligation upon a court to ensure that there is a vacancy in a detention centre before passing a sentence. It is frequently, though not always done, but is not an obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a good idea if it were, would it not? We could then try to avoid overcrowding. As the Minister says, in theory it is often the practice, but it is not actually laid down as such. Could not that practice for detention centres be extended to youth custody centres? It is more important there, because it is desirable for youth custody centres to provide work and educational and recreational activities and not simply confine young people in a penal establishment and let them go at the end of their sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not wholly relevant, but the parole board chairman, Lord Harris, has virtually admitted that the board now takes into consideration the accommodation available in individual prisons when examining the cases of prisoners. If it takes that into consideration when somebody is in prison, why should not the courts do so before that person is sentenced? It is surely better to do it before someone is put into an overcrowded prison, rather than after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 67 is even more reasonable than amendment No. 66. It requires courts to be notified at monthly intervals of the number of vacancies available in penal establishments for young offenders. In many instances the courts already check 
	<div class='sub'>f</div> <!-- sub -->the availability of accommodation in detention centres. It would be helpful to bring to the attention of the courts any limits on available accommodation, especially in youth custody centres. I remind the Committee of the House of Commons Expenditure Committee's 1978 report, " The Reduction of Pressure on the Prison System ". It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Sub-Committee desire to make it clear that they would not wish to interfere in any way with the right of a court to send a person to prison. We feel, however, that it would be helpful to provide regular status reports on prison and borstal institutions, giving information about the accommodation available, and we recommend that such information should be available to all Crown Courts and magistrates' courts."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the succinct way in which she moved the amendments. We are all concerned about overcrowding in the prisons and I am grateful for what has been said in this Committee about the efforts of the present Government to reduce that overcrowding, all the time with the qualification that cannot be too often stated, that the prisons must have space available and the courts must have sentences available that are quite substantial for violent offenders and, indeed, very substantial in bad cases for the protection of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment would mean that remand centres, detention centres and youth custody centres could accommodate at any one time no more than a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
specified number of inmates set by reference to " certified normal accommodation" which the amendment itself does not attempt to define. It is, however, in common administrative use by the Prison Department to mean the level of population an establishment will hold without overcrowding of cells or dormitories. Therefore, I will not dwell on that point except to say that the amendment could not stand without some supporting statutory definition of CNA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a more important facet to this matter. The debate and the amendment reflect an objective which I think we all share, that the number of persons under 21 who are in custody should be related to the number of places provided under an accommodation scale designed to avoid the overcrowding of cells or dormitories. That is what it is about. It cannot, however, be an overriding one, by which I mean that it cannot override other objectives such as the need, in proper cases, to keep dangerous young offenders in a place in which they will not, for the duration of their sentence, be able to harm other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid therefore that it follows that the Government cannot accept the means that is proposed in this amendment to meet the problem. If the amendment were incorporated in legislation the Prison Department would be faced with a combination of statutory requirements which would be very difficult to satisfy fully and at all times—that is, to receive under-21s, remanded or sentenced to custody by the courts and to ensure that populations in particular establishments, or ranges of establishments, did not rise above a certain level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot be sure that the supply of young offender places will always meet demand. Either more accommodation would have to be found to meet a sudden peak or the courts would have to refrain from committing or sentencing people to custody. While that is a logical approach, we cannot accept that it is a practical one. I think it would give rise to very considerable feelings of unfairness and injustice as between one offender and another if one month there was space in the prisons within CNA, whereas next month, due to some administrative reason that space was not available, someone equally culpable, dealt with, perhaps only for administrative reasons, a month later would find that he did not get a custodial sentence. That is not consistent with most people's idea of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the remand centre system, the implication would mean finding extra places for about 700 people. This gap cannot be closed in the near future, and, to the extent that it remains, the only alternative would be to remove the people concerned from remand centres to local prison places, which is not what any of us want. The conditions for the inmates left in remand centres would undoubtedly improve but only at the expense of those removed elsewhere. We all know that it is in the local prisons where the worst overcrowding exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the case of sentenced young offenders. The average population of detention centres and borstals
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
is generally below their certified normal accommodation. With the bulk of the future youth custody centres which we want to operate within their CNAs but which it is in the interests of all that we use fully, there are bound to be times in certain places where it is justifiable to go above the normal accommodation. For example, if some sleeping accommodation had to be taken out of use unexpectedly it may be better to have temporary overcrowding to avoid disruption of people's training programmes through transfer elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other theoretical alternative and arbitrary restrictions on the power of the courts to sentence in a certain case because an establishment or a range of establishments has reached normal accommodation. It is entirely right for the courts to consider their decisions with care and to use custody with restraint and to bear in mind what will happen after the sentence, which includes the condition of the prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government think that it is much better to rely on the general principle that the courts should pass long custodial sentences wherever possible and shorter sentences when custody is unavoidable, save in the case of violent offenders. We could not go reasonably beyond this and impose so direct and arbitrary a restriction on the courts' discretion in individual cases which is tied to the CNA of custodial establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts have a serious task to carry out on behalf of the community, and it is in all our interests that they are able to commit to custody when necessary, even when that should have the regrettable consequence of imposing a population upon a given prison establishment which is in excess of what at present is regarded as a certified normal accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 67 has the effect of requiring the Secretary of State to notify the courts once a month of the number of vacancies available in remand and detention centres and youth custody centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was tabled with and is linked to the one we have just discussed. I see its attraction and I understand what lies behind it. Certainly it is important that the courts are aware of the pressures under which the system operates, and the Government will continue to take every opportunity to make known those pressures, including pressures of numbers, and to encourage frequent contact between magistrates, judges and staff of custodial establishments. That can only be to the good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a difference between the courts being made aware of the general situation and being confronted at monthly intervals with detailed returns to the extent that these were intended to, as it were, pressurise them about particular decisions—custodial or non-custodial—that they take in any given month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the extent that that feeling of pressure would be present, I believe that unfairness could arise as between one defendant and another, as I indicated earlier, whose sentences for what might be identical offences would depend upon the state of the prisons from one month to the next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Surely what my hon. Friend is proposing is not to put pressure on the courts but to require them to be more selective in ensuring that only those who really need a custodial sentence are given such a sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister suggesting that if we reached the point where six prisoners were being accommodated in a cell for one the courts should be oblivious to that kind of pressure and should continue sentencing, irrespective of what is happening? Surely at some point the courts must acknowledge the physical conditions to which they are actually committing an individual. Presumably the Minister would not say that the courts should never, in any circumstances, acknowledge the physical conditions to which they are committing offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example given by the hon. Gentleman imposes an obligation upon the Home Secretary. That is the point. The choice is between imposing statutory restrictions upon the courts which would be calculated by reference to the state of the prison population on the one hand and emphasising the responsibility of the Home Secretary to provide sufficient custodial accommodation to meet the numbers sentenced by the courts on the other hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to put it fairly in saying that the courts should take into account the general state of the prisons and of prison population, and I believe that they properly do. But it is not right to proceed along lines that would impose a fetter upon the courts' power to sentence custodially, whose effect would come into play when a certain number was reached in each prison. I do not believe that that is consistent with the interests of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are practical considerations as well. If detention centres were above their normal accommodation and youth custody centres were generally at or just below it, a court might well feel obliged to say " Not detention centre, but youth custody ", which means a longer sentence. That would take us into country which we would wish to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more, it would not necessarily ensure that the courts had up to date information. The population of remand centres varies, not just from day to day but from hour to hour. In a detention centre, the population level can change significantly in a week or two. Only in the youth custody centres would we expect greater stability, but even there we could have vacancies in open establishments while the youth custody system as a whole was under pressure, which again could mislead the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of the need not to give the impression that we are motoring on, complacently content with the arrangements we have at present. I fully understand what lies behind the amendment. Perhaps people are becoming weary of hearing other people say in Committee that we share the same objective, but we do, certainly as regard overcrowding in prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said has indicated that the Government, while committed to reducing overcrowding as soon as they reasonably can, do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
feel that this numerical approach is the right way of doing it, because we do not feel that it is, overall, consistent with the interest of justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister would say that, whilst he would not wish to accept an obligation such as amendment No. 67 provides written into the Bill, nonetheless, he would ensure that by the ordinary administrative means the courts were kept regularly informed of the state of these institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, a court may be faced with the question of whether to remand a young person in custody in a case which may be on the borderline, where the court might be much more inclined to do so if it meant remand in a remand centre than if it meant remand to a prison. Surely that is the kind of information the courts ought to have, not month by month but, as far as possible, day by day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, whilst I entirely accept that the intention of this legislation is to make a clear distinction between the detention centre order and the youth custody order, nonetheless there will be cases where the decision between the two is finely balanced, and it would assist the court to know, for example, that detention centres at that time are full and overcrowded whereas there is available accommodation in youth custody centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, my recollection is that in the past some judges asked for information about detention centres and their availability. That information was not always immediately available. Sometimes it meant a remand to obtain it. Surely it is the type of information that a court should have on top so that it can make these decisions with full knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been considering whether we can do anything to help in this regard. The courts are kept informed of the state of the prison population in the various establishments, and I see that it is important that that information should be up-to-date so far as is reasonably practicable. I shall look seriously to see whether the frequency or the scale upon which the courts are informed of these matters can be improved. Perhaps that will help matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for thai indication. Clearly, any such information should be given on a regular basis and if that is what the Minister is looking at, for my part I would wish to say no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The limitless capacity of Parliament to astound never ceases to have its great effect upon me.

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot allow the clause to pass without drawing the Minister's attention to the youth custody establishments that may be available for young women offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of young women as a whole in custody is relatively small and the problems of managing with them is actually that much less. Yet it is the arrangements for the accommodation of young women offenders that are perhaps the most unsavoury and unsatisfactory feature of the penal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there are few establishments that could be used as youth custody centres for young women. For example, there is only one closed borstal, Bull-wood Hall, about which we have heard a great deal in recent weeks, and only one open borstal for women, East Sutton Park. Both of them, unfortunately, are located in the South-East, although there are small borstal units in three adult women establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the results of these two institutions for young women, both of which presumably will have to be brought into the youth custody system, is that many of the young girls sentenced to them come from geographical locations well away from the South-East. Their parents, relatives, friends, probation officers and social workers who wish or who are required to visit them have to become involved in extremely long, arduous and tiring journeys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is particularly the case in relation to Bull-wood Hall, which is located in south-east Essex but which, in fact, draws about two-thirds of its inmates from North of the Wash. The result of that is that, in 1978, 29 per cent, of the girls at Bullwood Hall had no visits from family or friends during their stay there, which averages out at about seven months. A further 20 per cent, of the girls had only one visit and the same kind of considerations—a long, difficult, tiring journey—also apparently inhibits visits from probation officers or from social workers. In 1978 again, 50 per cent, of the girls in borstal at Bullwood Hall had no visit at all from a probation officer or from a social worker. In 1979-80, 29 per cent, had had no visit from probation officers or social workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister gets up to chide me with an omission I did not make and did not intend, I acknowledge that the staff at Bullwood Hall make a great deal of effort to ensure that the girls maintain
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
proper relations and contact with their families, friends, probation officers and social workers. The staff does a great deal to ensure that the girls will, when released, become properly and fully reintegrated into the community from which they have been wrenched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, given the kind of figures that I have just mentioned, it is extremely difficult for the most efficient and well-intentioned of prison officers and staff at Bullwood Hall actually to make a reality of any rehabilitation on the part of young offenders when they have lost contact for such a long period of time with all those in the community who may be able to help them to reintegrate and to become law abiding and positive members of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inconvenience of the location of Bullwood Hall has been referred to by many organisations and many individuals over a considerable period. The Advisory Council on the Penal System's report on young offenders in paragraph 324 recommended that Bullwood Hall should cease to be a borstal as soon as possible. In 1979 the prison and borstal governors recommended that there should instead be a number of smaller borstal units. The same kind of approach has been reiterated by the Magistrates' Association, by the chief conference of probation officers, by the National Association of Probation Officers, by the Howard League and by NACRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its observations on the White Paper " Young Offenders", the Magistrates' Association said of young women:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those who are remanded or who eventually find their way into custody should be accommodated in small units as close as possible to their homes, so that effective contact could be maintained with families and supervising officers, and in those instances where good relationships have been established with prison officers and therapists it might be possible to continue support after release. Serious consideration should be given to establishing these units adjacent to male establishments, making it possible for staff to mix freely and trainees to join in some shared activities … The Butler Committee and the Younger Committee both urged that Bullwood Hall, the only closed female borstal, should be closed because of its unsuitable design and location so far from the homes of the majority of its inmates. A decision to implement these recommendations and establish the type of units referred to above is long overdue."</p></blockquote>
In our report on young offenders, the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group concluded that young adult women in custody should be located in small youth custody units attached, perhaps, to male establishments and that opportunities should be created there and developed for co-educational activities involving both male and female young offenders. This is not something that can be achieved overnight, although in saying that it is also reasonable to point out that such a measure has been advocated for many years by organisations, as I have already indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it would be encouraging if the Minister would respond to the debate, not by saying that this is what he will implement when the Bill becomes law but, at least, that this is the way that the Government would like to proceed, and that the Government's policy will be devoted towards the objective
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
of moving in the direction of closing down the inexcessible, badly-located institutions and establishing instead a larger number of smaller female units along the lines of that described both in the observations of the Magistrates' Association and as recommended in the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a number of issues about women in the penal system which call for attention and reform, and one of those areas actually is left out. Whereas most of the research goes on the number of men in the penal system and how to cope with that problem, there is remarkably little research done about women, and we ought to reverse that situation. I should like to hear what the Minister thinks about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been two trends in recent years—first, a steady growth in the number of women in custody and, secondly, the use of drugs in female custodial establishments, which gives special cause for anxiety. In March 1980 there were 1,646 women in custody, and that was a record. The average daily population of males fell between 1979 and 1980 by 0-4 per cent., but the average of females rose by 4 per cent.—something which we should take account of because it is a problem which is growing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of drugs prescribed in women's establishments has been mounting since the publication of the 1979 report of the Prison Department which revealed for the first time the quantities of drugs being used in a year. The 1980 report of the Prison Department showed that 224,906 doses of drugs were dispensed in 1980 in Holloway prison. Among the men's prisons only Wandsworth exceeded this total. The average population of Wandsworth prison in 1980 was 1,422, whereas in Holloway it was only 451.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the reading I have been able to do, particularly since I have become a member of the Committee, all too often the subject of women in prison, although their numbers are small comparatively, is considered as an afterthought rather than as the focus of a study in the penal system. It is to be hoped that that will be changed over the next few years as more forward and radical thinking comes across about the penal system. Both Government and non-Government reports tend to allot only a few lines to what happens to women in prison and to concentrate more on male juveniles or young and adult prisoners. The Government's White Paper confines its comments on young women offenders to less than one page, which confirms what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 refers to section 43 (2) of the Prison Act 1952, which specifically refers to the Secretary of State's powers, and I have read closely the explanatory note circulated by the Minister. In substituting clause 9 for section 43 of the Prison Act 1952 is just to juggle about with words, and I should like some information and assurance about what will be a remand centre and what will be a prison. As it stands, clause 9 is saying that something which has been a prison could become a remand centre and vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has made a substantial reference to the whole question of Bullwood Hall, which exercises everyone's mind who thinks of young females in prison, but, there again, although Bullwood Hall is a borstal and borstals will no longer exist, what will Bullwood Hall be used for? Will it simply have its name changed to something else and continue to be an unsuitable place not only for young women but for anyone at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent weeks we have read a lot in the newspapers about what has happened at Bullwood Hall and the publicity which has been given to it recently has only highlighted, in 1982 circumstances, what has been going on there for very many years and which has been reflected in previous reports. I should like an assurance, therefore, that when Bullwood Hall ceases to be a borstal when borstals cease to exist, Bullwood Hall itself will not continue as an institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many young women at Bullwood Hall—over half of them, I understand—have some kind of psychiatric treatment, and I am very much of the opinion—this does not just apply to women, but it has a special application to women—that we should look more carefully at what kind of work is allocated under community service orders, so that sometimes women could be given, as an alternative, a CSO which would perhaps involve them in doing what very often they have an aptitude for, which is looking after children or elderly or disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When they are committed into custody more attention should be given to the kind of accommodation which is more civilised than the Bullwood Hall type of accommodation, in smaller units where they would have the opportunity of mixing with prisoners in male establishments, for example, under proper supervision, of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not something which has come as "pie out of the sky" but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk quoted from the Magistrates' Association report, is something which that body approves of too. We should be looking forward to much more modern accommodation and atmosphere which might prevent the sort of situation we have heard about recently. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that some further thought is being given to the whole question of women in the penal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer the Minister to clause 9(2), and in what I am going to say I have the support of the Women's National Commission. Before hon. Members opposite think, "What is that?", I point out that it is a body of which one of the co-chairmen is no less a figure than the redoubtable Baroness Young, who is the Prime Minister's right-hand woman, we are led to believe. Therefore I hope they will give very serious consideration to the comments which have been compiled by the commission on the whole of this Bill, but I am referring specifically to clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 9 we have, yet again, different treatment for boys and for girls. We have a situation in clause 9 where, if the Secretary of State sees fit, he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
may from time to time see to it that a woman over 21 is serving a sentence of imprisonment in a remand centre or a youth custody centre where she could well be, in certain circumstances, with young girls of even 15 years of age, whereas, apparently, an adult male prisoner is, in no circumstances, even from time to time, going to find himself with boys of such a young age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is suitable and appropriate for adult women prisoners to mix with very young girl prisoners, why is it not suitable and appropriate for the same situation to apply to men? I should be interested to know why there is not the same treatment. Either we decide that this mixing is totally inappropriate, which I would say it is, or that it is appropriate. The Government seem to think that it is appropriate for one lot of prisoners, women, and not for the men. On what basis does he give that opinion? The Women's National Commission—-Baroness Young, no less—says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are deeply concerned at the proposal to accommodate girls and adult women prisoners together in the same custody centres. We dispute the assertion in paragraph 25 of the White Paper " Young Offenders" that such sharing of facilities can be " positively beneficial"."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
Can the Minister say why he considers it is so " positively beneficial" for women and girls, but not for men and boys?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the criteria that would lead the Secretary of State from time to time to mix the adults with the very young prisoners? Is it overcrowding that would force adult women prisoners to be with the younger ones? Is that the criterion, because we have extreme overcrowding in the male prisons? That is not a condition peculiar to female prisons. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will answer these questions, which are not explained in the Bill, and also bear in mind the very important points made by my two hon. Friends with regard to girls' borstals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
