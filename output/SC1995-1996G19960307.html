	<br><blockquote><p>'Notice by tenants'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>15(A) A tenant may end an assured or assured tenants' shorthold tenancy by giving the landlord reasonable notice in writing".—[
	<i>Mr. Raynsford </i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to a minor technical new clause, which is designed to remedy an anomaly that has been created under clauses 75 and 76. I have read the 
	<i>Hansard</i> report of the previous sitting, so I am conversant with the arguments that were advanced then. As the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), said on Tuesday, the clauses will allow a private sector landlord to create a periodic tenancy from the outset in the case of an assured shorthold tenancy. That will give no contractual fixed term for that tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under normal landlord and tenant law, a tenant may determine a periodic tenancy at any time upon giving reasonable notice. When there is a contractual fixed term, many standard tenancy agreements include in their terms a break clause, whereby a tenant can determine the tenancy upon four weeks' notice. The new clause would regularise the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new clause is not included in the Bill, it will be possible in theory for private sector tenants to be unable to move because there is no provision to allow the tenant to determine the tenancy. I hope that the Undersecretary, when he has reflected on the matter, will realise that the new clause is sensible and that it is designed to improve the procedure and to avoid a potential anomaly. If he does not agree with the wording because it is not as simple and straightforward as 14 days, but is more complicated than that, I hope that he will accept its principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I am not sure that the new clause is as technical as he would have us believe. He made the fair point that the landlord and tenant may agree to include a break clause in the tenancy agreement from the outset, but that is a matter for them to conclude freely at the outset of the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
The new clause would insert into every agreement a break clause for the tenant only. It would, therefore, inhibit the parties' freedom to conclude an agreement between themselves into which they were both freely prepared to enter. The insertion of such an amendment into every fixed-term tenancy, especially every fixed-term assured shorthold tenancy, would undermine the position of the landlord. The incentive for a landlord to grant a fixed-term assured shorthold tenancy is the assurance that the tenant is prepared to pay the rent throughout the period of that fixed-term tenancy. If such a clause were inserted into each agreement, the landlord would lose that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Circumstances may arise in which a landlord feels that there is little in it for him to grant a fixed-term assured tenancy. He might consider it to be of no advantage to grant a term for longer than a minimum because the tenant could, in any event, bring the tenancy to an end by giving reasonable notice. The hon. Gentleman may think that it is reasonable that landlords should be subject to that lack of assurance. However, as is often the case with regulation of tenancies by the state, if such regulations were inserted into each contract, thus undermining the freedom of contract, they would have an adverse effect for the private rented sector as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords might be unwilling to grant fixed-term tenancies, especially fixed-term assured shorthold tenancies. That may result in a shortage of such tenancies. The new clause would undermine the freedom of contract between the two sides. It would undermine the position of landlords. It is not desirable. It is up to the landlord and tenant at the outset to conclude whatever agreement they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not an adequate answer. In two important ways, the Bill will reduce tenants' rights. It will allow landlords to create shorthold tenancies as default tenancies and will reduce the amount of time that tenants can be in arrears before becoming subject to mandatory eviction. The new clause is a small measure designed to provide an element of relief for tenants. As the Minister stated clearly on Tuesday, tenants could find themselves in a periodic tenancy with no provision for termination, and if they chose to end the tenancy they could be sued by the landlord for the income that he might otherwise have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reject the new clause on the ground that it will undermine the market is nonsense. Landlords will be allowed, in every instance if they wish, to let on assured shorthold tenancies, the only obligation on the landlords being to let for a six-month period. To cavil at the new clause because it would somehow damage the market does not carry any credibility. I am astonished that the Minister should take such a negative view about such a simple, straightforward and reasonable proposal. I hope that he will be more accommodating in future. However, I wish to make progress so that we can deal with other business—particularly with housing benefit so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 25 is meant to prevent landlords evicting tenants simply because the tenants have used their right under the law to have repairs made to the property, to have unreasonably high rents reduced, or to have put right any of the other things that tenants should be able to have put right. At present, whether such complaints are made directly to the landlord or through an environmental health officer, the landlord's reaction may be not to respond to the complaint, right the wrong, or make the necessary repairs, but to evict the tenant. That problem is particularly bad for assured shorthold tenancies because that limited period of security has weakened the tenants' bargaining power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Government have too often supported the landlord to the detriment of the tenant. The new clause would redress that imbalance. Many tenants attempt to enforce their statutory or contractual rights, but their landlords either fail to renew the tenancy or seek possession at the end of the shorthold tenancy. The result is that not only the tenants who complain or who try to enforce their contractual rights
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
have to pay excessive rents, or live in dangerous or unsafe conditions, but subsequent tenants also suffer the same problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, many of the examples that I cite sadly, are, from my constituency. Today I shall give another example from Lewisham. A large number of students live in the borough, who study at the excellent Goldsmiths' college. Many of them live in the private rented sector. One group of students was given a standard six-month tenancy starting in October, at the beginning of the academic year. They discovered in January that the landlord had been running the meters at a higher level and was overcharging them for the resale of the electricity and gas. They spoke to the landlord about that and asked him to reset the meters and make a refund, taking the beneficial attitude that the landlord might simply have made a mistake. The landlord's response was to say that if the students made a fuss they could get out. Indeed, in the middle of January they received notice of possession and they were out by the beginning of April. They were expecting to take their exams in May, so they were in a particularly difficult position. The landlord re-let the property immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are more serious cases, involving unsafe conditions. A woman in Kent with two young children rented a flat for the six-month shorthold tenancy. She was a mature student. Such cases particularly affect the student population. She discovered that the gas fires in her flat were dangerous because of the escape of carbon monoxide gas. The landlord refused to do anything about it so, with the help of a student welfare officer, she contacted the Health and Safety Executive, which asked the landlord to sort the fires out. The woman was studying for a degree to give her young family security and herself a decent job. She had paid her rent on time, had been a good tenant and had done nothing wrong, but the landlord took eviction proceedings against her. He made it clear that he wanted possession because she had complained. After she left, he immediately re-let the property and did nothing about the gas fires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is about not only giving tenants better bargaining powers but ensuring that they live in safe properties. It would also ensure that landlords did not behave irresponsibly, leaving their flats in a second-rate, substandard fashion. As my hon. Friends have said, allowing landlords to behave in such a way harms the good landlords who want to let decent property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary might respond by saying that there are already procedures to deal with such matters and that there are environmental health officers. However, environmental health officers often have to respond to tenants discreetly and clandestinely, as they realise that if the landlord finds out that tenants have complained, the tenants are likely to be evicted. We want procedures to be open, straightforward and clear, so that landlords obey the law, provide safe property and do not evict tenants who simply try to enforce their contractual or statutory rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady's concerns, but I do not believe that the new clause, as drafted, is workable or practicable, and I have doubts as to its desirability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
Under the new clause, a complaint, a reference to a rent assessment committee or one of the other actions envisaged in the clause would possibly override all the grounds for possession under the Housing Act 1988, including the ground for possession of an assured shorthold tenancy, whereby a landlord is assured of bringing the tenancy to an end at the expiry of the fixed period or after six months, on giving two months' notice. That is an imporant feature of the assured shorthold tenancy regime. Landlords should have the assurance of knowing that they can definitely obtain possession at the end of the period and that the end of the period is a mandatory ground for repossession. As the Committee has heard, not all landlords seek repossession; many are content with their tenants, and many tenants are content with their landlords, so that tenancies last for a much longer period. However, it is important that landlords have the assurance that they can recover their property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would override all grounds for possession. That would happen as soon as a tenant made a complaint, sought a reference to a rent assessment committee or considered initiating legal proceedings. If there were to be a possession hearing, the court would have to inquire about the landlord's motives under new subsection (d). That would be an extremely difficult exercise for the court to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the court could grant possession, it would have to be satisfied that what had taken place during the tenancy had not wholly or partly motivated the landlord to seek possession. That could create some considerable problems. As I have said, it would put the court in the difficult position of having to try to establish the motivies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to try to prevent the Under-Secretary from going too far down that road. Such measures are applied in other countries. For example, in New South Wales, under a deregulatory system, the housing court can take such matters into account. If a landlord is motivated by spite, he will not be allowed to evict the tenant on those grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to see the legal provisions of New South Wales and find out how the law is drafted there. My understanding of this country's legal system is that those who draft laws have advisedly attempted not to use the word "motive" as an ingredient of any element of either criminal offences or civil proceedings because someone's motive is difficult to establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that often—some might say almost always—we do not have a single motive; we often act out of mixed motives. The new clause would allow a court to consider any mixed motive. It would put landlords in a difficult position, especially if their tenants were litigious, apt to complain or fastidious. If such tenants were to complain, landlords would find it difficult to regain possession because they could not rely wholly on statutory grounds for possession as the courts would consider their motives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords might well want to obtain possession at the end of a fixed term for reasons of their own. All tenants
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
who have entered into such fixed-term contracts are aware that their tenancies can cease at the end of a fixed period. However, both assured tenancies and assured shorthold tenancies could be prolonged because landlords' motives could be put under consideration. If the matter were to come to court, which landlord could put his hand on his heart and say that the fact that the tenant made complaints or took the matter to a rent assessment committee did not influence his motives and played no part in his thinking? So the new clause would put landlords in a difficult position. It would create considerable uncertainty, as would previous Opposition amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition amendments have not shown sufficient concern for the clear legal framework that has been put in place for assured tenancies and assured shorthold tenancies, which has enabled the private rented sector to flourish. If we were to accept the new clause, we should go back to complexity, additional regulation and—I hate to tell the Committee this, but it is my instinct—a great deal of work for lawyers. The new clause would do more for the health of the legal profession than for the health of the private rented sector, so I advise the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If only on the basis of not providing more work for lawyers, I shall withdraw the motion. Before doing so, I ask the Under-Secretary to reconsider the effect that such a new clause would have, even if he cannot accept the present wording of the new clause. The private rented sector is not flourishing—at least, it is not providing the quality that we want tenants to have. Far too many people live in dangerous or unsafe conditions, or pay excessive rents and face all the other problems that have been mentioned by the Committee. We must re-examine the matter because it is one in which environmental health officers and advice agencies are interested. They want redress for tenants to be established. On the basis that we do not want to provide any further work for lawyers at present, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PAYMENT OF HOUSING BENEFIT TO THIRD PARTIES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 360, in page 52, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In section 5 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (regulations about claims for and payment of benefit) at the end of subsection (l)(h) insert 'and, as regards the administration of housing benefit, for requiring a request for information or evidence by the determining authority to be made in such a manner and within such a period as may be prescribed, not being more than seven days from the date on which the claim is received at the appropriate office of the Department of Social Security or at the designated office, whichever is the earlier'.".</p></blockquote>
We now come to part IV of the Bill, which deals with housing benefit. It is a curious benefit, and the subject of split responsibility, wherein lie many problems. The responsibility for shaping the benefit, determining the regulations, the amount of entitlement and so on, all lie with the Department of Social Security, whereas the administrative responsibility lies with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we are considering the administrative clauses relating to housing benefit. Because of the split, we cannot table amendments to tackle some of the very serious problems in the benefits system, such as the deep poverty traps, the steep withdrawal of benefit as income rises, disincentives and so on that are widely recognised to be intrinsic problems of means-testing. Nor can we attempt to reverse the unfair and discriminatory cuts in entitlement to benefit affecting young single people that will come into effect later this year or the withdrawal of entitlement from many asylum seekers that became effective last month and which has caused widespread concern and hardship. Unfortunately, the remit of the Bill and your chairmanship, Mrs. Winterton, ensures that we cannot debate such amendments today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead we must confine ourselves to the administration of housing benefit, which also concerns us and has caused many problems since the scheme was first introduced in 1982. The rushed—many would say bungled—implementation of the scheme, resulted in chaos, involving many thousands, if not millions of claimants waiting an inordinate length of time for their benefit entitlement. That led 
	<i>The Times</i> to describe the scheme as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The worst administrative fiasco in the history of the welfare state".</p></blockquote>
That forced a review of the system and further changes in 1987 and 1988, but problems still continue. The Audit Commission produced a report two and a half years ago entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Remote Control: The National Administration of Housing Benefit"</p></blockquote>
which highlights many of those problems. I shall refer briefly to some of the issues identified by the Audit Commission. It said that the performance of some authorities had been criticised by volunteer bodies, academics, landlords and individual claimants. Some academics and others argued that problems with housing benefit were a major factor preventing homeless, young, single people from obtaining permanent rented accommodation in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which has provided us with much useful evidence is reported by the Audit Commission as saying:
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The quality of service being provided by many local authorities throughout the country in administering housing benefit is inadequate at almost every level".</p></blockquote>
Research was published by the Housing Corporation—I am almost reluctant to mention this as it was conducted by the company that I used to run before being elected to my present position. I declared an interest, but of course, it is all in the past. That research found that
	<br><blockquote><p>"whilst the overall picture is not uniformly bad, the scale and range of problems [with HB administration] found by the study strongly indicates a major barrier towards [housing] associations achieving the expectations placed upon them by the Government's current and future housing policies".</p></blockquote>
The local government ombudsman found serious shortcomings in some authorities' operations. For example, investigations revealed
	<br><blockquote><p>"a deplorable catalogue of failure … and at times nothing short of administrative chaos … serious failures in the way Housing and Community Charge Benefit are administered"</p></blockquote>
and that failures caused Mr. X
	<br><blockquote><p>"gross injustice in that he lost his home and possessions".</p></blockquote>
There we have a clear statement from the Audit Commission that the administrative problems continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment focuses on the length of time that it takes a local authority to process a housing benefit claim. In theory, the local authority is required to process the claim within 14 days. Responding to a debate on another subject on Tuesday, the Undersecretary made the valid comment that, according to official statistics, 80 per cent, of claims were determined within 14 days. That, of course, is an admission of failure because, by definition, if only 80 per cent, are processed within 14 days, one in five are not. That is unsatisfactory, given that we are dealing with people who desperately need that money to pay their rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a more serious issue. The 14-day rule bites only from the time that the local authority has all the information necessary to process the claim. In many cases it takes a great deal longer than 14 days—in some cases it may take months—for the local authority to gather that information together. In some cases that may be because of the claimant's failure to provide it. More often, it is because of the need to co-ordinate information between the local authority and the Department of Social Security, or to get verification from employers about income data supplied by the claimant and to carry out a serious of outside checks. Those checks are perfectly proper, but the amendment addresses the crucial point that no time scale is imposed on the local authority to ensure that the process is conducted expeditiously. There is no requirement for it to be completed within a specified time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, as I mentioned, a requirement that once the authority has all the information, it should process the claim within 14 days, but as I said, it could be months before that information is gathered, so the 14-day period is overruled by the fact that the authority does not have the necessary information. The Audit Commission confirms that and points out that in many cases it is a real cause of delays, which result in people waiting a disproportionate length of time before they receive their benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux highlighted the problem and one particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
case, which I think the Committee should hear. It illustrates how grievous the problem can be. A citizens advice bureaux in the south-east described a housing benefit claim fiasco that one of its clients experienced. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Following CAB assistance with claiming Income Support, housing benefit and council tax, the client returned to the bureau seven weeks later to say that he still had not received any housing benefit"—</p></blockquote>
Seven weeks later. The account continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The bureau phoned the housing benefit department and was told that the benefit forms were now out of date. Following a series of phone calls the client was asked to go to the housing benefit department in order to make a claim. Three weeks later, the unfortunate man returned to the bureau stating that he had still not received any housing benefit. The CAB rang the department requesting that the payment be made urgently. Three weeks later the client had still not received any money."</p></blockquote>
That was 13 weeks beyond the initial point. The case goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the last occasion, the CAB again rang the housing benefit department and was told that they were awaiting information from the DSS concerning the man's income support claim."—</p></blockquote>
That is the classic problem, when the local authority must wait for information from a Government Department—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CAB reminded the department that they had promised to treat the case urgently and that the man had now not received housing benefit for over two months."</p></blockquote>
By my calculation, that should read "over three months", but perhaps there is a glitch there that I have not spotted. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They were assured that money would be sent out by the end of the week. The CAB advised the man of this and told him to come back to the bureau if he had not received his money. In the words of the CAB: 'the client returned, unbelievably, he had still not been sent any money,' All in all the client had to wait four months whilst the local authority processed his claim, without the intervention of the CAB he may well have had to wait much longer."</p></blockquote>
Such administrative delays, while the local authority and the Department of Social Security fail to get their act together, are totally unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This simple and straightforward amendment is designed to tackle those delays by imposing a seven-day requirement on the obtaining of information. There is a 14-day requirement on processing the case, but there is no requirement on gathering information. We believe that a seven-day requirement on the authority to gather the necessary information would inject discipline and a proper sense of urgency into the processing of people's benefit entitlement. I sincerely hope that the Minister will agree that the amendment is sensible and practical and that it would deal with one of the key problems in the administration of housing benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that the amendment would speed up the claims process so that benefit was made available to claimants more quickly. Unfortunately, the amendment would have the opposite effect. Authorities would have only one opportunity to obtain all the information needed to determine and maintain a claim. If they failed to request any item of information no matter how important, within the statutory seven days, they would either have to do without or press ahead with a request for which
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
there was no statutory backing. In the event of the latter, the claimant would arguably be within his or her rights to refuse to co-operate. Faced with that dilemma, an authority could determine the claim only on the basis of the available evidence, which might result in benefit being overpaid or underpaid, or in the claim being rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties would not end there. Once the seven days had elapsed, a local authority would not be able to seek information in connection with any subsequent review of a claimant's circumstances. Instead, the authority would have to rely entirely on the claimant's reporting every relevant change correctly. The consequences of such a course and the opportunities it presents for fraudulent claims are unthinkable. I do not believe that that is the outcome that Labour Members want, but I see no alternative if the amendment is agreed to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already measures in place to help speed up the claims process, including demanding targets that staff must meet in connection with the determination of claims and reported changes of circumstances. As has been accepted, most claims are dealt with promptly, but delays sometimes occur which are not necessarily the fault of the local authority staff. It is important to bear in mind, therefore, the fact that laying down procedures in law may hinder, rather than improve efficient operation, not least because of the counter-productive effect of the amendment. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy to accept that the amendment may contain technical deficiencies. Labour Members are not proud, and we have not had problems in accepting ministerial requests to rewrite our amendments. I would be happy to accept such an offer from the Under-Secretary, but I am not happy to accept that nothing can be done. It is unacceptable that people should have to wait for as long as the citizens advice bureau described. I suspect that all Members of Parliament have heard similar stories from constituents, who have had to wait a disproportionate time for their claims to be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary was prepared to say that he would think about the matter, and try to give greater speed and urgency to the process, I would happily withdraw the amendment, but he must do more than say that it is technically deficient. There is a serious problem; the system is not working well. There is, in theory, a 14-day obligation, but that is not satisfied in at least one in five cases. In some cases, there may be other factors, but, as I said, those cases are not part of the one in five, because the obligation does not come into effect until the authority has all the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share with the hon. Gentleman the desire that the service to housing benefit claimants should be as speedy and efficient as possible. In general, I hope that we would all strive to achieve that objective. However, one factor that is germane to the debate has not been mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. If, through no fault of the claimant, an authority cannot make a determination within 14 days, it is under an obligation to make a payment on account. We do not know whether that happened in the example given by the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for speaking of payments on account, which is provided for in the housing benefit regulations. The difficulty almost always arises when the information sought relates to the income of the claimant, particularly if the figures have to be checked with the employer or, for self-employed claimants, with the accountant. The authorities are reluctant to make interim payments in such circumstances because if discrepancies arise, overpayments might be difficult to recover. Authorities often have that problem when administering housing benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the problem is not that the authority has to check with accountants, but that the vast majority of self-employed claimants are not earning sufficient to employ an accountant? The self-employed therefore find it extremely difficult to find someone to certify their accounts. That can go on for a long time. On Tuesday, when my hon. Friend was away, I referred to self-employed pizza deliverers. Such people find making claims extremely difficult; because they are on low incomes and are not paid on time, they suffer hardship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. Although I was not present on Tuesday because of another pressing engagement, I have read 
	<i>Hansard.</i> I read my hon. Friend's reference to whether his constituent delivered 30 or 28 pizzas a day—a question affecting his earnings and therefore his entitlement to benefit. Those are genuine and practical problems. The provision for making interim payments cannot always be used because of the fear of overpayment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem remains. We are unhappy at the Government's response. It is a key issue and should be dealt with urgently as part of the review of housing benefit. I hope that the Under-Secretary will at least communicate to his colleagues in the Department of Social Security our unhappiness on the matter and will seek to find practical ways of speeding up the process and avoiding the sort of problem that is, sadly, too often brought to our attention. However, bearing in mind the need to make progress and the wish to deal with several other matters today, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 361, in page 52, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In subsection (l)(k) of section 5 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 at the end insert 'provided that where a claimant is on income support and has included in the calculation of his applicable amount, the pensioner, the enhanced pensioner or the higher pensioner premium or, although not himself in receipt thereof, has included in the calculation of his applicable amount the pensioner, the enhanced pensioner or the higher pensioner premium, the award of housing benefit shall be made for an indefinite period.'."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
The amendment has a similar effect to amendment No. 360. It relates to the period of time during which a pensioner can receive housing benefit before a review of benefit entitlement is required. Present housing benefit regulations require claims to be renewed every year. A little latitude is allowed for late submissions, but new applications are expected to be made once a year. For most non-pensioner households, that is not only necessary, it is desirable. It is important that the housing benefit administering authority should have a regular overview of people's circumstances, to check that their entitlement is correct and as a safeguard against fraud. We have no difficulty in accepting the normal pattern. However, that does not apply for pensioner households. Most pensioners' circumstances do not change, except for the annual uprating of their benefit entitlement. The need for a lengthy and complicated process of reapplying for benefit every year is therefore rather superfluous and can lead to serious problems. For example, a pensioner who goes away for a period—who goes to visit relatives or has been hospitalised—and fails to return the form can face the serious position of having benefit suspended because the authority has not received a reapplication within the requisite period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all members of the Committee will be aware of cases in their constituencies in which a confused pensioner simply forgets to fill in or to return the form, or does not think it necessary to do so because he or she has filled in the form the previous year. We have all come across cases of people who have got into difficulty through either an omission on their part or a failure by the authority that has resulted in their not making a renewal claim within the requisite period. As a result, their benefit is suspended. In the most serious cases, that in turn leads to their receiving a notice that possession is sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us have encountered people who are desperate and ask, "Why am I about to lose my home when I have not done anything wrong? I thought that housing benefit was covering my rent." Usually, with the intervention of a Member of Parliament or a councillor, such cases can satisfactorily be sorted out and eviction prevented, although the people concerned have in the meantime suffered considerable personal anguish. However, in some cases that do not come to our attention until too late, people end up losing their home or getting into serious debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Under-Secretary will know, there is a time limit on the ability of local authorities to backdate benefit. If the benefit has been underpaid or unpaid for more that a year—even in cases of severe hardship or the most pressing extenuating circumstances—authorities cannot legally make a backdated payment, and the people concerned are left in serious debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, we believe it is right to review this bureaucratic requirement. I hope that Ministers, who often argue the case for deregulation, will see the merit of a more flexible approach that removes a bureaucratic requirement for annual renewal of applications for benefit by pensioners. We do not suggest that that approach should apply to claimants across the board; we propose it only for pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
The amendment would not fetter local authorities' discretion to carry out regular reviews if they wanted to. There may be good reason in many cases involving lonely elderly people for the authority trying to keep in regular touch with them; there may be good reason for making regular checks in order to maximise benefit entitlement, but that should not be an obligation in every case. It creates unnecessary paperwork and can lead to problems. The amendment proposes a sensible simple administrative reform that would lead to a smoother administration of housing benefit for many pensioners and remove the threat of serious debt or, in the worst cases, eviction, from some unfortunate people who—often through no fault of their own—are unable to comply with the present bureaucratic requirements. I hope that the Under-Secretary will feel able to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have previously consulted local authorities and asked them to provide evidence for improvements in administrative efficiency that would result from easements similar to that proposed by the hon. Gentleman. I have to tell him that evidence produced by local authorities has been inconclusive. It showed that there had been overpayments and that some local authorities even prefer to set shorter benefit periods than the six-week maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remain unconvinced that any administrative easement following a move to continuous awards would justify the cost involved in identifying the relevant cases. Such a move may result in overpayments which would have subsidy implications for local authorities. As the hon. Gentleman said, claimants could suffer from less frequent reviews of their entitlement—that might result in underpayments for which claimants would not be fully reimbursed. As the hon. Gentleman said, the 52-week limit on paying arrears or being asked to refund overpayments—which will have long been spent—will be to claimants' disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, in fact, there were no requirement for a renewal at the end of 12 months, that position would not arise. There would be no requirement for the authority to suspend benefit if it had not received a renewal form. Therefore, the circumstances whereby people could get into such difficulties would not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would not always be the case. A recent survey shows a higher rate in the payments for pensioners. The period of 60 weeks enables them to pick up on the 52-week rule. Far from making the lives of pensioners easier, the move to indefinite benefit periods may result in increased distress. Often, such a provision could be to their disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not understand the Under-Secretary's last response to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), who said that if there were no need for the annual review, there would not be a problem of having to suspend payments because people had not returned the forms. The Under-Secretary then went into an explanation about 52 weeks and 60 weeks, which I did not follow. Perhaps he could explain the position again to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was acknowledging what the hon. Member for Greenwich had said about the limitation and that any underpayment could not be made good before 52 weeks. The longer the situation goes on, the more likely it is that any underpayment cannot be made good. The opportunity of the period of 60 weeks provides the way to go back on the 52 weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logic of the Under-Secretary's case is that we should review the position of pensioners every six months, in case a mistake was made when they applied the first time. That is illogical. It is important to get the position right the first time and not to keep repeating the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That can happen in practice, given the discretion of local authorities that prefer to set shorter benefit periods. In the same spirit as the hon. Member for Greenwich, the Government have asked how the situation might be improved. The evidence that we received was inconclusive. I must point out that there is no need for renewal claim forms to be onerous. Local authorities have the discretion to use simplified claim forms that could reduce problems and not require information that is already available to be repeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is about to shoot himself in the foot. The more simple the form is made, the less likely it is that an anomaly that might have been missed the first time will be found.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that argument. Simplicity is in the interests of ensuring that a review is less onerous and does not require information having to be repeated; people can simply state that the circumstances have not changed. The hon. Member for Greenwich is calling for more deregulation and the common ground between is that we should be improving best practice and consulting further with local authorities about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just shot himself in his other foot. He referred to the use of simpler forms and said that, when circumstances have not changed, there is no need for a complicated form. If circumstances have not changed, there is no need for a review. If they have, a simple form will not pick that up and the right information will not be provided. What is the point of a simple form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is every point in it. If the form says that there has been no change in the details, the matter will not be pursued. Pensioners' details can change frequently. The hon. Member for Greenwich said that repayments of underpayments can be made for up to 52 weeks. That is the difficulty, but simplified forms eliminate unnecessary duplication. That does not present a problem, and the hon. Member for Sheffield Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) is wrong to suggest that it would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that local authorities have the discretion to use simplified forms to reduce the burden on persons making the claim and not to go through the

	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely confused about what the Under-Secretary is saying. I am sure that people outside the House want to know the purpose of the review.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A review at a later time will primarily consider the circumstances then ensure that what is being done is appropriate and right, and that there are neither overpayments nor underpayments. In the interests of trying to make the process easier for not only claimants but local authorities, they have discretion to use simplified forms. I am sure that we all want that to be used appropriately so that people do not have to undertake the onerous task of going through every piece of information again when it might be possible simply to state that there has been no change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I moved the amendment, I stressed that it would not preclude an authority contacting an elderly person more frequently if it felt that there was good reason for doing so. That would be good practice and it could involve the authority issuing the sort of form that the Under-Secretary described, which could say, "If there is any change of circumstance, please let us know."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that, under the amendment, the failure to return that form would not legally require the authority to suspend payment of benefit. The authority could continue to pay benefit while further investigating the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing for changes that would simplify the procedure, give more flexibility and cut out unnecessary paperwork. The authority would be free to decide whether to use the simplified form that the Undersecretary suggested. If the authority did not receive a reply from an individual, it would not be forced to suspend benefit, as it would be at present. Surely, the Under-Secretary can understand the benefit of such a more flexible framework, which would avoid the cases of hardship to which I referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there is an appropriate, flexible framework at present. I should like more to be done to use simplified forms to complete reviews where appropriate. That would ensure that there is no underpayment or overpayment. We think equally of the liability on the taxpayer as of the problems created for claimants because of not being able to go back more than 52 weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary seems to be making much of this simple matter. There is undoubtedly a problem, especially for pensioners who become extremely worried by it. Those of us who have sat on housing benefit review boards know that elderly people, who loathe to get into debt, can suddenly
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
discover that they are in debt. As the matter is so simple, I cannot understand why the Under-Secretary is against dealing with it. He has said that he wants to review it and that local authorities might be able to send out another sort of note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the fact that there is a problem, the amendment—or something similar—should be accepted, with the proviso that local authorities do not lose contact with such people forever. As the Undersecretary said, local authorities could send some sort of simple letter to pensioners to ask, "Can you just confirm whether your circumstances have changed?" If that were done once a year, it would not fall foul of the 52-week rule. Doing something about the matter would give peace of mind to many elderly people. We know that some of them have suffered dreadful trauma because, for the first time in their lives, they have got into debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 362, in page 52, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) At the end of subsection (l)(o) of section 5 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1992 there shall be inserted the words 'together with, in prescribed circumstances relating to housing benefit, interest accumulated upon the amount withheld'.".</p></blockquote>
This is a very simple amendment. When benefit has been withheld—I shall explain circumstances in which an authority may withhold benefit—and is subsequently released, it would be paid together with interest accumulated on the sum withheld. Under the housing benefit regulations, the local authority can withhold benefit if it believes that the tenant is not using it to pay rent due to the landlord. The most obvious circumstance of that applying is when the landlord and tenant are in dispute about repairs that have not been carried out. Under the usual provisions, it would be appropriate for the tenant to withhold rent as a sanction against the landlord for failing to meet his obligations. In such a situation, the tenant's remedy is damaged to some extent by the authority's ability to withhold benefit, because if the authority withholds benefit and the tenant is subsequently required to pay the rent, although he may receive the payment later, no interest will be paid on it, and he may well be out of pocket as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a significant High Court judgment in the case of Kensington and Chelsea ex parte Brandt last year, in which there was a dispute between landlord and tenant and the council exercised its power to withhold housing benefit pending resolution of the dispute. The tenant asked that the withheld benefit should be placed in an interest-bearing account because the dispute was taking years to resolve, but the court decided that there was no power by which the council could agree to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not arguing that that will happen in many cases, but in a situation where the authority sees the case for withholding benefit, it should have the power to place the money in an interest-bearing account, rather than simply withholding it. The amendment would make such an arrangement possible. It is a modest amendment, which I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate much of what the hon. Gentleman says, but the case that he describes is not the only one in which benefit might be withheld. It might be helpful if I remind the Committee of the circumstances in which benefit can be withheld by local authorities. That is done where there is doubt about a person's continuing entitlement to benefit—for example, to combat benefit fraud, when the local authority has sound evidence that the claimant is in full-
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
time work. That evidence must be referred to the adjudication officer at the Benefits Agency. Usually, benefit is withheld only until the matter has been resolved. Regulations require the matter to be reviewed within six weeks and payment revised, refused or reinstated, including the payment of any outstanding arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing benefit can be withheld for a longer period where there is evidence that a claimant is failing to pay his rent, or where it is in his overriding interest not to make direct payments to the landlord. That is exactly the situation that the hon. Gentleman has in mind, where there is a dispute between the tenant and his landlord. As he said, such occasions are rare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those measure are necessary to protect public funds and to prevent abuse. It is not a matter of local authorities acting unreasonably or denying people benefit that is righly theirs. In the circumstances that I described, the taxpayer should not be expected to pay interest to claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me equally is that the amendment would impose more onerous obligations on local authorities, which would discourage them from fulfilling their responsibilities as the stewards of taxpayers' money. Although I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument as it applies to that rare instance, I fear that the amendment would go far too wide. It should not be pursued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Under-Secretary saying that he would encourage local authorities to withhold benefit? While they were withholding it, they—rather than the tenant—would get the interest on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One might try to make an argument along those lines, but of course all the costs would fall back on the taxpayer. For every benefit apparent, there is a corresponding counter-benefit, so it would be difficult to argue that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the significance of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Greenwich. I want to reflect on how to deal with it, but it is so rare that I am worried about the overall consequences of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister studies our amendment with care, he will see that it would insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"together with, in prescribed circumstances relating to housing benefit, interest accumulated upon the amount withheld".</p></blockquote>
The amendment does not require interest to be added in all circumstances. It would simply allow the Secretary of State for Social Security to prescribe by regulations the circumstances in which interest could be added. It would not impose an unreasonable obligation on local authorities. It deals with a problem highlighted in the court case that I referred to, and would remedy the injustices that can apply in individual cases. I am surprised and disappointed that the Minister will not accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not want to accept the amendment, I concede that the hon. Gentleman has raised a significant matter in mentioning those rare cases, and I am certainly prepare to consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
that further. However, I remind him that some local authorities, in their responsibilities for the administration of housing benefit and for arrangements of compensation, will offer compensation in certain circumstances, but the consequences are for them and their local taxpayers to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An individual might seek to involve the ombudsman, who might direct the local authority to compensate that person if there has been maladministration. So there may be other openings through which the problem to which the hon. Gentleman refers can be dealt with, but the amendment does not offer the right way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Under-Secretary's point that, in a case of maladministration, the ombudsman can propose that the authority make compensation. However, when the case involves simply adding interest, my understanding of the judgment in the case of Kensington and Chelsea v. ex parte Brandt is that the court decided that the council had no power to agree to that. In such cases, there is a clear blockage against remedying an injustice. I am grateful to the Undersecretary for agreeing to consider that matter and, given that offer, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) At the end of subsection (1) of section 5 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 there shall be inserted the words—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(s) for the making of interim payments of housing benefit to Crown tenants until their entitlement to help with housing costs under any voluntary scheme operated by their landlord or under the income support scheme is established.'."</p></blockquote>
We now come to an extraordinary saga, Mrs. Winterton, and I beg your indulgence and that of the Committee, as it will take some time to outline the circumstances of those who are not receiving any benefit because of a lacuna in the regulations. The case involves tenants of Greenwich hospital, who are my constituents. Many hon. Members will know of that institution, which is the landlord of the fine buildings in Greenwich currently occupied by the Royal Naval college, which, for a variety of reasons, have recently been a focus of attention. The hospital no longer operates as a hospital, but it did when it was established more than 300 years ago and it still bears the name. It administers a substantial amount of property in the Greenwich area, including some tenanted residential property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 19 June last summer, it was brought to my attention that some of the tenants living in property occupied by Greenwich hospital were no longer receiving housing benefit because the local authority, having checked the housing benefit regulations, had concluded that it was not entitled to pay housing benefit because the tenants were Crown tenants. That is only the beginning of the story; were it the end, we would not be in the position that we are in now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the matter up with the Secretary of State for Defence, who is the sole trustee of Greenwich hospital and whose name appears on the tenancy agreement as
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
the landlord. I told him that the local authority was prevented by law from paying housing benefit, although it had been making payments. I pointed out that the normal procedure for Crown tenants is for the relevant Government Department to make the payments. I went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As you are the landlord of these premises, I would have thought that your department should accept the responsibility."</p></blockquote>
I had discussed the case with Greenwich hospital, and so I also wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I understand that Greenwich Hospital Estates may be seeking an exemption from this provision. If so this would clearly affect the situation … In the meantime however I hope that you will agree to assume responsibility in respect"</p></blockquote>
of the particular tenants. The letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We clearly cannot allow them to be left in the lurch while Greenwich Hospital and the DSS continue to discuss the possibility of an exemption."</p></blockquote>
I concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you cannot agree to do this, I hope that you will reach an agreement with"</p></blockquote>
the Secretary of State for Social Security,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to whom I am copying this letter, that his Department will do so."</p></blockquote>
That was on 22 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 17 July, I received a reply.from the Ministry of Defence. I shall quote parts of it, because the Committee should know how complex it is. In it, Earl Howe, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence expressed his concern on hearing about the unfortunate position that the tenants were in and noted that they did not qualify for benefit because of that technicality. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should explain that the Secretary of State is named on the … lease as the landlord in his capacity as sole Trustee of Greenwich Hospital, the Crown Charity, rather than as the Minister for a Government Department which is resourced from voted public funds.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If Greenwich Hospital were a Government Department, it is likely that the replacement of the removed Housing Benefit would be met from Departmental voted public funds. However, Greenwich Hospital is not funded from public sources, but separately endowed. This endowment provides the dividend and rental income which it uses to pursue its charitable aims.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>What Greenwich Hospital cannot do is give its tenants a permanent subsidy, because such an action would breach its duty under its Charter to apply all of its charity giving to seafarers and their dependants. Similarly it could not permanently waive a proportion of the correctly assessed rent due from a tenant, because Greenwich Hospital has the legal duty to obtain the best income it can from its property and other investments."</p></blockquote>
That paragraph is important and germane. The letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the … landlord, Greenwich Hospital has taken several steps to try to help them and any other of its residential tenants who are, or may be, placed in the same position. It has made representations and advanced arguments to the Department of Social Security (DSS) over a lengthy period, and tried to persuade that Department that its regulations should provide an exemption for Greenwich Hospital."</p></blockquote>
Earl Howe ended his letter by stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Negotiations with the DSS continue. Greenwich Hospital is pressing the DSS for a speedy solution to this problem, and I hope to be able to pass on more positive news as quickly as possible."</p></blockquote>
That letter was dated 17 July. I responded on 24 July, trusting that the matter would be pursued without further delay. My letter of 24 July must have crossed with one from Earl Howe to me about a separate case, involving another tenant in the same circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 28 July, I received a letter from the Undersecretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans), expressing his wish to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
resolve the social security position of Greenwich hospital estate tenants. He expressed regret that
	<br><blockquote><p>"this has taken longer than we would like as the information that we have received about the status of Greenwich Hospital tenants is insufficent to establish whether the Crown tenant exclusion from Housing Benefit should be applied."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unfortunately the position regarding Greenwich Hospital tenants is not clear cut. The fact that their tenancy agreements are signed on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence would appear to indicate that Greenwich Hospital is part of the Ministry of Defence and the Crown tenant exclusion is appropriate.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>However, it is also possible that Greenwich Hospital is independent of the Ministry of Defence and that the Secretary of State for Defence's role as trustee of Greenwich Hospital is filled in a personal capacity created by the need to find a legal successor to the Admiralty Lords who previously fulfilled these functions. If this is the case it would clearly be inappropriate to exclude Greenwich Hospital tenants from Housing Benefit.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>My officials are taking steps to resolve this matter with both the Ministry of Defence Land Service and the Greenwich Hospital Estate. I am aware of the urgency of the situation and we will seek to resolve the matter as soon as possible after receiving the required information."</p></blockquote>
That letter was dated 28 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 14 August, I received a further letter from Earl Howe, confirming that meetings had taken place between the director of Greenwich hospital and the DSS. He ended his letter by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"DSS officials have been asked to study the papers given to them as a matter of urgency."</p></blockquote>
On 23 October, I heard again from the Department of Social Security. The Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You are aware that our lawyers are currently considering the extensive legal documentation provided in support of your assertion that your tenants should not properly be described as Crown tenants."</p></blockquote>
I did not argue that they should not properly be described as Crown tenants; I argued simply that they should not be put in an impossible situation where no one could determine their status. However, that was the interpretation of my comments made by the Undersecretary of State. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These papers raise a number of complex legal points which will unfortunately take a while to consider. Nevertheless, I would like to reassure you that the matter has not been forgotten."</p></blockquote>
That letter was dated 23 October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 6 November, I received another letter from Earl Howe at the Ministry of Defence, who explained that there had been a meeting between Greenwich hospital and senior Department of Social Security officials
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a view to clarifying whether Greenwich Hospital tenants were eligible for Housing Benefit."</p></blockquote>
He referred to the letter that I had received from the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans). Earl Howe wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I too shall let you know the outcome of the DSS's deliberation as soon as possible."</p></blockquote>
I shall not quote from all the letters that I had sent before, but on 8 November, I replied to Earl Howe in exasparation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It does seem to me extraordinary that it is taking so long to sort out a relatively simple issue—namely which Government department"—</p></blockquote>
the Ministry of Defence or the Department of Social Security—
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"is responsible for rent allowances to tenants of Greenwich Hospital."</p></blockquote>
On 6 December, Earl Howe replied, saying that he appreciated my concern and that he had written to the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the Minister responsible for Housing Benefit policy, asking him to let me know as soon as possible his Department's view on whether Greenwich Hospital tenants are eligible for Housing Benefit."</p></blockquote>
We are three months on, and the matter has still not been sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a disgraceful case of incompetence, buck-passing and indecision by Government, and it is time that it was sorted out. The amendment would sort it out simply by saying that there should be provision for making
	<br><blockquote><p>"interim payments of housing benefit to Crown tenants until their entitlement to help with housing costs under any voluntary scheme operated by their landlord or under the income support scheme is established".</p></blockquote>
In response to an earlier amendment, the Undersecretary raised the issue of interim payments and said that we need not pursue the matter of people who do not get benefit, because there is provision for interim payments. There is no current provision for interim payments for those unfortunate people. They are caught in a bureaucratic nightmare in which no one will accept responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Officials from the relevant Departments have been pushing paper backwards and forwards without resolving the problem for more than six months. The problem must be resolved, and I hope that the Undersecretary will not make feeble excuses about why the amendment should not be accepted. I hope that he will pass on to his colleagues in the Departments concerned his dissatisfaction—as well as mine—at the extraordinarily inefficient way in which the whole matter has been addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to add the briefest of footnotes to the remarkable narrative of the hon. Member for Greenwich. I was once the Paymaster General. The office of Paymaster General was created in 1836, as a result of bringing together the office of Treasurer of the Admiralty under Henry VIII, the Paymaster General of the Guards, Garrisons and Land Forces under Cromwell and, under Charles II, the Paymaster and Treasurer of the Royal hospital, Chelsea and the Treasurer of the Ordinance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Paymaster General had responsibility for the Royal hospital at Greenwich, as he has for the Royal hospital at Chelsea, the problem that the hon. Gentleman describes would not have arisen, because the Paymaster General's Department is a Crown Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have special sympathy for the hon. Gentleman, because, as Paymaster General, I was also treasurer of the Royal Patriotic Fund—a remarkable body. When its annual report was produced, no reference was made to the fact that its treasurer was the Paymaster General, and it took us about six months to persuade it that, if the Paymaster General held that office, he should fulfil it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know how difficult these matters are; they go back a long way. On the basis of the hon. Gentleman's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
narrative, I hope that the Government will respond constructively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Greenwich, who has kindly passed me a copy of the correspondence to which he referred. I am aware of the problem that he describes, in which a landlord owning property in his constituency is reluctant to administer a rebate scheme for tenants that it believes to be Crown tenants. I understand that steps are being taken to clarify the position as soon as possible, but it is for local authorities to determine whether the people in question are Crown tenants. The fact that they have been so determined excludes them from housing benefit. It would not be appropriate to subvert that determination by making payments of housing benefit on account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the frustration to which the hon. Gentleman refers dates back several months, but I understand that Departments have had to go through papers dating from 1692. It appears to be a more than usually involved case. I suggest that the proper action is to press landlords to rebate rent for Crown tenants who fall outside the income support scheme, but who need help to meet their rent. I am pleased to hear that Greenwich hospital—the landlord—is currently rebating rent for its tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not immediately apparent how the amendment would benefit Crown tenants. Interim payments are made on the basis that they are recoverable, so Crown tenants would have to repay those payments when the correct source of assistance was established. That would create additional administrative tasks for local authorities. I am not aware of administrative problems that delay payment of income support housing costs to Crown tenants. The only people who would benefit from a new provision are landlords who would have an incentive to defer—possibly indefinitely—the operation of a voluntary rebate scheme, while secure in the knowledge that payments of housing benefit on account would safeguard cashflow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that that is the outcome that the hon. Member for Greenwich wants to achieve. He is focusing proper attention on the matter and I feel sure that my colleagues will want to find the right solution at the earliest possible opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary expresses hope that his colleagues will respond because attention is being focused on the matter. I have been focusing attention on it since 22 June. I have a huge bundle of correspondence—a copy of which I passed to the Minister—with the Department of Social Security and the Ministry of Defence, none of which has produced a result. I hope that the Under-Secretary has more influence than me. It is unacceptable for people to be left in limbo for that length of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary rightly says that, at present, Greenwich hospital is not insisting mat tenants pay their full rent. It is forgoing its expected rent, but the Undersecretary will recall that I read out a letter from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence stressing that Greenwich hospital was unable to give its
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
tenants a permanent subsidy. The letter states that Greenwich hospital
	<br><blockquote><p>"could not permanently waive a proportion of the correctly assessed rent"</p></blockquote>
because of its charitable status. While it has done so to date, if the matter remains unresolved—there is no sign of it being resolved at present—there will come a point when Greenwich hospital has to assist on the money. The tenants will then be left in an impossible position with no means of meeting their rents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall take the Under-Secretary up on his kind offer to write to his colleagues.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 333, in page 52, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In section 63 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (adjudication of housing benefit), in subsection (3) for the word 'reviews' the words 'appeals to social security appeal tribunals' shall be substituted.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to replace the current system of reviewing decisions on housing benefit with the right to an independent appeal. The existing appeal structure for housing benefit review boards seems to be a bit of an anomaly within the social security system. The boards have been criticised both for their professional conduct and for their lack of independence, which is more important. They are made up of local councillors making decisions on their own councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Social Security has commissioned research on how housing benefit review boards work, which supports the view that social security appeals tribunals, rather than the boards, should deal with appeals. However, the Department states that that cannot be done because it would need primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been recent changes to housing benefit, some of which the Committee has discussed; others might be discussed later today. Many of those changes will mean that housing benefit review boards have an even greater volume of work, much of which will be more complex. That is one of the reasons why we must consider such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall remind those who are not familiar with the system how it came about. The means-tested benefit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
system was reformed under the Social Security Act 1986 to try to achieve better integration. Although local authorities administer housing benefit, the rules under which it operates are similar to other means-tested benefits. However, the appeals procedure remains completely different, possibly because local authorities had schemes for rent rebates prior to 1982, which were administered locally. Social security tribunals hear income support and family credit appeals, but local review boards, which are made up of councillors and make decisions about their local authority, deal with housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been sustained criticism of the way in which review boards operate for several years. Therefore, in 1991 the Government commissioned research from the University of York into the structure of housing benefit review boards and the options for change. The report found that there were many problems with the system, including a perceived lack of independence and delays in arranging hearings. It found also that board members behaved unprofessionally and lacked knowledge. The researchers concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our view there have to be powerful arguments why housing benefit claimants should be treated differently in any fundamental way from other social security claimants. We do not find the arguments in favour of different treatment persuasive. There are not sufficient differences between either the content or the administration of housing benefit and other benefits to suggest that appeals on housing benefit should be treated substantially differently."</p></blockquote>
In response to the report, the Department of Social Security introduced some administrative changes and produced a guidance manual for local authorities on the administration of housing benefit review boards. However, there seems to have been no progress on the fundamental issue of transferring the work of housing benefit review boards to social security appeals tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bodies other than the Department of Social Security have commented on such matters. In its 1994-95 annual report, the Council on Tribunals commented that it had been urging the Department of Social Security to reform the review system for housing benefit since 1987. Recently, the council's concern has increased because of changes in benefit introduced this January. The council raised the matter with the Department, the response of which was that no firm decision had been made on the future of housing benefit review boards, that any change would incur additional costs and that primary legislation would be needed for a change to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission said that the social security appeals tribunal mechanism
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not just offer safeguards for the individual claimants who bring cases. Decisions help set standards, act as a form of quality control, and help ensure consistent, equitable treatment."</p></blockquote>
In contrast, the commission considers that the internal review and the review board system is flawed and that changing to social security appeals tribunals
	<br><blockquote><p>"would provide the Government with some assurance that the system was being operated consistently and equitably."</p></blockquote>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Citizens advice bureaux give much help and advice to people who want to appeal about housing benefit. I refer to a few comments that they have heard from local councillors about the delays in setting up hearings:
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is an election in the near future… it is difficult to get the housing committee together… the clerk is on sick leave".</p></blockquote>
It has often been instructed that benefit claimants should not be encouraged to make appeals because of in-house problems. That is not a fair way in which to deal with people who often have legitimate claims and who want their housing benefit settlement reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of a housing benefit review board some years ago when I was a councillor in Southampton. We set it up within the terms set out by the Government. Having listened to other local authorities and colleagues, I know that the system is not set up fairly in many parts of the country. There are already new changes in housing benefit and there are new changes in the pipeline, which we shall be discussing later this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a terrific increase in the amount of work of housing benefit review boards which means that, in some areas, people will not receive a fair hearing because the review board hearings are not held regularly and are not set up properly. I took part in housing benefit review boards that operated fairly and had all-party commitments. As a result of that, I consider that there are some merits in housing benefit review boards, not least because they are operated by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertook research into whether the amendment would make a terrific difference to the present position. I concluded that, in most cases, people would have their reviews heard at social security appeals tribunals quicker and easier than they can now, because local authorities are not administering housing benefit review boards properly. There are no national figures for how long it takes housing benefit review boards to determine reviews and the Audit Commission feels that there is no national accountability for how the boards operate. Even if the Under-Secretary is not willing to consider the amendment, I hope that he will examine the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also worried whether there might be more delays by appeals being made to social security appeal tribunals, but the evidence showed that an appeals-based system will not necessarily mean that people will have to wait longer. Again, however, there are no national figures showing what actually goes on. Councillors and organisations, such as citizens advice bureaux and Shelter, know that real problems exist in the way in which the housing benefit review boards operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience leads me to believe that in some ways local authorities benefit from the housing benefit review board. It is a tremendous mine of information about what is happening in a council's housing benefit review department. In many authorities, however, the review boards do not meet often enough, they are not independent and people do not get a fair hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will look favourably on the amendment, which would allow an independent right of appeal to people who are not satisfied with their housing benefit. That is fundamental to proper review procedures for people who feel that their claim has not been dealt with fairly. The system is flawed and operates differently in different areas. There is a good case for change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to the hon. Lady that there is a question mark over whether a social security appeal tribunal is the appropriate body to deal with housing benefit appeals. The High Court has pointed out that, despite the similarity of wording of the relevant regulations, housing benefit has a different purpose from other income-related benefits, such as income support. If they were dealt with by the same body, that might fundamentally distort the proper administration and adjudication of housing benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The recommendation came from the Department of Social Security. Although the High Court may have expressed a view, I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would comment on the recommendation made by a Government Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady anticipates me. I shall come to that, but I thought it appropriate to explain the background. Social security appeal tribunals already have a heavy workload, and housing benefit appeals might overload the system, causing long delays with possible hardship to claimants, compared with the present system with its statutory time limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the matter of cost. At a time when we are trying to maintain tight control of the social security budget, transferring responsibility for housing benefit appeals to the social security appeal tribunal system has clear cost implications. It cannot be assumed that any additional costs could simply be recouped by an equivalent cut in the subsidy paid to local authorities. Indeed, the administrative costs to authorities might rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear that authorities would welcome such a major structural change to the housing benefit system, at a time when they are involved in major changes affecting benefits administration both directly and indirectly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that cost is more important than justice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not saying that, but the costs involved must be considered. It may not be the Liberal-Democrat approach to think about burdens on the taxpayer, but others take that responsibility on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have in the past recognised that there may be a case for adopting the social security appeal tribunals system, but we are examining the present appeals structure for all benefits to see whether efficiency can be increased. I make no apology for saying that or for wanting further savings for the taxpayer. We should keep in mind that what we save could be returned to the taxpayer or used more effectively in other directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of our various considerations, the amendment is unacceptable to the Government at present. However, I wish to give further thought to the hon. Lady's point about relevant national figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's understanding of the problem, but I am a little disappointed because there is a good case for examining the matter more urgently. We talked earlier about the problems of pensioners and housing benefit.
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
Every time that the Government make changes to housing benefit rules—it happens not infrequently—the local authorities have to gear themselves up to take account of them. The Minister will know as well as I do that there is often little time for local authorities to put in place the various technologies that are required. He will also know that, on occasion, there has been administrative chaos in many local authorities when they have tried to deal with housing benefit changes. At such times, many vulnerable people are affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember bad cases of pensioners being suddenly thrown into debt and not knowing how to deal with it. Local authorities had to get the housing benefit review boards together. There is evidence that many cases were not dealt with quickly or fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will at least study two matters: how the review boards work and what changes might be necessary, and how to feed through to the Department of Social Security the tremendous problems which occur when housing benefit changes take place. If he is serious about considering the fact that there are no national figures, I should hope that, as a result of changes that have occurred this year and any future changes, he will put in place a monitoring system to discover not only what is going on with housing benefit payments—they might not be his responsibility—but how housing benefit review boards are being affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know whether housing benefit review boards are meeting within the time that they are supposed to meet and whether local authorities are giving claimants information about their rights under review boards. It is clear that even that does not happen in some local authorities. There is plenty of evidence from around the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should study ways in which the matter can be reconsidered. It could be looked at by the DSS, but that appears not to be good enough for him. I feel strongly that people should have the right to an independent review, but the Minister did not adequately deal with the point that there is no independence. Councillors make decisions about their own authority. A person who has tried his best to deal with the system, but has fallen foul of it, can be faced with the local council, even though it might have done things wrongly, demanding money back under the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing benefit review boards have the ability to decide not to get such money back, but the decision has to be made by councillors who are concerned about their local authority budget. Later, we will discuss cash-limiting housing benefit to local authorities, which makes the matter even more urgent. How can people get a proper independent review if the decision is made by people who are looking over their shoulders at how the local authority budget will be affected? The Minister discussed other matters, not the independence of that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to push the amendment to a Division. I feel extremely strongly about independence, which should be present if people want a review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the amendment of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) has, rightly, highlighted the problems relating to the operation of review boards, I am not sure that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
particular recommendation that she has put forward is the correct way to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In local government there is, quite reasonably, a view that its powers have been increasingly circumscribed and reduced by central Government, who are increasingly using it as the agent for carrying out national policies. To take away from local authorities the ability to review the decisions taken by them on housing benefit would send the serious message that, effectively, the only role of local authorities is to act as the administrators of a scheme which is in every respect prescribed by central Government. On a subsequent group of amendments we shall consider issues concerning local authority discretion, which has been sadly circumscribed over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of justice, I accept entirely what the hon. Member for Christchurch said about the importance of getting good and impartial decisions. My experience has been that the standard of review boards has improved considerably since the early days when, in many cases, they were unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. Most local authorities try to carry out the reviews properly and impartially, although some fail to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it is necessarily the right way forward to take the power from local authorities and give it to a central Government agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I remind him that there is still the local authority internal review, which is the first appeal when somebody is not satisfied. I, too, am concerned about powers being taken from local authorities, but we are talking about individuals getting independent reviews when it comes to justice. There is a difference, and I think that the hon. Gentleman is confusing the two issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am far from confusing them. People concerned about a whole series of issues affecting their entitlement to various rights that should be delivered by local authorities to go to a local authority review. If people are unhappy about the handling of their applications for housing or other services delivered by the authority, the proper review procedure is within the authority, with the subsequent possibility of seeking judicial review of the authority's decision. Exactly the same applies in the case of housing benefit review boards: if the claimant is dissatisfied with the decision of the board, there is the option of seeking judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded of the case for the amendment. It would unduly circumscribe local government's ability to operate the scheme and it would send the wrong message, because it would imply a lack of confidence in the ability of local authorities to improve and to ensure that they deliver a high standard of service and listen to the views of people in their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I recommend that the hon. Gentleman talks to some of his local council colleagues? One of the people with whom I served on Southampton city council is now a Labour housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
spokesman on the Association of District Councils and strongly agrees that the process should not be in the hands of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak to many councillors from all parts of the country. I have no doubt that some of them believe that it is right and proper for the matter to be handled in a social security framework, but there are many others who would strongly resent the removal of the power from the local authority and do not want the local authority to be subject to a separate appeal procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further issue on which the hon. Member for Christchurch should reflect. Given that local authority budgets are extremely tightly constrained in many ways, the operation of an independent review could result in an authority being required to make payments that breached its budget limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The many difficult and serious issues all suggest that the amendment would not at this time be a sensible or good way forward. Local government should be entitled to review the procedures that it operates. The hon. Member for Christchurch referred to the initial review by officers, but she should remember that there is a two-stage review procedure. It is right and proper that councillors should review the officers' decision. The two-stage review is widely understood. It enables councillors to consider whether a mistake has been made in procedures and ultimately to decide on the merit of the appeal brought by the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want there to be justice and we all want the best possible operation of housing benefit reviews. I counsel the hon. Lady against pressing for the complete removal of local authority discretion and making local authorities subject to an entirely separate review body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 126, line 22, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) For subsection (8) substitute—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(8) An authority shall disregard, in determining a person's income (whether he is the occupier of a dwelling or any other person whose income falls to be aggregated with that of the occupier of a dwelling), the whole of any war disablement pension or war widows pension payable to that person.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>(8A) An authority may modify the housing benefit scheme administered by the authority to such an extent as may be prescribed and any such modification may be adopted by resolution of the authority?".".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would include in the mandatory national scheme for housing benefits a complete disregard for war disablement pensions and pensions for war widows. There is currently a mixed situation; many councils completely disregard those pensions under the discretionary power, some councils partially disregard them and others disregard them to the value of the £10 under the mandatory national scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting issue is that that disregard is the only discretionary element specifically mentioned under the national scheme. There is provision for local authorities to make amendments within prescribed limits to the scheme, but they can make a complete disregard for the full amount of those payments if they so choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities decide how to use the discretionary power according to their circumstances—the financial position, competition from other important expenditure and other matters on which local authorities may choose to use discretionary disregards. In mining areas, for example, local authorities feel that they are in a difficult position, because they receive competing claims from people who were disabled in mining accidents. They may find that their budgets do not stretch to offering disregards both for people disabled in war and for those disabled in mining accidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three main arguments why the Government should accept the amendment. The first two arguments were clearly outlined by the current Secretary of State for Transport, the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), during a debate on the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. He moved an amendment dealing with the disregard and raised two important matters, the first of which was mobility. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will agree with the first; part of their housing policy is to promote mobility and to avoid decisions about where to live being distorted by local authority decisions… The present system for war widows inhibits mobility … It is not right that, because of the grounds on which the Government have chosen to debate housing policy—the level playing field—war widows who may wish to move nearer to their relatives, or for other reasons, should be penalised due to the odd ways in which different local authorities interpret their discretion.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The second reason is that war widows simply do not understand why those in one part of the country receive more benefit than others in another part, although their circumstances … may be identical".—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 18 April 1989; c. 948.]</p></blockquote>
Those were two compelling arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third argument I would use is equally compelling. It supports the campaign mounted continuously in recent years by the Royal British Legion. The argument is simple: that those pensions have been earned in the service of the nation. Those are national pensions and should be part of a national mandatory scheme of disregard, and paid for out of national taxation. It is somewhat anomalous that something so national, which has the same impact on people irrespective of where they live, should be treated differently for housing benefit, each local authority using a different scheme. Given the extent of
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
Government regulation on that matter and that they insist on a national scheme for housing benefit, it is anomalous that the disregard should be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a matter of policy difference between the parties. The matter has in the past received all-party support from my hon. Friends, from Liberal Democrats and other minor parties and from Conservative Members. Indeed, the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Banks), who is not in his seat at present, signed an early-day motion last November urging that change to the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the matter was last debated, in 1989, the Government objected to the amendment moved by the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, who is now Secretary of State for Transport, but was then a Back Bencher, because it would not do what he wanted. The right hon. Gentleman wanted the disregard to be part of a national scheme. He could not do it then, but, in his amendment, he gave local authorities the discretion to include the costs of disregard in a local scheme within the housing revenue account and, if they could, to claim extra subsidy. The amendment was opposed by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), then the Minister for Local Government, but now the present Secretary of State for the Environment, but other Conservative Members voted with the Opposition to change the Bill. In fact, the Secretary of State for the Environment was right to point out that the amendment would not achieve what the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton wanted. However, he recognised the constraints. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whatever happens, I shall ensure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security clearly understands my hon. Friend's considerable strength of argument and strength of mind about the issue. No doubt those who vote for the amendment will do so irrespective of the fact that, in many respects, it will have the opposite effect from the one intended. But those who do not vote for it and who feel strongly about war widows have the absolute assurance that I will not allow the fact that a vote is taken—taken because of the nature of the amendment—to make it appear that there is not strong pressure for a change in the rules for war widows. I shall make that clear to my right hon. Friend.".—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 18 April 1989; c. 953–4.]</p></blockquote>
There were discussions between the Departments of the Environment and Social Security about where responsibility lay for that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that the Secretary of State for the Environment has not spoken to his right hon. Friend very often in the past seven years, because the legislation is still unchanged. That amendment did not do fully the job that the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton knew needed to be done. The amendment was agreed to, but it did not give the disregard on a mandatory basis in all local authority areas. It is still given at local authorities' discretion. War pensioners and war widows are still treated differently in different parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time to put that matter right. It is anomalous to treat people who receive that pension so differently. If someone's disability is acknowledged to be more serious than was initially believed, and the percentage of their disability—and, therefore, their pension—rises, they could lose 72p in the pound for any extra disability pension because of reduced housing and council tax benefit. That cannot be right. It is impossible to explain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
to people who were disabled in the service of their country why they are penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be asked why people in those circumstances should be treated differently from others. The answer is so obvious that it hardly needs stating. The Government acknowledge that war widows are different. In 1989, they introduced special payments for those who were widowed before 1973. The Government recognised the special case of war widows and disregarded the payment for national tax and housing and council tax benefit purposes. They set a precedent with the 1989 changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept that the argument has been won—not in the debate today, but in recent months, in the campaign that has been run throughout the country and which was supported by hon. Members of all parties. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, I cannot provide many quotes from "Henry IV", "Henry V" or "Henry VI", but the little word "agreed" must appear in one of those plays. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will find a suitable quotation that contains the word "agreed", and respond positively to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member for Attercliffe and the Committee that the Government are conscious of the great debt that the country owes to its war disabled and bereaved. We acknowledge that they constitute a very special case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All war pensions—and the wide range of associated allowances that are paid as part of a war pension—are now completely tax free and continue to be paid at preferential rates when compared with their social security counterparts. They are fully uprated in line with prices as measured by the retail prices index.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the basic weekly amounts of war disablement pension range from £20 to £100, dependent on the degree of disability, the most severely disabled war pensioner could receive up to £364 per week tax free. War widows receive, on average, £143 a week tax free. That includes widows who receive the special pre-1973 supplementary pension—currently £49.77 a week—which was introduced in 1990 for those widows whose husbands' service in the forces ended before 31 March 1973. That is paid in addition to the standard widow's pension of £76.35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as being tax free, the first £10 of any war disablement or war widow's pension is disregarded across the income-related benefits, including housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the whole of any war widow's pre-1973 supplementary pension is totally disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the amendment, it should be borne in mind that when assessing entitlement to income-related benefits, such as housing benefit or council tax benefit, taking income into account is the norm and disregards are the exception. That is the nature of such benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Attercliffe said, local authorities have the power to enhance the mandatory disregard of £10 or even allow for a total disregard of a war pension. But each local authority must decide how much its electorate wishes to spend in that way, having
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
regard to its other priorities, and the consequences for the local council tax payer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We estimate that the cost of introducing a mandatory total disregard of war disablement and war widows' pensions across all the income-related benefits would be around £75 million—£40 million in housing benefit and council tax benefit alone. That would be in addition to the £25 million cost of the present disregards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Successive Governments—not just this one—have preferred to concentrate available resources on maintaining benefit levels, rather than increasing the amount of income which may be disregarded in any particular case. The Government have an excellent record in dealing with these very special cases, but I do not believe that they should go further in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Attercliffe. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occasionally, the Government are keen to give local authorities rights regarding local decisions. In general, I am in favour of that, but on some issues that cross party lines, such as this one, that approach is unfair. Concessionary fares is another issue that affects pensioners in particular. I am really disappointed in the Government. By golly, they could do with some friends outside. Have their PR people failed to tell them of the brownie points that could be gained by accepting this proposal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has told us how much money such a measure would cost, but considering the type of people about whom we are talking and the global sums spent by the Government, his response is mean-spirited, and will be seen as such by members of all political parties in the House as well as those outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that the Under-Secretary was genuine when he talked about supporting war veterans and the tremendous sacrifices that they have made for their country.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not really believe that the Under-Secretary has the support of the House on this issue. His hon. Friends may choose not to oppose what he has said, but I believe that there is strong cross-party agreement that the present position is unsatisfactory. Local authorities are often put in an invidious position when the discretion that the Government theoretically give them cannot be exercised without making war widows and war disablement pensioners feel an immense grievance and sense of injustice. The only sensible and logical way forward is to recognise that this is an injustice and that there needs to be a standard procedure across the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When they changed the housing benefit regulations in the late 1980s, the Government removed much of the discretion that local authorities had, and limited their discretion to one or two closely defined areas, including this one. It would have been more honest, appropriate and responsible to incorporate a total disregard of war pensions and war widows' pensions in the regulations applying in all areas, rather than maintain a position which leads to a real sense of justified grievance and unhappiness. I am sorry that the Minister has not felt able to move more positively towards the amendment which has support across a broad political spectrum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most disappointed by the Minister's response. It seemed to recognise many of the arguments that have been advanced not just in Committee but by the Royal British Legion and others who have been campaigning on this issue. But to tell us that £75 million, out of a Government budget of billions of pounds a year, cannot be found is so mean spirited that it is hardly merits a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is mean spirited because we have a national scheme here for housing benefit. It runs into pages and pages of regulations which local authorities must follow and which detail in precise terms what should and should not be taken into account. The national housing benefit scheme is intended to achieve consistency across the country. The only issue in the legislation that is specifically mentioned and then left at the local authority's discretion is the treatment of war disablement and war widows' pensions. That is the only issue, but it is also the only issue which should be seen in national terms.

The people who went to fight did not fight for Sheffield or for Bradford, Greenwich or Skipton. They fought for the United Kingdom as a whole. The pension was given for service for their country. As national legislators, we have a responsibility to ensure that this is dealt with out of national taxation, not out of local authority payments and at local authority discretion. It should be done on a mandatory basis so that all these people are treated equally, wherever they live in the country.

I shall be asking leave to withdraw the amendment for the simple reason that I do not believe that Conservative Members will support it and so it will be defeated. I want to bring it back on Report. There are some Tory Members who will support it when we have another chance to discuss it. They have signed early-day motions, and the mood in the country when we get the campaign running up to Report will, I hope, persuade
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
the Government to change their mind. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are essentially technical amendments. Amendment No. 321 removes a reference in paragraph 1(5) to subsection (11) of section 134 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. A separate amendment to that subsection is made in paragraph 1(6). Amendment No. 322 removes from paragraph (4) a meaningless reference to an Act which is not mentioned elsewhere. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 363, in page 126, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(12A) If the housing benefit scheme includes power for an authority to exercise a discretion in awarding housing benefit to a person who would suffer exceptional hardship if that discretion were not exercised, the Secretary of State shall not in any year specify a permitted total for that authority in relation to that discretion which is less than such amount as is necessary, in the view of the authority, for the purpose of exercising that discretion in that year".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is also concerned with local authority discretion. The regulations for housing benefit were altered at the beginning of this year in a way which restricted local authorities' discretion to continue to make payments to people occupying accommodation that might have been regarded as unreasonably expensive or too large for their needs but who would in the past have been protected if they had fallen into certain categories of need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new regulations simply allow a limited discretion to make additional payments where the authority believes there will be exceptional hardship in such cases. The problem is that the Government have left little money to assist local authorities, which will not be able to exercise their discretion properly without it resulting in unfair discrimination. The figures suggest that they will only be able to help between 10 and 30 per cent, of those applicants who might formerly have expected to have received assistance in similar circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, local authorities believe that elderly tenants and families with dependent children will be subject to housing benefit restrictions that will cause them hardship and possibly lead to them losing their homes. Local authorities are rightly concerned about the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require the Secretary of State to specify a permitted total. It would require it to be adequate to meet the authorities' needs to make discretionary payments, which is a simple principle. If the discretion is to be in place, there should be a limit that is adequate to enable local authorities to discharge it properly. I hope that the Under-Secretary has no difficulty in accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would enable each local authority to determine for itself the level of discretionary spending in any given year. That would render the permitted total meaningless because it would merely reflect the wishes of individual local authorities. The permitted total exists for a good reason. It provides authorities with a powerful incentive to exercise their discretion carefully and, therefore, safeguard the taxpayers' funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without a permitted total determined by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, it would be a simple matter for any given local authority to subvert the policy intention that housing benefit should, in the main, be limited to the generality of local rent levels and that higher amounts should go only to those claimants who genuinely need them. A permitted totals order for 1996-97 has yet to be made, but the amount will be designed to ensure adequate provision for those who need it most. Accordingly, I resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary's remarks about the permitted totals having yet to be decided reveal the nonsense of the position. Here we are, less than a month before the start of the next financial year and local authorities will not know within what limits they will have to operate. The framework is most unsatisfactory. Figures show that authorities will have the greatest difficulty in meeting their obligations to people who will genuinely incur hardship because the Government have progressively screwed down the amount of discretion available and the maximum permitted total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the original rent rebate and rent allowance scheme was introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, it was 10 per cent, of total expenditure. It has been progressively whittled away. It is clear from the figures that only some 10 to 30 per cent, of people who have been helped in the past in such circumstances are likely to qualify under the much more restrictive figures that are being imposed by the Government. There will be genuine cases of hardship. People will suffer as a result of the provisions and some could even lose their homes. If they become homeless and have to be accommodated by the local authority, the long-term cost will probably be much greater than the small amount of additional money involved in giving help to people in such circumstances. The Under-Secretary's response is unsatisfactory and I regret that he is unwilling to accept the amendment. However, to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disappointed with the hon. Member for Greenwich for withdrawing the amendment. Councillors are very upset about the matter. I referred earlier to the independence of housing benefit review boards and the provision will make it difficult for them to be independent. If they are to be fair throughout the year and give the money to the people who need it most, according to the cash limit, they will need to consider what they will be doing throughout the year to be absolutely fair. That will be impossible for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received representations from members of my local authority and I know that councillors throughout the country feel extremely strongly about the measure.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with this amendment with military precision and speed. Amendments Nos. 364 and 365 are to do with the payment of subsidy to local authorities for administering housing benefit. Amendment No. 364 is one of those familiar amendments which would substitute the word "may" with the word "shall". Under the present arrangements, the Secretary of State simply has discretion to pay subsidy to local authorities. That should be mandatory
Amendment No. 365 is to do with the form of payment. We believe that the payment should be a specific grant paid directly to authorities. Under present arrangements, only 50 per cent, of the money is paid directly; the rest is fed into the revenue support grant framework. That is a confusing and messy arrangement, and there is much to be said for making it simple and clear. As local authorities perform the specific responsibility of administering housing benefit, they should receive a specific grant for doing so. I hope that the Ministers respond with similar military precision and give their assent to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to respond in exactly the way that the hon. Gentleman wants, but to the opposite effect. Amendments Nos. 364 and 365 would restrict the flexibility inherent in the proposed arrangements and, indeed, those that exist now. The existing arrangements have operated effectively for several years against a background in which many authorities have made real progress towards improving their standards of administration of both housing and council tax benefits. We should continue that process, not put it into reverse, which is what the amendments would do. The amendments are unnecessary and unnecessarily restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I wonder whether I can deal with this in two minutes. Let me see how quick I can be; I have long notes and short notes. I shall use the short ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 347 relates to a question on which we touched earlier about when it is reasonably practicable for local authorities to make a decision. They must now make a decision within 14 days, or when reasonably practicable after that. They can give interim payments if a decision is not possible. The amendment would lay down that it is reasonably practicable for an authority to make a decision by the time a rent officer has done so. It would limit the time in which the local authority could claim that it had not come to a decision. It would define the matter more concretely and place limits on what local authorities do, and might prevent them dragging their heels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady kindly suggested, we have explored this matter already today. I am still of the same mind on the subject—for the reasons that I hope I gave earlier. The amendment is not in the best interests of claimants or taxpayers, as it would compel payment of benefit in cases where genuine doubts had arisen as to the propriety or accuracy of payment. Measures have already been established to help to speed up the claims process, as we all want. I therefore ask the hon. Lady not to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
