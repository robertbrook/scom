	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.—[
	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I wish to draw your attention to today's Order Paper. We are considering a sittings motion to meet this afternoon at 4 pm, but if we meet at that time, the House will be considering the business that is set out on page 1604 of the Order Paper. A number of items—from 1 to 13—would directly interest hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies, including yourself, Mr. Hughes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second item in the Order Paper is consideration of Lords amendments to the Severn Bridges Bill. You have done a great deal of work for the Severn bridges over many years. Mr. Hughes, on behalf of the House of Commons and of Wales. We seek your advice on whether the afternoon sitting could be postponed, delayed or adjourned, bearing in mind the fact that item 11 is Local Government Finance (Wales). I ask the question in the interest of all hon. Members—as much for the Government as for the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that the Government want to push through as much legislation as possible in their last days in office. We realise also that they will offer goodies as bribes to the electorate before they go out of office. However, what will happen if the House reaches the subject of local government finance in Wales before 6 o'clock? What will be the position of members of the Committee? Will the Secretary of State stay to the end of the afternoon sitting? Who will deal with Welsh business on the Floor of the House? All those questions need to be answered before we can agree to the sittings motion proposed by the Secretary of State. I blame the Government for trying to cram into one sitting all the serious business that will affect Wales greatly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but it is not a matter for me. My commission from Mr. Speaker is to take the Chair of the Welsh Grand Committee. Nevertheless, I am sure that the remarks the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell) will be taken into consideration by those concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I am sure that you are aware that the Labour and Conservative parties normally select the subject that the Committee will debate. However, I wish to ask you whether you have received a request,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
through the usual channels, to change the subject for debate today? The issue of constitutional reform is now very high on the agenda. Moreover, the Scottish Grand Committee is considering that matter in respect of Scotland and there has been a special televised debate there. Yet such a debate has been denied to the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be the final sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee before the general election. I want to ask, therefore, whether all parties could agree to change the subject today, or agree to another sitting before the election so that the people of Wales can have the opportunity to listen to all points of view on this important subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Member, but the matter that he raised is not one for me. The issue of what we are to debate today was placed on the Order Paper and presumably was decided by the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to the sittings motion which was moved by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. First, perhaps I may respond to the point—which you ruled was not a point of order, Mr. Hughes—raised by the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones)—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The time may have come when the Welsh Grand Committee should debate devolution or home rule for Wales. I suggest that my right hon. Friend considers having such a debate. It might be in the best interests of the people of Wales and members of this Committee if a meeting of the Committee were convened in Cardiff—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"]—to discuss the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not speak at length because that might spoil the rest of our day's debate. Before I conclude, however, I give support to what the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell) said about this afternoon's sitting of the Committee. When the Question is put on the sittings motion, members of the Committee should bear in mind the hon. Gentleman's point: the matter of the Welsh rate support grant might be raised on the Floor of the House before we conclude our afternoon sitting. That subject is most important to all Members of Parliament representing Welsh constituencies. Therefore, I suggest that we do not sit this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member's remarks will be taken into consideration by those concerned. I suggest that we now proceed with the debate, remembering that our time is limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much want to respond to what has been said about the subject of today's debate. However, as you rightly pointed out, Mr. Hughes, we are very much in the hand of the House, which has already determined that we should debate education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respond to the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) and to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) by telling the Committee that I shall seek a debate on the structure of government in Wales at the next meeting of the Grand Committee. My hon. Friend's suggestion was interesting. I should like to respond positively; perhaps discussions could take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
place, through the usual channels, with a view to holding the next meeting of the Committee in Cardiff, or elsewhere in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, that would require an amendment to Standing Order No. 98, which governs the Welsh Grand Committee. I am willing to discuss, through the usual channels, amending that Standing Order so that the next meeting of this great Committee could take place in Wales on the issue of the structure—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I must tell the hon. Member for Ogmore that since I became Secretary of State I have not missed one minute of the discussions of the Welsh Grand Committee; I have never left the Room during our discussions because our debates are extremely interesting and helpful. However, given the views expressed against our sitting this afternoon, I am willing to withdraw the motion if that meeting with the Committee's approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. Surely the Secretary of State's words, however welcome, will be empty unless we are assured that he will use his best endeavours to ensure that if there is a meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee to discuss constitutional matters and if it is held at Cardiff, it will be held at a time when the Secretary of State has some power over it. He will have power only until an election is held. I wonder whether his was dying swan speech—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Can we have a clearer assurance from him that there will be a meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee in Cardiff to discuss constitutional matters before 10 March?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman—it is the first time that I have been called a swan. I believe that the description attracted some criticism from his colleagues for being too complimentary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I wanted to respond positively and quickly to the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North. However, as you rightly point out, Mr. Hughes, the House should determine that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Raffan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for making that point. It would be useful, however, if he would respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) by giving an assurance that he will use his best endeavours to ensure that the Committee sits again before 10 March. I should prefer the meeting to be in the Coal Exchange building in Cardiff—after all, at least one of the Scottish Grand Committee's sittings was held in the Royal High School building. It is important to debate the matter before the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his assurance that there will be an early debate in Wales on constitutional matters. The usual channels should talk to all political parties in, which are represented in Committee so that we can agree on a date that is suitable to us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. You are more tolerant than most other Chairmen, and you have been tolerant today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I have been accused by an hon. Member from north Wales—who I shall not name—of always raising bogus points of order. My point of order related to the sittings motion—namely, whether we should sit at 4 o'clock—which I did not want to debate. Other points of order have ranged widely—whether the Committee should have further sittings and where they should be held. I did not suggest that we should not sit this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was seeking a ruling about whether the Committee should adjourn—at 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock or just before 6 o'clock—when the House debates item No. 11 on the Order Paper, which is Local Government Finance (Wales). We could debate that matter in the House and return to Committee to conclude our debate on education. I did not say that we should not sit this afternoon, as the Minister suggested that I had done. I was seeking advice from the Clerks about whether it would be possible for us to adjourn when the House debates local government finance in Wales, and to return to our debate for one or two hours, or whatever time remains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State want to withdraw the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in the hands of the Committee; it must determine the hours that it wishes to sit. I moved the motion, but I am happy to withdraw it if the Committee so desires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of education in Wales.</p></blockquote>
I am pleased that we are debating this topic. The timing of the debate is opportune because the chief inspector of Her Majesty's inspectorate in Wales is today publishing his annual "Review of Educational Provision in Wales" for 1991–92. Copies of it are available to members of the Committee and it is in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Library. While there are aspects which continue to give cause for concern, on the whole the report is encouraging and highlights—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I went to the Library this morning to obtain the report, but it was not available to hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just said that I checked with the Library that the report was available. Copies of the report were also available in the Committee Room from the moment that hon. Members arrived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hughes. That is a most outrageous way to treat members of the Committee. It is no good making the report available in the Library when so many members of the Committee want to read it. To make it available once the Committee's sitting has begun is useless, because we are supposed to be debating it sensibly and realistically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a point of order, but I have no doubt that the right hon. Member's remarks will be taken into consideration by those concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report is being published today. I have made copies available from the moment that the hon. Members arrived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that the report of Her Majesty's inspectorate is an important document. However, it is not good enough for the Secretary of State to say, at the start of our debate, that this lengthy and vital document was made available to us this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Secretary of State that his counterpart at the Department of Education and Science saw fit to present a similar document weeks ago so that hon. Members could consult it before the debate. As I said, it is just not good enough for the Secretary of State to come into the Welsh Grand Committee to debate education in Wales—notice of which he has had for weeks—and present a document to members of the Committee at the very last moment. We must conclude that it was his intention to avoid close scrutiny of the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not have the report weeks ago. I have arranged for it to be available today—the day on which it is published. I hope that hon. Members will recognise that it was available from the start of today's proceedings—as soon as the doors were open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer hon. Members to various areas in which considerable progress has been made over the past year. First, about four fifths of the work inspected in schools and in further, higher and community education in 1990–91 was satisfactory or better. That is that first main finding of the report. Secondly, local education authorities are setting high standards in accommodation in new and recently refurbished school premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, teacher supply has been generally satisfactory. Fourthly, the year has seen increases in enrol-
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
ments to full and part-time courses in further, higher and community education, and greater strengthening of links with industry. There is much cause for satisfaction in those developments. The governing bodies of colleges, like those of schools, have become increasingly influential, and college management systems have become sharper as they take responsibility for their budgets and delegated funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned buildings. Is he aware that the condition of buildings in many of Wales' schools and colleges is wholly inadequate? The standard of the buildings has deteriorated substantially over recent years. Much more money needs to be spent on maintenance and on cleaning—of windows, for example, through which people cannot see. Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that more money will be available in future to meet that important need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am keen immediately to respond positively to the hon. Gentleman. I announced a 24 per cent increase in capital funding this year and I am worried to hear from local education authorities that it is likely that there will be a 15 per cent underspend on that funding. I should like to refer again to that matter later in my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my right hon. Friend, but I should like to follow on from the important point made by the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley). Under local management of schools, there is a division of responsibility for school building maintenance between LEAs and schools. In Clywd, for example, the LEA is responsible for structural repairs while the school is responsible for day-to-day maintenance. Along with many others, I am worried about the definition of school building maintenance: some aspects might fall between the LEA and the schools, leading to controversy and debate as to which is the responsible authority. If the position is not clearly defined, we shall witness a further deterioration of school building stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised that, as parents, teachers and children are entitled to expect that school buildings will be maintained in good condition. There are many new and remodelled school buildings in the Principality where that is so; but there are problems, as the chief inspector notes in his report.

Some of the problems arise from the design of buildings erected in the 1960s and 1970s. But most of the problems now being experienced arise from the "legacy of neglect"—to quote from the HMI report—of the building stock by those responsible for it, the local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Current expenditure on education has increased in real terms from £847 million in 1979–80 to a budget of £1,132 million in 1991–92, at a time when pupil numbers have declined from 530,000 in 1979 to 449,000 in 1991. Within the resources made available, there has been sufficient money to enable LEAs properly to maintain their school buildings. Figures for capital provision tell a similar story, rising from £45.8 million six years ago to £66.6 million in 1991–92. again in real

terms. Both I and my predecessors have specifically indicated that the increased resources provided have been to enable LEAs to reduce the problem of surplus places and to improve the school stock. LEAs have thus had the opportunity to devote additional resources to capital maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me tell the Committee what has happened. In 1989–90, LEAs on their capital budget, spent 4.6 per cent less than we provided; in 1990–91, it was 3.1 per cent less; and in 1991–92 the underspend is forecast to be in the region of 15 per cent. It is evident that while I can provide LEAs with resources for school buildings, I cannot make them spend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a technical point but an important one to ensure that the Secretary of State does not mislead the people of Wales. When he uses the words "in real terms", I assume that he does not mean "in real terms" as normally understood. Rather, he means retail prices index inflation, which is entirely meaningless when applied to the education service. A far more accurate guide to establishing whether enough money is being provided to maintain the same level of service this year as in the previous year is the rise in cost of the education service. We are not dealing with buying butter, groceries or fuel for the home. The Secretary of State should define "real terms" in relation to the specific index of rising prices in education—a labour-intensive service. He should not speak of "real terms" if he means to refer to the RPI, which is quite different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. If the hon. Gentleman were to study these matters properly, he would find that successive Governments—including the previous Labour Government—always talk in real terms about not the RPI but the gross domestic product deflator, which takes all aspects into account. When I used the phrase "in real terms", I was following the traditional approach that has been adopted by successive Governments. I reiterate the point that, using that approach, the increase has been substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Public Accounts Committee meeting this Monday, we debated the funding of further education colleges. On the basis of the GDP deflator figure provided by the Treasury, it was argued that 5 per cent was the extra funding necessary to keep real-terms spending level. However, the Treasury figure was wrong. Rather than 5 per cent, 8.5 per cent was the required level of increase in funding. So which figure is the Secretary of State using? I am talking about the previous year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
on the principle that, just as consumers have a basic entitlement to quality whatever they buy, parents of school children should have a similar right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This policy has inspired a number of developments over the past year, including the parents charter and the Education (Schools) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents charter provides parents with a readable, factual summary of their rights and responsibilities in connection with state schools, of the choices that they can exercise, and of the information that they can obtain about their schools' performance and that of other schools in their area. It is an invaluable reference document to which all parents should have ready access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main successes of the Education Reform Act 1988 was the introduction of local management of schools. LMS places power with those best placed to make decisions about priorities in schools and about the needs of individual children, the heads and the governors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the so-called success of LMS, which the Secretary of State described, account for the fact that 25 per cent of school leavers in Mid Glamorgan leave without a graded qualification, compared with 11 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the long-standing question of the difficulty of ensuring that young people stay at school; this is not a new problem in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the introduction of LMS, which has generally met with approval throughout Wales. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) will recall taking me round one of his local schools. Her Majesty's inspectorates' report states that the progressive implementation of LMS has, on the whole, proceeded satisfactorily and has, in most cases, been accompanied by a perceptible sharpening of managerial skills. This can only he good news for a more efficient and effective use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like all schools in Wales to have complete control over their budget as soon as possible. There are about 450 schools in Wales with delegated responsibility; this figures is set to increase to 714 in April. By April 1995, all schools will have control over their budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State spoke of giving all schools control over their own budgets. Will he consider giving village primary schools control over their transport budgets. Many people in the villages think that they can provide school transport much less expensively than the local authority, thereby ensuring that they have extra money for the classroom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reflect on that, although I understand that local education authorities have said that such a system would be impossible to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LMS will be seen to reap benefits in all schools, even small rural schools, as clearly it goes hand in hand with curriculum reform. Delegation of effective responsibility for day-to-day management to those who deliver
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
the service is the best way to run any large body. Proper delegation improves performance, morale and responsiveness to customers and cuts out unnecessary beureaucracy. We aim to give all schools in Wales the autonomy to do what they do best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hand in hand with LMS goes strong school government. I pay tribute to the excellent work that school governors do. The HMI report concludes that the steadily increasing influence of governing bodies on the running of schools is largely for the good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being a school governor in the 1990s is a satisfying job. As part of their wide range of responsibilities, school governors need to set the school's aims and agree its policies; decide how the school's budget is to be spent; appoint staff; look after school buildings and support school activities. Being a school governor may be a voluntary activity, but it is an important one. The work is varied, challenging and rewarding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ultimate in LMS and school government at local level is grant-maintained status. I believe that grant-maintained schools will prove to be a stimulus for higher standards; they will increase the choice available to parents; and, in time, will be an invaluable and necessary part of our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite considerable opposition from LEAs in Wales, governors at eight grant-maintained schools have balloted on whether to apply for grant-maintained status. In five the vote was in favour, and proposals were submitted to me for consideration. I am pleased to say that, so far, I have been able to approve three, two of which—Cwmcarn grant-maintained school in Gwent and Bishop Vaughan Catholic comprehensive in West Glamorgan—are already operating as grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am determined tht pupils in Welsh schools will get the quality education that they need and deserve, to equip tham with the necessary knowledge and skills required by employers now and in future, and will be able to further their opportunities to continue education at school and university. I know that I have the support of teachers, parents and employers. The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) wishes us to move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Improvement of standards is at the heart of everything. The introduction of the national curriculum, which is helping us achieve that aim, is the single most sweeping reform in education since the Education Act 1944. The curriculum for eight of the 11 national curriculum subjects in Wales has now been completed and their phased introduction is under way in primary and secondary schools. We are consulting on the final stages for the remaining three subjects—art, music and physical education. These should be introduced in the autumn. The introduction of virtually the whole curriculum in the three and a half years since the introduction of the Education Reform Act signifies remarkable progress. I am conscious of the demands that that has placed on staff, teachers and LEAs. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have seen at first hand how schools throughout Wales have taken up the challenge. Teachers deserve enormous praise for their dedication and efforts in getting this major educational

	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I disturb the Secretary of State's fantasy account of what happened to schools that opted out? They opted out not through choice or because they wanted pupils to travel further to school, or out of a search for excellence, but because they were threatened with closure. They were threatened with closure because, in the cases of Brynmawr and Cwmcarn, Gwent county council was following precisely the guidelines laid by the Secretary of State and responding to his pressure on it to save money on the numbers of pupils in schools and clear up what he described as surplus places. It is sheer hypocrisy to suggest that the choice was made by parents. The decision to allow the schools to opt out, in defiance of the Secretary of State's own guidelines, was an act of political malice, spite and ideology. The right hon.

When the Secretary of State is required to decide about any proposal to close a school, he must consider fully all the information that is available to him and judge each case on its merits. Due account is taken of economic considerations and the extent of public support or opposition.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
On the subject of quality, I stress my praise for my right hon. Friend the Minister of State in ensuring that the needs of Welsh schools have been fully taken into account. The cwricwlwm cymreig, with a distinctive Welsh dimension, includes separate subject orders for art and music, geography, history, Welsh and Welsh as a second language. The six subjects will ensure that the distinctive traditions, culture and language of Wales are fully reflected in our curriculum. In achieving that, I have appreciated the advice that I have received from the Curriculum Council for Wales, which is the equivalent body with the same statutory powers to the National Curriculum Council in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national curriculum does not just set out what should be taught. Of equal importance are the arrangements for assessing the knowledge and skills that pupils have attained against common benchmarks. For the first time, parents will be told, throughout their child's compulsory school life, how he or she is doing compared with what is expected of children in that age group—not just compared with other children in the class. They will also be able to see how the results of the school compare with these for schools in their local education authority and Wales as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first tests of seven-year-old pupils were carried out last year. The results of those tests show that seven-year-old pupils' performance in Welsh schools compares favourably with that in England. They show that 80 per cent of pupils in Wales are at or above the level expected for that age group. That does not mean that we should be complacent. The results show that there is scope, in particular, for improving the basic arithmetical and reading skills of our seven-year-olds. We also need to be sure that our children are given the opportunities to develop their abilities to the maximum. That is primarily the job of teachers. However, local education authorities and schools need to ensure that teachers are given the necessary training and support to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To implement the national curriculum and associated assessment arrangements, this year I am increasing grant-in-aid to the Curriculum Council for Wales by 10 per cent to over £1.5 million, most of which will he spent on guidance material and its teacher support programmes. We have also notified local education authorities of a £16.5 million expenditure programme of training and support for introducing the national curriculum in Wales as part of the record level of £28.4 million specific grant programme for 1992–93. Apart from being at a record level, the programme contains two new initiatives aimed directly at standards. One is to encourage innovative ideas for improving reading standards in Welsh and English in young children: the other is to improve the linguistic skills of modern foreign language teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. He has gone well on into his speech, but I wish to respond to his point about my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. My right hon. Friend and I both wrote to the Secretary of State—about Cwmcarn school and about St. Albans Roman Catholic comprehensive school in my constituency. Neither my right hon. Friend nor I said at any
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
time that we agreed with those schools opting out of the system. That is very different from what the Secretary of State implied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make it absolutely clear that I chose my words carefully. The case that was put to me was for keeping the school open. I am sure that neither the hon. Gentleman nor the Leader of the Opposition would have supported the notion of the school becoming grant maintained. I was guided by important considerations about the quality of education at the school. I wanted to put that on record because the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) seemed to suggest that I had reached the decision for perverse political aims. Nothing could be further from the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One school was closed in Gwent, and it was in my constituency. Gwent education authority followed the Secretary of State's guidelines and his pressure. The point is that, after the opt-out was allowed, the entire process—it might have had benefits—has come to a halt. That has repercussions for each pupil in Gwent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition's overall theme is the need for additional resources. I do not believe that additional resources are always necessary or the best solution. Indeed, Her Majesty's inspectorate made that point in its report, which was published today. Sometimes all that is required is to make more effective use of existing resources or to consolidate on the reforms being introduced. To quote from the report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A substantial proportion of satisfactory classroom activity, with better planning and direction, more efficient use of resources and, often, more pace and rigour, could have produced higher standards of achievement."</p></blockquote>
The variations in performance revealed by the results of the first tests of seven-year-olds also raise questions which need to be answered. Therefore, it is only right that we should encourage debate among teachers and other education professionals on the appropriateness of current practices for delivering the national curriculum. That is one reason why my right hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have launched the debate in Wales on teaching methods in primary schools in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to ensure that all primary teachers and headteachers in Wales see themselves as involved in the debate and that it acts as a catalyst for reviewing curent practices. I have also asked the chairman of the Curriculum Council for Wales to draw on the HMI consultation paper in Wales, the discussions taking place in England and the debate in Wales, and to provide me with advice in the form of practical guidance which can then he issued to all primary schools in Wales at the beginning of the next school year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me dwell on one key aspect. The Government are firmly committed to the provision of Welsh language education and Welsh language materials in the national curriculum. As part of that commitment, I am pleased to announce today the allocation of £1.9 million worth of Welsh language specific grant for projects within each of the local education authorities in 1992–93. That represents an increase of just under 11 per cent. on last year's figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The grants are intended to complement LEA's own expenditure in this sphere and the largest allocations will fund the teams of athrawon bro, or area teachers, located in each authority. Those teams of experienced teachers play an essential role in assisting schools and teachers with the introduction of Welsh in the national curriculum, particularly those teaching Welsh for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other projects supported include centres which provide intensive coaching for children moving into Welsh speaking areas and residential courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The package is in addition to the £3.06 million announced recently for Welsh language in-service training of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that the national curriculum is designed to improve standards—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) may be referring me to the Labour party's document, "Raising the standard", paragraph 7 of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If standards are to be raised, there has in our view to be much more effective monitoring and measurement of the current performance of schools."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 18 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the case for improved monitoring and accountability is accepted, we must ask why existing arrangements for this—through HMI and local inspectors and advisers—are inadequate to the task. How can we improve the present arrangements to raise standards and create better schools?"</p></blockquote>
Well, we know how to improve the present arrangements. That is why the Education (Schools) Bill introduces a revised system of school inspections to be undertaken by inspectors registered for that purpose by HMI. That system will lead to published inspection reports of a far greater number of schools much more regularly. What is more, we are strengthening the importance and power of HMI by creating a new office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools in Wales, which will be quite separate from that in England and independent of the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the work of HMI in Wales, but I must point out that, if we continued the present system, at the current rate of inspections secondary schools would be inspected once every 38 years and primary schools once every 52 years. That is unacceptable and why we are introducing the reforms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am encouraged by the enthusiasm that the further education and sixth form colleges in Wales are showing for their new status and the challenges that await them. Again, our goal is flexibility and efficiency in the provision of effective education. The full independence which we propose to give them from 1 April 1993 will free them to respond more rapidly to the changing needs of both students and employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal of work for the Further Education Funding Council and the colleges to prepare for incorporation next year. I shall be looking for close partnerships to develop between the funding council and local education authorities, which will retain their responsibility for sixth form provision in schools and for much of adult education. The colleges, too, will need to work with the LEAs, in an equal partnership, to ensure that the needs of people in their localities are adequately met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding council will also look to the training and enterprise councils for information about the needs of employers and how provision should he developed to meet those needs. In turn, the TECs will need to work closely with individual colleges to ensure that their skills and expertise are brought to the attention of students and employers. We simply cannot afford the loss of productive talent which would result from significant numbers of young people leaving school at 16 for jobs which offer no further learning opportunities or scope for progression. We must move rapidly so that it becomes the norm for young people to continue their education to the age of 18, as happens in the United States and many other advanced countries. The framework that we are now putting in place will, I believe, help to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the area of higher education we are engaged in reforms of equal magnitude. They will come in two stages. The first is the transfer out of the local government sector of the polytechnic of Wales and the five major colleges of higher education. That will take place on 1 April, in seven weeks' time. The second stage will happen a year later, in April 1993, when the
*<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
so-called binary line between the universities and the other higher education institutions will disappear and the Higher Education Funding Council for. Wales will take over responsibility for funding all the higher education institutions in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The institutions themselves are looking forward to the managerial freedom that independence will bring and they have recruited the highest-ever numbers of students in the current academic year. Over 26,000 students are now enrolled on courses at these colleges, which is an increase of 16 per cent over the previous year's figure of 22,500. Those who argue about real terms or GDP deflators should remember that there were 14,000 students in 1980, compared with 26,000 students now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly pleased that the increase in enrolment is across a broad base of subjects, including such key areas as engineering. In previous years there have been difficulties in recruiting enough students to meet the needs of industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To fund the colleges in 1992–93, I have allocated £44.4 million in recurrent and capital grant to the seven independent colleges, including Trinity college, Carmarthen. Those seven colleges will also receive an estimated £28 million in tuition fees, making a total figure of some £73 million of Government funding for the next financial year.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am determined that our higher education sector in Wales should he second to none in the United Kingdom and Europe. That means that we must give high-quality research capability a special significance. It is an important element in attracting advanced technology companies to Wales. There is room for the colleges to improve their record in the following respect, to which the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith), who has much inward investment in his constituency, should pay particular attention. I want colleges to attract academics of the highest quality so that the institutions in Wales come to be seen as a home for high-powered research with an international reputation, and as institutions to which industry turns naturally for consultancy and advice. At the moment we have three departments which are reckoned to he of international standing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will have seen recent
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
press reports that referred to the ranking system operated by the Universities Funding Council. Will a new ranking system be introduced of which the new Welsh Higher Education Funding Council approves? That would ensure that there is a broad range of research in all the higher education institutions in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is primarily a matter for the universities. I was discussing research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present Wales has three institutions of world renown. I issue a challenge to higher education colleges—by the year 2000 I want to see 10 times as many colleges. That should be possible if we focus on the present objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not discussed nursery education, which is attended by 70 per cent of children, training, teachers' pay—which I discussed on Monday—or several other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is at the top of the Government's list of priorities. I believe that what I hae outlined today confirms that and the fact that our policies pay special regard to those features of the education system in Wales which give it a quite distinctive character. We have a good record, we are proud of what we have achieved and we intend to press on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. At our previous sitting we faced the same problem that confronts us now, namely, the inefficiency of the Welsh Office and especially of the Secretary of State for Wales, who presented documents that were relevant to the debate—about rural Wales—on the day that the Committee sat. On that occasion I was so disgusted that I walked out of the Committee. We are in the same position today. The Secretary of State spoke for half an hour, but he made little reference to the "Review of Educational Provision in Wales". He presented that document to us this morning with the expectation that we should read 20 foolscap pages. His attitude to members of the Committee is disgraceful. It is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ruled on that matter earlier. It is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document that Her Majesty's inspectorate produced, to which the Secretary of State failed to refer, is important. The right hon. Gentleman should have ensured that we received it, at the very latest, last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman should have considered the good and the bad that lies between the covers of the report. The inspectorate, which is impartial, made some disturbing comments. It stated that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the work seen in schools during the year … 3 per cent was considered poor … The vast preponderance of teaching and learning was of satisfactory quality though little outstanding work was observed … The small areas of serious weakness needed more external intervention and support … there is unevenness in the work from class to class within schools and subject departments. Insufficient non-contact time for teachers, particularly in primary schools, and the pace of change are partly responsible."</p></blockquote>
I cannot quote everything in this lengthy document, but those are serious criticisms. Paragraph 9 of the report continues:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nonetheless, concerns persist in many schools about the adequacy of funds allocated through the application of the formula, the possible detrimental effects upon staffing levels, the burden of administration, and the continuity of valuable services, such as Welsh and music teachers."</p></blockquote>
Moreover, there were "constraints on provision" in a number of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to standards; yet I note that, towards the end, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Insufficient attention continues to be given to the causes of uneven standards and underachievement, and to specific strategies to counteract them."</p></blockquote>
Where are the Secretary of State's strategies to counteract the problems indentified by Her Majesty's inspectorate and now made available to the people of Wales—the very information that the Secretary of State did not make available to the Welsh Grand Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Peripatetic services remain in place, but not unscathed."</p></blockquote>
The report also deals with special educational needs, a subject on which I would expect the Secretary of State to work hard. In that area of education, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the majority of schools, however, provision is less satisfactory. There is a great deal to be done to identify the learning difficulties of pupils more precisely and prepare individual programmes of work for them which are well sequenced and meet NC objectives."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman has a very grave responsibility for these children. He has published the document but not enabled us to debate their future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in Mid Glamorgan and many other LEAs in Wales, there are great fears about the fact that LMS does not rule specifically about extra costs that have to be met by schools for children with special educational needs—for modification of equipment and the payment of peripatetic teachers and therapists who play such a vital role? Who will pay for those services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend poses a very important question and I shall pose some more for the Secretary of State to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 18 of the report deals with the crumbling of schools, an issue that the right hon. Gentleman has not resolved satisfactorily. Having referred to recently refurbished school premises, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In contrast, a large number of schools bear evidence of the further deterioration of buildings over another year in which there has been only limited maintenance and redecoration."</p></blockquote>
That might apply to my hon. Friend's constituency. I have certainly visited deplorable schools in which our young people have to be educated. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that people are only young once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another passage from the document that the Secretary of State did not want us to see deals with teacher supply:
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Very few applicants come forward for secondary posts in science. mathematics, music, modern foreign languages and Welsh as a second language."</p></blockquote>
I shall quote further passages from the document which—I must reiterate the point—the right hon. Gentleman clearly did not want us to be able to debate in Committee, even though he has known of its existence for at least a fortnight:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the secondary stage also, however, there is some evidence of the relative neglect of the creative/aesthetic subjects."</p></blockquote>
We are all anxious about teenagers. What does the report say about that subject? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The interests of young women, though increasingly recognised, are still inadequately catered for."</p></blockquote>
I must tell the Secretary of State that he is responsible for major defects in our school service and elsewhere. He has avoided serious issues; he has been discourteous to the Committee; he has given the impression of wriggling and evading. It is unforgivable for a Secretary of State to come before the Committee without previously having made available to it such an important report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John P. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that none of us had had time to consider the report properly, which is outrageous. May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to paragraph 114 on page 14. It makes a devastating indictment in relation to further and higher education in Wales:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Standards of work are being affected adversely by inadequate resourcing in over half the courses inspected"</p></blockquote>
in Wales. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Secretary of State should be made to comment on that today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and I shall give way to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not one to brush off criticism. However, when the hon. Gentleman states that I did not want him to read the document, he should remember that he is able to quote from it today only because I provided him with a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resourcing is done from local education authorities. I devoted a large part of my speech to announcing the real terms increases in resources that have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman accused me of selective quotation. Let me remind him of the first and main finding outlined in paragraph 1 on page 17:
	<br><blockquote><p>"About four-fifths"—</p></blockquote>
that is, 80 per cent—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the work inspected in schools…was satisfactory or better."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One in seven boys leaves school with no GCSE qualifications. The backlog of repair and maintenance work in our schools is estimated to cost more than £200 million. Last year, over 1,700 primary classes comprised more than 31 children. Education authorities are being forced to sell off school playing fields to make ends meet. Among inward investors, there is growing anxiety over our skills base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced the national curriculum without the preparation, time or resources
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
required to make it work. In 1989, more than £1.5 million was spent on the assisted places scheme to send Welsh children to public schools. Parents have become bewildered by the never-ending educational experiments on their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again, the Conservative Government have ignored the unique educational history and traditions of Wales. We have had half-baked ideas imposed by diktat from Whitehall. The Government's proposals to privatise the school inspectorate have no support in Wales. I also say that those proposals are ill thought-through, misguided and potentially disastrous for educational standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State talked about the need for debate within education. Had he met the 12 or so HMIs who came to the House just two weeks ago, he would have found that there was no support whatever for proposals to privatise the inspectorate. Moreover, I know that parents, teachers and even pupils in my constituency—whether in the state or private sector—are appalled at the idea of privatising Her Majesty's inspectorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely appalling. The objectivity of the inspectorate is now to be replaced by a market for school inspection on a commercial basis. Commercial organisations will be bidding for business. The regulators will be chosen and paid for by the very schools that are being inspected. The bad school could choose an inspection team with the aim of covering up its mistakes rather than exposing them to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many inspectors throughout Wales are deeply worried. Small wonder that this creeping privatisation has been almost universally condemned. The Society of Education Officers has expressed its anxiety over the proposals. It is a professional society which represents all directors, deputy directors and most other education officers in Wales. The society is on record as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Educational standards in Wales will he best served by maintaining a strong inspectorate, and not by a reduction of its strength and the weakening of its role. There is a real opportunity for the Secretary of State to demonstrate that he recognises that the education scene in Wales is different."</p></blockquote>
That is the message that we give the Secretary of State today. The right hon. Gentleman has not taken his opportunity. As with so many other policy issues, the Welsh Secretary of State from The Wirral is effectively putting party before Wales. The bilingual culture of Wales makes extra demands on the work of the inspectorate which would not adequately he met by a commercialised, privatised system of inspection. This bilingualism calls for a sensitivity of approach which cannot be exercised by an inspectorate that is unfamiliar with the Welsh language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the sensitivity of approach to bilingualism and the Welsh language. He will welcome the statement in the report, in relation to teaching Welsh as a second language, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the best progress is made in that minority of classes where Welsh is employed from time to time in learning across the curriculum."</p></blockquote>
That is important. Will the hon. Gentleman join me in welcoming the consensus in Wales on the Welsh lan-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
guage and dissociate himself and his party from the venomous campaign of the "Education First" movement, so called, and the divisive activities of his hon. Friend the Member Carmarthen (Mr. Williams)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rarely regret giving way in a debate, but on this occasion I do. If my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) seeks to catch your eye, Mr. Hughes, he will certainly make his opinions well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Together with our other unique education traditions, Wales should be exempted from these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no consultation before the Education (Schools) Bill was published. The Government have not published the report on which the Secretary of State claims the changes were based. I call on the right hon. Gentleman once again, to publish the review on the Welsh inspectorate because it is so important to the future of education in Wales that it should have been a White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of the inspectorate and the way in which it is allowed to influence Government policy provides a bastion against the growing control of education by the Government. Even now, the right hon. Gentleman should think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The teachers pay rise has been mentioned. I am sure that many teachers in Wales, although happy with the news, will reflect that the last time that they received a significant pay rise was just before the 1987 General Election. We have seen it all before. It is another cynical Tory exercise: give a little money out now, bribe your way to the ballot box and then claw it back until the next General Election comes around. That is the Conservatives' tactic and technique.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Government is the Secretary of State of bogus charters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After more than a decade of Conservative Government, thousands of children continue to be taught in crumbling schools. It is not good enough for the Government to try to blame others for falling standards. The Government are the government of crumbling schools. Too many of our children are being taught in substandard accommodation. According to the Welsh Joint Education Committee, the backlog of repair and maintenance on Welsh schools now stands at a staggering £200 million. It is a tribute to staff and parents that teaching standards remain so good given the Victorian conditions in which many children are expected to learn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that even the HMI report contains a major weakness? Very little is said about libraries in Wales. There is a brief mention about libraries in colleges being too small. It is not sad that this review of educational provision in Wales is produced by the inspectorate while the key to adequate provision in schools is often having a first-class library? No doubt my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
will agree that there is a considerable difference between libraries in the so-called public schools and those in Welsh schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. My hon. Friend will agree with me that our children deserve better than draughty classrooms, peeling paint and leaking roofs. Far too many Welsh children experience that daily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have travelled throughout Wales listening to parents and teachers and looking at the excellent work that they do. I have been impressed by their dedication and hard work. I have also been appalled at some of what I have seen. It is proof that the Conservatives, safe in the knowledge that their children go to public schools, could not care less about state schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example Mid-Glamorgan has 90 schools which were built before 1903. Builth Wells primary school was built in 1911. There is no playing field, no canteen and only one toilet for 18 female staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, Llay Park junior school, suffers from rotting windows and a leaking roof. This prompted a local campaign to put matters right by having the school remodelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After listening to the Secretary of State and his colleagues, I am of the view that the Government are the Government of double standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party believes that every child deserves the best possible education, but knows that the Conservatives believe in first-class education for a few and a second-class education for the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assisted places scheme is an example of the Government's double standards. The Welsh Office has allocated £1.9 million for the scheme this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Secretary of State explain why, on the Welsh Office's own figures, an average of £2,500 per pupil was allocated under the assisted places scheme last year, when average spending on a state school pupil that year was, according to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, £1,450? Is not this another example of Conservative double standards?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to see the development of a nursery education programme with the aim of giving every three and four-year-old whose parents want it a nursery education. A Labour Government would create a reading recovery programme to ensure that children were
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
reading by the age of seven and that those with reading difficulties were given help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Secretary that with the record that his Government have, his junior Ministers will lose their parliamentary seats. After 13 years of ministerial toil, the Minister of State, the Celtic steamroller, is grinding to a halt. We know that he is beaten and baffled. We know that the Under-Secretary of State will be catapulted from his constituency and from ministerial office. He will not survive—his exasperated electorate will see to that. They do not like over-confidence or arrogance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Soon the Welsh Secretary of State from the English Wirral will be but a shadow. The electorate in Wales has lost patience with these Ministers. The people of Wales are impatient with crumbling schools, resentful of the poll tax and angry at the prospect of hospital trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In truth, the people of Wales need a Labour Government. They want a change, and they want a Welshman in No. 10 Downing Street. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition will be Prime Minister, and that Conservative Ministers are doomed to opposition soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Grist 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a most extraordinary speech by the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones). I remember him being a junior Minister in the last Labour Government when, like some third-world pauper, we had to crawl to the International Monetary Fund to bail us out. Teachers' pay rose by only 6 per cent. instead of the 33 per cent that it has risen under this Government. I remember the hon. Gentleman cringing on the Front Bench when he had to make excuses for his Goverment's failure to pay what they had promised in the past—and what they now so glibly promise for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remember that HMI reports at that time were infrequent and secret. Members of the Committee could not have received reports similar to those that we have received today, because they were kept secret. The present Government opened up education—as they have opened up other areas of public life—away from the caucus rule in which Opposition Members have always believed—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]
This subject was debated barely a year ago on my birthday. What struck me about the speech made by the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside on that occasion was that he referred to various social problems—smoking, solvent abuse, alcohol misuse, vandalism, truancy, school violence—to which he has not referred today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bullying is certainly a serious problem, to which local authorities pay far too little attention. We should pay attention to it here. The hon. Gentleman also failed to deal with one of the most worrying aspects of education in Wales—the long-term problem of young people leaving our schools with too few or too low qualifications. Of course, we are improving. Statistics show that never before have so many children stayed on so long, reaching better standards of education and going on to higher and further education. However, we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
are still not meeting the targets that we should in relation to the rest of the United Kingdom or indeed in comparison with most of our competitor countries. We should pay careful attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has an important socio-economic aspect, which is one of the reasons why the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) made a point about Mid-Glamorgan. I must say in passing that I have never understood the wretched exam taken in Mid-Glamorgan. Every time that those exams take place, it leads to the queston why the same number of passes in relation to GCSE—or GCE in the past—is not attained. My impression is that nobody outside Mid-Glamorgan understands it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands (Merthyr Tydfil and Ryhmney)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The certificate of education in Mid-Glamorgan offers a form of qualification for a large number of children who would otherwise leave school without any qualifications. Under the present GCSE system, employers do not consider anything below a grade C to be a qualification of any sort. The special exam in Mid-Glamorgan at least provides some pupils with some form of qualification. However unsatisfactory, it is better than nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. However, I suspect that quite a number of children who take that special certificate would be capable of sitting the main national and more widely understood examinations. I fear that it has been made an excuse, which could be a hindrance to some young people who may want to go outside the Mid-Glamorgan area, as the special qualification is not widely appreciated away from that specific area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the answer to establish school-leaving qualifications that are generally recognised, rather than rest them entirely on the GCSE? It is one of the great absences in our secondary school education system. We need to establish school-leaving qualifications, not just to base them on GCSE.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman in that respect, but GCSE should be the prime public exam as it covers a wide range of subjects that would meet most needs. We still have a grave national problem with maths, physics and the sciences more generally. Languages are another important problem area. My hon. Friend the Minister has devised a new training scheme for acquiring skills in foreign languages. A press release states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some language teachers in Wales will have linguistic retraining."</p></blockquote>
It seems that some of them will have to do it from the floor up. The press release continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The national curriculum now ensures that all secondary school pupils learn at least one foreign language."</p></blockquote>
Frankly, I very much doubt that. Many people, including myself, passed O-level French, including oral French: but I would hesitate to enter a French shop to order anything but the most simple goods. We have an abysmal record on teaching languages in Britain. We must buck our ideas up, as it is shaming when people from other countries appear on our television and radio programmes time and again. Even people on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
street in countries such as Hungary can be interviewed in English. Many British people cannot even speak a modicum of French, let alone Hungarian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, as my hon. Friend has said, we have had a good fist as a Government. We have ensured that the teaching profession is properly rewarded so that we can attract the right people into education and have some choice over who enters the profession. Unfortunately, some people came into the profession faute de mieux—I regret to say that they could not think of anything else to do—and have been a nuisance ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also cracked down on the bureaucracy of county hall and the tight rule of local authorities there. We have promoted the power of parents and therefore of children too. Problems remain, however, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State spoke of parents and governors, but I wonder how many people we shall attract into the voluntary bodies. I am deeply worried about that. I know that the magistracy is now finding it difficult to attract sufficient people. The same applies in other public bodies—it is not easy to attract people of the right calibre and spread, or people who do not have axes to grind. My main fear in education is precisely that—some of the parents who take an interest in serving on voluntary bodies will have axes to grind. Such people must be avoided at all costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new curriculum is bedding down. It should be a matter for mutual congratulation that that has not been an issue of party rancour. We have all wanted to advance it. The Welsh Office also deserves a pat on the back for its decisions on music in the national curriculum. It is rather nice to be used as a stick with which to beat the Department of Education and Science on that matter. I congratulate my right hon. Friend who was probably responsible for that action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also delighted that, at long last, links between industry and education have grown. TECs have been involved with compacts and other means which have enabled children to see the connection between their life at school and the life that they will lead when they have finished school or university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although education is not solely about gaining qualifications and a job, that is a major part of it. People have to get a job and earn a living. Of course, we also want education to furnish young people's minds with interests outside their jobs. Nothing is more deplorable than a person approaching retirement who lacks any interests or hobbies in life outside work. When that happens, it means that education failed such people when they were young. The glories of life and the interest of nature may pass such people by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more flexibility in our education system. We have a good deal of it now, as people are able to get back into education. If they make a hash of school, there is chance for them to return to it. People can get back into further and higher education and into the university system. There are now more adult students at university. Whether through evening classes, the Open university or whatever, people are pursuing qualifications and interests which they had perhaps not understood or appreciated when they were younger. Retraining and reskilling are vital for the country as

well as for individuals. The Government have successfully set out in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given many of the thoughtful observations from the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist), it is a pleasure to follow him. I may pick up one or two of his points that need to be developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One image of our nation by outsiders is that we have always placed a special value on education. We are told, "You Welsh prefer, like and believe in education." I do not know how that image emerged; I have not had chance to trace its history and origins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I was aware of that image from my earliest days. I felt it through the obsessional parental drive behind me—for me to get on, to be educated and to qualify. My parents believed that the way to climb out of the pile was through education, not through earning money. That sort of image and belief—which was probably born in the 1930s and 1940s—has given us our distinctive nature and character and has placed education at the centre of our personality and identity. That is not only because we have our own language but because, in the broadest cultural terms, education was regarded as part of the Welsh personality and identity. Therefore, anything that fundamentally, affects educational development in our society affects our Welsh personality—our national identity. That belief was probably best captured in what some would regard as an out-of-date image: Emlyn Williams' "The Corn is Green"—and the passionate belief of a schoolteacher that a youngster had the ability to do greater things and helped him in that. That has been part and parcel of the intrinsic image of Welsh education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that education was profoundly meritocratic. The Government's policies on class league tables between schools seem genteel when compared with the 11-plus of the Rhondda in 1950–51 when not only class league tables but individual results were published. At the age of 10 or 11 we knew exactly where we stood as individuals in the whole of the Rhondda. Incidentally, one of the most poignant comments on my family's education is that my mother was the brightest of us all: she passed higher than any of us and yet she left school at 14. That was the saddest indictment of a system that did not allow people's talent and abilities to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must admit that that meritocratic system, which was based on the grammar school—whatever its virtues may have been—wrote off thousands of young people who were regarded and treated as failures. We never managed successfully to develop a secondary school system that offered—perhaps as the Germans did in the 1950s—a genuine, technical education that was admired, respected and believed in by the rest of society. That was what was wrong with the crude division resulting from the 11-plus and the grammar and secondary schools system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, for a whole generation of post-war so-called 11-plus failures, there was an alternative system. It is an aspect that the Committee should consider. That alternative system was outside the school: a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
manufacturing and training base offered alternative opportunities—an alternative education—for almost the earliest school-leavers. We saw the growth of apprenticeships in what is now British Gas and mining colleges were promoted by what is now British Coal. Indeed, telecommunications—the Post Office—the whole range of manufacturing industry and the public sector corporations offered an alternative system of education and picked up a large number of those who, in school would have been considered failures because of the academic orientation of the 11-plus system. They offered an alternative form of education, which also encouraged an alternative parental drive. I had the pleasure of being brought up by parents who encouraged me to get my O-levels and A-levels and to go on to university. In many of our communities parents were equally strongly driven in encouraging their children to get articles and apprenticeships. There was also a manufacturing infrastructure in place to pick up a whole generation of kids who would otherwise have been written off. That combination, in an oddball way, managed to develop the belief that education answered many of the needs of our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have provided a personal and anecdotal account of the way in which our educational system developed. But if my account was not far wrong, we should now take stock and ask how present needs are being met. I want to identify several fundamental changes that have endangered the belief in and passion for education in our society. There have been arguments about the education offered in comprehensive schools. The main complaint was that they were huge and impersonal, but that is no longer a problem because demographic factors have led to changes in the size of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several issues worry me which have not been raised by either the Secretary of State or my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones). There used to be a great appetite for education, training and skills which was shared by parents and instilled into children at all levels. Gradually, thank God, we achieved higher employment levels in the 1950s and 1960s and a new generation found that jobs were available for those without qualifications and training—I do not condemn that. People found that they did not need to stay on at school to get a decent job and earn enough income to take part in the consumer society that was developing. As new jobs became available and a new manufacturing sector developed alongside the coal and steel industries, the same emphasis was not placed on the intrinsic need for education, skills and training. In the recessions of the 1980s we learnt how fragile such a development was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) is making interesting and thought-provoking comments. Does he agree that comprehensive schools, although they had enormous merit in themselves, and the extraordinary demerit of snuffing out all variety in the provision of state education, and that that was an additional factor leading to the deplorable results to which he refers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking from my experience as a parent, I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman. My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
children have done extremely well under the comprehensive system—like those of other hon. Members—so I can speak from experience. In some ways I despair. I have one son who wants to be a musician, one who wants to be a painter and a daughter who wants to dance—three potential careers that could be financially disastrous. I do not, therefore, believe that the observation of the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West is valid. Indeed, if anything was likely to standardise and create an image of total uniformity, it was the rigid way in which the national curriculum was to be applied. That would have destroyed potential diversity at 14 plus. We must regain our appetite for education at all levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing that has changed is the alternative education that I described—apprenticeships and training tied into the great public corporations and the manufacturing sector. That has collapsed as a result of changes in technology and in our economy. We do not have such a strong belief in education because of comparatively full employment in the 1950s and 1960s. Employment is declining rapidly as recession and technological change have destroyed jobs in the manufacturing sector which we expected to provide training. There has, therefore, been a collapse of training opportunities for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education system in the 1990s must carry a double burden and do more than it did in the 1950s and 1960s. We must try to reaffirm and rekindle an appetite for education and to build into our education system the training in science, technology and especially modern manufacturing which is no longer available outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but is not one of our difficulties the fact that we are trying to enthuse a young generation whose parents, as the hon. Gentleman described, in some ways rejected education and therefore do not have the enthusiasm to persuade their children to take an interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman leads me usefully and thankfully to my next point. I did not say that people rejected education. They found it easier to get jobs, so they did not believe strongly in education as the route through. We must ensure that the present generation of parents share that enthusiasm. The way to do that is through nursery education. It was an amazing omission on the part of the Secretary of State not to have mentioned that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did. I am sorry. The hon. Gentleman may not have been in the Room at the time, but if he checks 
	<i>Hansard</i> he will see that I referred to nursery education and said that 70 per cent of children in Wales attended classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must have been the most peremptory reference to what will be one of the central areas of development in the 1990s. If we are to reaffirm our appetite for education, it must begin with nursery education. I went to school at the age of three. I learnt to read at the age of three and the joy of learning to read opened up many opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Despite the Secretary of State's claim that 70 per cent of children in Wales attend nursery school, it is appalling that there are communities in my constituency which have no form of nursery education provision. It is not a priority for the Government. In recent correspondence I begged the Secretary of State to do something about areas in my community, but he dismissed my request by saying that nursery education was not a statutory requirement. It never will be, under this lot. We must make nursery education a statutory responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the role that nursery education can play in liberating women from their homes, which is extremely important, it has intrinsic value. From the earliest stage we must whet the appetite for education of child and parent alike. It is crucial that that should begin at nursery age and run through to junior school. Primary school teaching will be the key link in rekindling our appetite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal briefly with secondary education. The saddest aspect of the years 1979–92 is that what should have been, as Jim Callaghan called it, the "great debate" has turned into a series of prejudices that have resulted in half-baked policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is worse is that those half-baked policies-cum-prejudices are of foreign extraction. They came from an obsession with the ILEA and inner city problems: they came from the right-wing think tanks of Wandsworth and matched the "loony left" in London. Most of the argument has been irrelevant to Welsh education. I thought for some time that we had immunised ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the observations of Professor Gareth Elwyn Jones, who is professor of education at Aberystwyth. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wales ought to be in a position to capitalise on the much more sensible, consensual attitudes which are evident among teachers, administrators and inspectors and, indeed, Ministers, in Wales."</p></blockquote>
I believe that to be so until we had the nonsensical importation of right-wing, ideological nonsense on how to inspect our schools. The Minister of State failed us badly: I expect no more of the Secretary of State and the other Minister at the Welsh Office because both are Englishmen. The Minister of State has condoned the implementation of nothing but a crude, ideological form of educational prostitution—commercialising inspection. That is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is misleading the Committee by being so severe in his castigation of the proposals in the Education (Schools) Bill. Surely he knows that we propose an independent office of Chief Inspector of Her Majesty's Schools. He will be totally impartial and will register the inspectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want second-hand inspection through a series of commercial people who knock on doors and peddle their wares. Understandably, the Scots are not doing that. They believe in standards and want to uphold the principles of the national curriculum. The Scots are not borrowing the nonsense from Wandsworth and the Centre for Policy Studies. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
know that they are very much favoured by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, but we did not think that they belonged to the Minister of State. This is a rare occasion when we should follow the Scottish example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would the hon. Gentleman seek to achieve what is already envisaged in his own party policy document "Raising the Standards"? That advocates more frequent monitoring and inspection. We also want that. The proposals in the Bill are the only way to achieve that rate of inspection—every school should be inspected every four or five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the only way in Scotland and it need not be the only way in Wales. We can enhance the inspectorate and develop it at national level. If the inspectorate is undermined so will the whole local advisory service be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support many elements of LMs. There are some sensible ideas among the ideological rubble of the past 10 years which we can use. But we should not believe that our education system is a series of individual schools: it is more than that. A school is part of the community. We do not want the peripatetic service that goes with it to be broken up. In Merthyr we have developed music in a magnificent way under the umbrella of the country. We do do not want the fragmentation of our education system to lead to the belief that education is just a collection of schools. If we are to maintain our distinctive educational character we must not think that education is just a collection of schools. That attitude comes from the ideological argument—the cash-oriented, kindergarten view of having smaller classes by buying into the private sector. Most of our primary and junior schools will be the only schools available to children in our community. We must make those schools work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the central feature of what is desperately needed. If my analysis is right, there has been a collapse of meaningful training opportunities such as apprenticeships and the alternative education system that was a lifeline to a generation who did not pursue the academic route in the 1950s and 1960s but trained for skills. It is vital that schools and the education system take that up and carry if forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) intervened when I gently said that the worst thing would have been to impose the national curriculum through to the age of 16. I shall say it now with more force. If that rigid and essentially academically based system of education had been imposed on all post-14-year-olds in all our schools, it would have led to higher truancy and a mass exodus from schools. The Government seem to be backtracking. They realise that, as a result of the collapse of outside training, we shall have to build into our comprehensive education system a major new initiative at 14-plus for a technological achievement of the sort mentioned by the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist). As the hon. Gentleman said, we do not want our 16-year-olds to leave school with no qualifications. It is sensible that they have a variety of qualifications that are recognised by society. It is vital to develop and enhance school education for that age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
As part of our future Government policy, we shall reaffirm people's interest in and passion for education. Not only should we take justifiable joy in a person from the community of Merthyr winning a scholarship to study history at Jesus or a music scholarship to Magdalen; we should have an equal passion, joy and pleasure in our people wanting to study engineering, going into modern manufacturing production and helping to attract the new economy that is deperately needed in communities like Merthyr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to talk about rural education for two reasons, the most obvious being that my constituency is perhaps the most rural in Wales, and because those of us who live and work in rural areas are worried that education is sometimes thought to be the same throughout Wales. It is not. Rural areas need special attention from Ministers. I readily agree that rural areas are given attention on the cultural aspects of education, but they are not always given the resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in rural Wales value our teachers greatly and we welcome the Government's decision to accept the full recommendation of the review body on teachers' pay. I suspect that the teachers in my constituency will vote ethusiastically for a hung Parliament in the hope that there might be an election every year and that those recommendations will be accepted each year. I am sure that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) would agree that teachers in rural Wales have always been regarded with full professional status by the population. Teaching has often been regarded as a more honourable profession—more of a real profession—in Wales than in many other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, teachers have not been treated equally for salaries. Indeed, teachers' morale has been low for several years. The morale of teachers in rural Wales will not be improved if despite the acceptance of the review body recomendation we find next year that the local authorities have to lay off teachers because of a lack of money. The rate support grant settlement for 1992–93 has been disappointing, for Powys in particular—an increase of 6.1 per cent—which was compounded by a late announcement. In past years standard spending assessments have been announced in late November or early December. The announcement this year was on 13 January. Provisional figures were provided in December but they were changed by the Welsh Office on a weekly basis and so were of no value. Unfortunately, every change reallocated standard spending assessment away from Powys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
The Government's assessment of what ought to be spent in Powys has increased by 6.1 per cent. That is unfortunately a full 2 per cent below the average for the rest of Wales, and does not even cover the cost increases between this year and next. Furthermore, our credit approval in Powys, which determines the level of spending on capital—new school buildings included—has hardly increased at all and has been eroded in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Powys county council estimated that we needed to increase spending by £4 million to meet all the extra demands placed upon it by legislation, increases in pupil numbers at schools in the county and the economic recession, which is putting a burden on many services. It was never expected that it would be possible to increase spending by quite that amount, but it was hoped that there would at least be an extra £2 million available for the county. The rate support grant settlement has given Powys nothing other than cover for inflation between this year and next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that extra money has been allocated within Wales to meet the increased salaries for teachers, but it is beginning to look as though, in common with past assessments of spending needed for Powys, it will not meet the shortfall that will arise, and will not enable the increased salaries to be paid. I hope that the Secretary of State will tell us that the full cost of the increase will be met in Powys so that at the very least no additional shortfall will arise from the teachers' settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I willingly respond to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I ask him to take careful note of the true statistics, which merit further examination. Will he please, in particular, take account of the expected outturn in expenditure in Powys this year and measure that against the provision for next year? Will he also bear in mind that if my memory serves me right—I shall provide the exact figures this afternoon if I catch Mr. Speaker's eye during the debate on RSG—aggregate external finance in Powys will increase by about 20 per cent next year over this year? Those are substantial additional moneys, even before we consider the consequences of Monday's announcement on teacher's pay and the additional money then provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlile</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Secretary of State's intervention. I shall, of course, examine the matters that he has mentioned insofar as I have not done so already. I emphasise that my comments until now have been based on the assessment by the chief officers of Powys county council of the county's position this year. If the full cost of the teachers' pay increase is not specifically met, needed teachers will have to be laid off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn briefly to other aspects of education and especially the village schools in rural Montgomeryshire. Over the years Welsh Office Ministers have at least paid lip service to the quality of education provided by village schools. I recall the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts), the Minister of State, rightly paying tribute to the standard of education provided by many village schools in rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Montgomeryshire value our village schools greatly. They continue to provide a high standard of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
education. They also provide a level of discipline and instill in children a level of self-discipline that is not evident in many larger schools. It would be a tragedy if the county council, because of a shortage of money, was forced to close village schools that still have viable school rolls and are still very much an integral part of villages. There are many village schools with 30 or more pupils that are now combining some resources, for example, physical education resources and sports competitions, and which remain valuable as good educational institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time that Ministers gave a specific commitment on the future funding of village schools, because they have not done so for the past nine years. Realistically, we know that village schools are quite expensive in some respects. However, there is an overwhelming case for retaining them on educational, community and social grounds, and that should be recognised by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the concern about primary schools and special educational needs that is expressed in the "Review of Educational Provision in Wales, 1990–91" published this morning. It states on page 17—this has already been quoted—that although in the majority of schools the provision is not as satisfactory as it might be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a great deal to be done to identify the learning difficulties of pupils more precisely and prepare individual programmes of work for them."</p></blockquote>
Statementing is an excellent thing and many parents have sought to take advantage of it. However, it is not excellent that local education authorities are not always able to respond as they would wish to on statementing. It is no good for a top-class school psychologist to prepare a report and make recommendations—which may involve special education outside the county—if they cannot be put into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Raffan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree strongly with the hon. and learned Gentleman's comments about special needs, especially dyslexia, although it is difficult to get local education authorities to define dyslexia. LEAs should, especially after LMS and their reduced role, undertake thorough research and surveys to identify special needs and the pupils who need extra teaching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlile</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman entirely and I am glad that there is cross-party support for that, albeit from the demob section of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about secondary education in Montgomeryshire through the medium of Welsh. The provision is very good. In Caereinion high school at Llanfair Caereinion, there are excellent facilities and they are taken up by pupils. That is welcome. However, it is of concern to me, to the local education authority, to councillors and, I hope, to the Secretary of State that there is no facility in Montgomeryshire for children to go to schools where teaching is exclusively through the medium of Welsh. There is a finely balanced argument about whether that facility is necessary because of the provision that is already made. However, many parents are dissatisfied because their children cannot go to Welsh-medium-only schools.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Elsewhere in Wales parents have that right. It is a difficult issue and I do not have a ready answer, but I hope that the Welsh Office will consider the problem in Powys and Montgomeryshire in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heartily agree with what has been said about foreign language teaching. Far too few pupils in Montgomeryshire learn French properly, almost none learn German and none—zero, zilch—learn Spanish. That is extraordinary, especially as Spanish is now the western world's second language. Yet no children in my constituency or in my county are able to learn it at school. There must be a modern language initiative in Wales. The Secretary of State knows that periodically I table questions to tease out the exam rates in modern languages. There has been some improvement, but there is a long way to go before it can be considered that enough is being done in Wales to teach the languages needed for the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will welcome the latest scheme, which is designed to encourage teachers whose main qualification may not be in a modern foreign language but whose knowledge could be brushed up to teaching standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlile</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome it, but teaching by dustpan and brush is not a good structure for education. The Minister of State will recall that at one time there was a strong initiative to encourage the teaching of French in primary schools. It failed because the teachers were only one step ahead of the pupils and had no skill in the teaching of that language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Language teaching is not simple it can be done successfully only by trained language teachers. It is not enough to teach the language of the café or the newsagent. We need to produce pupils from Wales who can make a full contribution to the Europe of the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to speak about students, and especially undergraduates. In the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells), there are two university colleges, which are great Welsh educational institutions. Many of my constituents are affected by the desparate shortage of accommodation in Aberystwyth, as well as by the funding of courses. That shortage is so acute that many students have to commute on the inadequate railway services or drive their beaten-up old cars very long distances to their lectures or tutorials. They cannot afford the very limited accommodation that is available in Aberystwyth. Housing benefit is no longer available. We are breeding a new generation of undergraduates who are effectively down and out while they are studying. There is very little work for them to do, even if they had the time to do it, by means of which they could earn extra money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Student loans impose an extra burden. The system is not working. Many parents do not undertake the full responsibility of helping to maintain their children while they are students. That is a serious problem at universitities and colleges throughout the country. Students effectively have no means of forcing their parents to pay up. As a result, students in Wales, and especially in Aberystwyth, are in serious difficulty. The Government must help them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To compound the problem, undergraduates are unable to find even the most menial job to see them through the summer holiday, yet the Government have withdrawn all their rights to benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlile</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I do not want to be churlish. There have been improvements, especially in education in Welsh. We welcome the difference in the national curriculum for music between Wales and the rest of Great Britain. We hope that resources will be available to sustain the great musical tradition of schools in Wales.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Views on the education system depend upon the points of view of those looking at it. My views are coloured by my experience as a student. I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) about student accommodation. A young student friend of mine twice had to call the environmental health department to the property in which he was staying in the great city of Cardiff—not Aberystwyth. That is a general problem and it is deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One's point of view depends on one's experience. I speak as a student and as a teacher in adult, community and higher education. This morning, I want to consider the progress made over past the past 20 years—progress made by both parties, so those on the Opposition Front Bench should not get excited—in creating an autonomous Welsh education system. As of last night, with the Second Reading of the Further and Higher Education Bill, we now have such a system. The voluntary nursery sector has always been supported by Welsh Office funding. The primary, secondary, further, higher and community education and training sectors are all in place in the structure. That provides the opportunity to develop the diversity of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's problem is that it has concentrated on attacking the Welsh Office for implementing Conservative education policies in Wales. Later this year, I hope to write about how the Welsh Office has created a relatively autonomous Welsh system by behaving in a manner different from that of the Department of Education and Science, despite the fact that the primary legislation that set the context was similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the Education Reform Act 1988, the national curriculum and the Curriculum Council for Wales, different curriculum content and policy has emerged. I criticised the Minister of State when he answered my question about the meaning of national curriculum by saying that when it was used in England, it meant England and when it was used in Wales, it meant Wales. I now know that that was true, though I did not realise it then. The difference has been achieved through the more consensual approach to which Professor Gareth Elwyn Jones referred. I am glad that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) picked up on that point in the 
	<i>Western Mail</i> article.

The relative consensus within the Welsh system and the way that Ministers and officials have worked by agreement and debate contrasts with the activity of the Department of Education and Science. Far be it from me—although I will do it—to lecture the Department of Education and Science. It has much to learn from the Welsh system about managing education policy and the teaching of languages, especially secondary and community languages, other than English in inner cities and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office behaved differently in the controversy surrounding HMI. A new HMI office has been created and the number of inspectors has been maintained. The system in Wales will allow flexible use of the skills of local inspectors and advisers to work on an all-Wales basis. There is much expertise, especially in bilingual teaching, in some authorities that other authorities lack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the Government about the need for more frequent inspection of schools. It is essential that each school is inspected every four to five years at least. Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that the registration or licensing system will lead to an uneven inspection of schools and that that is contrary to the fundamental responsibility of Governments to oversee fair educational opportunity for all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essential point is that the registration system should ensure that the people who will be involved in the inspection and the assessment work of the education system should employ methodology and standards that will spread national practice evenly. That seems an attraction of the system if there is a good relationship between the existing HMI and the advisers in the inspection service that will be retained by the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows from what has happened to the LMS and the reduction of the role of the LEA that that aspect of the service should also be available for local use. The reduction of the role of the LEA creates problems for some of those all-Wales organisations that have a particularly good track record. I refer to the Welsh Joint Education Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be accused of being biased but, having supported the Government last night on the Further and Higher Education Bill, I suppose that I shall be, even though I gave my reasons in my speech. However, when the Secretary of State, or his successor, considers the future structure of education, he or she should insist on not only the retention but the enhancement of the WJEC role. It pioneered a variety of activities, including its Welsh language division through Pwyllgor datblygu addysg Cymraeg. But with the potential reorganisation of local government and a smaller number of unitary authorities, the role of the all-Wales educational perspective outside the funding councils becomes more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The smaller unitary residual LEAs that I presume will result from that reorganisation will require a continuing role for the WJEC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman closely. He is in cloud cuckoo land when it comes to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
consequences of fragmenting the HMI. If one goes to the ultimate length of contemplating the break up of the education system into a mere collection of schools, logically there will be no uniform joint education authority because schools will buy their courses from anywhere and everywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that follows. The scale of the Welsh system and its formal and informal integration have remained relatively intact through the reform procedures that have been implemented by the Government. That is due to the Welsh Office's ability to function in a relatively autonomous way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comparisons with Scotland are not valid because the Scottish system has always been structurally different. The Welsh system was not structurally different from the English system but it has been able to behave differently through the devolved nature of the Welsh Office system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what the Secretary of State said about our higher education system. It is high time that those who are involved in Welsh higher education responded to the challenge set out today by the Secretary of State. When we consider our European motor regions partners, we note that they have a greater commitment to higher education institutions as centres of excellence and research than we have had in the university of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go over the old arguments about the historic reasons why we had no such developments in the past, but we should take up that challenge. That does not mean that we are reducing our commitments to learning in the general sense. Where places of learning are developed as centres of excellence, even if they are centres of philosophy, if one develops an ability to analyse social problems one also develops an ability to analyse results. Research is about both so-called pure research and applied research because both come together and spin off each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That applies to the basis of the education system in that we have both training and what used to be called liberal education together. I congratulate the Welsh Office and the curriculum council for having recognised the importance of maintaining the balance between the so-called vocational education and education for citizenship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of a more devolved system, we shall be able to maintain our cultural traditions in Wales—something that the Secretary of State welcomed this morning—and make new ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning we have heard three interesting, thoughtful and impressive speeches from Opposition Members. I say that not because I am demob happy, but because I happen to agree with much of their content, although, clearly. Opposition Members realise that I have mellowed in my old age. Whenever the hon. Member for Merionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) talks about devolvement, he knows that he has my immediate attention because I believe that it is important to pay due attention to the individual needs of the different

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
parts of the United Kingdom—I refer to the different regions of England as much as to Scotland and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know—as the Under-Secretary of State frequently tells the Welsh media—that I am a lone voice in the Welsh Conservative party. In fact I am not because I have the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) and of many others, if my mail is anything to go by. I am also aware that today's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy. We have seen that happen with the Government, not least with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, for whom I have great respect and admiration. I remember his sterling performances on the Floor of the House, some years ago, which persuaded me on the poll tax and now he has persuaded me, equally effectively, that I should support another tax. I am sure that, in the next Parliament, as Secretary of State, he will put on a sterling performance in this Committee and in the Chamber to show why the Conservative party has always been the party that stands for devolving power and responsibility from Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Merionnydd Nant Conwy and with the point made, forcefully and effectively, by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) about language teaching. Many members of the Committee were nodding their heads in response to what the hon. and learned Gentleman said. I remember, in my youth, long ago as that was, that languages were taught, for the most part, as written, rather than spoken languages. The O-level exam consisted of a 10-minute oral test and about four or five hours of written examination. That approach is wrong and must be changed. It has changed considerably since then, but we must also start teaching languages earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned that the Welsh experience is valid for England. I remember being impressed when I first visited a Welsh-medium school. The teacher asked the children a question in English and they answered in Welsh. At one point a child had to be given a gentle nudge on the head with a ruler to remind him to answer in English. Those children were totally bilingual. At that age, minds are more agile and more capable of absorbing the complexities of language. If we want to compete in Europe, we must become more aware of
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
that. The single market comes next year; European political and monetary union comes in the late 1990s. I know that, at the moment, my party takes a slightly different stance on that matter because of the need to cement together the different factions in this temporary pre-election period. Once that period is over, we shall wholeheartedly enter into political and monetary union. To play a full part in Europe, it is essential to speak other languages. When I go to France or Germany, my friends in those countries change language as they cross the border. I cannot do that, which is humiliating. We British must change our approach and become less insular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with what was said by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). He gave the Committee a broad-brush, but interesting and strongly-felt analysis of the genesis and history of Welsh education and he emphasised the importance of returning to "The Corn is Green" period when there was a real passion for education. Holywell High School, where Emlyn Williams was educated, is located in my constituency. I have always thought that that was right for Scotland, and—I hope that hon. Members will not mind me saying so, as a Scot—I think that we must try to revive that in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like many hon. Members, I spend considerable time in schools. I make sure that I spend at least one Friday in four in schools. I am happy to say that I have visited all seven secondary schools in my constituency three or four times and I have only two out of 56 primary schools left to visit; I shall visit those two next week. Those visits are important because that is how I obtain feedback from teachers and staff about our educational reforms and about areas for improvement. I know that the Minister also visits many schools. It is important that we consult widely. In general, I find strong support for our educational reforms—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
