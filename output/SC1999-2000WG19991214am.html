	<div class='title'>Pensioners</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>10.30 pm</p>

	<p>1. 
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he last met representatives of pensioners in Wales. [101525]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the interministerial group on older people and will shortly meet pensioners in Wales with my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Social Security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have done a good deal for pensioners. Their initiatives include the £100 heating allowance, free television licences for over-75s and improved funding for the health service. However, they have a long shopping list, which includes bus passes and restoring the earnings link to pensioners. Does my hon. Friend agree with the suggestion in the current issue of 
	<i>Saga Magazine</i> that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor should get two cheers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. The Government and the Chancellor made great efforts to help pensioners in Wales in the Budget statement. Some 580,000 pensioners will benefit from the £100 winter allowance and 236,000 over 75-year-olds will benefit from free television licences. The Assembly will introduce free bus passes for pensioners next year—ahead of England. That is a good record for the Government, and they should certainly get two cheers. We are committed to ensuring that we get the third cheer as soon as is practicable before the election, and afterwards, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The miners' compensation scheme for bronchitis and emphysema is of great supplementary value to many pensioners in the valleys. As a member of the monitoring group, I assure my hon. Friend that many of the settlements will be made quickly at the beginning of next year. The Government must be applauded for the positive way in which they direct resources towards older members of the community. Will my hon. Friend keep up the pressure on my right hon. Friend the Chancellor so that the money comes through quickly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his welcome for the money that the Government give to miners. We have taken speedy action on payments to them. Indeed, there has been a 20 per cent. real-terms increase in miners' pensions since the Conservatives privatised the pits and since this Government came to power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board my hon. Friend's points. I emphasise the Government's strong commitment to supporting retired miners and ensuring that they get the decent standard of living that they deserve for their efforts over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Trunk Roads</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>2. 
	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on the improvement of Welsh trunk roads which cross the English border. [101526]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The improvement of Welsh trunk roads is a matter for bilateral discussion between the National Assembly for Wales and the lead Whitehall Department in cases where decisions affect communities on the English-Welsh border. I keep in close contact with the National Assembly and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, but I would intervene only if I were asked to do so to help solve any difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take this opportunity to ask the Secretary of State to intervene, because I have a problem? The White Paper on the core network of trunk roads in Wales shows the A483. The road starts off in Wales and goes to an anonymous pink zone—we could call it the friendly zone or the happy Christmas zone, now that we are getting near to Christmas. The road comes out again at a little village called Llanymynech, down whose main street the border runs. The Government office of the west midlands told me that the road is of no interest, although an awful lot of people from the west midlands go to Wales down it. It is obviously a serious matter for Wales because it is part of the strategic network. Who do I talk to about the road and how do I get people to take seriously the chronic traffic problem in Llanymynech? Sometimes, it can take five minutes to cross the road there. Sadly, it is only a matter of time before there is a serious accident. Will the Secretary of State take a personal look at the issue and arrange a meeting with me and possibly my neighbour, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) to discuss the road and the future of a bypass for Llanymynech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the matter of transport and roads is devolved to the National Assembly. However, I take his point and will be happy to meet him and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to discuss the issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the A483 would have been far better had the previous Government invested in a dual carriageway rather than a single carriageway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the road to which my hon. Friend refers, and I am aware that the matter is of considerable concern to him and his local authority. I agree with him entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Flooding</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>3. 
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with Departments on introducing measures to reduce flooding in Wales and border areas." [101527]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter for the National Assembly for Wales in discussion with the lead Whitehall Department and the Environment Agency. Again, I would become involved only if I were asked to intervene to help resolve a difficulty. Until now, I have received no such request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that half of my constituency is currently underwater and that such flooding is happening more frequently? Does he share my belief that the problem is made worse by the statutory levels required of Clywedog dam? Would he support me in reducing those levels so that the dam overflows less often? That would ease the enormous flooding problem in the Severn valley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has already discussed this important matter with me. My powers under the Clywedog Reservoir Joint Authority Act 1963 include the order-making power to reduce the level of water in the dam. That power will be transferred to the National Assembly for Wales in the next transfer of functions order. However, in the meantime, the matter is still my responsibility and I am more than happy to meet the hon. Gentleman to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flooding in Wales has become a growing problem in recent years. In my constituency, villages such as Dinas Powys and Boverton have experienced flooding for the first time. There must be an explanation in climatic change or—I suspect—in major building development that lacks proper facilities for handling additional surface water. It has also been suggested that winter farming techniques are responsible. When winter corn is planted and fields are not furrowed—as they would have been in the past—the retention of water on large open spaces is restricted, creating a big problem. I trust that my right hon. Friend will bear those points in mind when he next has discussions on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will. My hon. Friend is right to say that Wales is getting wetter by the year. Some of his explanations for flooding are important. He can rest assured that, when I next meet the First Secretary, I shall ask him to discuss those issues with the Environment Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in regular contact with representatives of the Federation of Small Businesses in my constituency—and those for north Wales, as I know you are, Mr. Jones. Will my right hon. Friend explain how the research and development tax credit for small businesses announced in the Chancellor's pre-Budget report affects small business in Wales? Will he elaborate on how it affects my constituency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, of course, to say that the pre-Budget report contained several measures that will help small and medium businesses, including the tax credit to which she referred. The future of the Welsh economy relies greatly on the success of small and medium enterprises in my hon. Friend's north Wales constituency and elsewhere. The Cardiff partnership which, for example, is examining how to deal with objective 1 planning, is treating such
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
issues seriously. The Welsh Development Agency is examining carefully how small and medium businesses in Wales can help to improve the Welsh economy. I am sure that the matters raised by my hon. Friend will be important in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise the question of additionality of European funds with regard to the Welsh bloc. That is in relation not to objective 1—important as that is—but to agricultural programmes such as the Tir Gofal and organic aid schemes. Such schemes may receive up to of 50 per cent. assistance from European funding. Objective 1 areas such as Tir Gofal can receive as much as 70 per cent. European funding. The problem is that the European moneys that should be available to Wales are lost to the Treasury. If funds remained in Wales, we could double the number of farms entering the Tir Gofal scheme at a time when such assistance is desperately needed. I ask the Secretary of State to take the matter up with the Treasury and to press hard to ensure that Wales reaps the full benefit of the European designation. I hope that we can look forward to an announcement soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that additionality counts on a United Kingdom-wide basis. We have to look at how that affects the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales. I know the importance of Tir Gofal. I will ensure that his points are made when I next meet the First Secretary and the Assembly Secretary responsible for agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my right hon. Friend had any further discussions with the Welsh Assembly on the allocation of health resources? I am thinking particularly of deprivation as a factor because, unlike in Scotland and England, the Welsh allocation does not take deprivation into account. Areas like mine would benefit particularly from an allocation based on other factors, including deprivation. How quickly will the Assembly look at those matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I cannot speak for the speed of the Assembly, as that is a matter for the Assembly itself. However, the formula by which health resources are distributed throughout Wales has been raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) and for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith); the same factors apply in Gwent as they do in Cynon Valley. I have raised the issue with the First Secretary. He understands the point, and I am sure that those matters will be taken into account in the stock take of the health service in Wales that the Assembly has undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for his short, but illustrative response. Does he agree that, although the Opposition parties might scoff at the idea of partnership between the Assembly and Westminster, it is the only way in which to proceed if we want an integrated approach to government and if the Assembly is to make a significant difference to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that phrase was much at the forefront of my mind in my previous Northern Ireland post. It is also right for Wales now. Partnership—working together as a United Kingdom Government and Parliament on one hand, and having a National Assembly for Wales on the other—is the only possible way forward. When I travel around Wales talking to local authority members, business people, trade unionists, and people from the voluntary sector and the churches, I discover that they all believe that that is the proper way forward. It is important to have joint working groups between the Government in Westminster and the Government in Cardiff in order to deal with issues of common concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Secretary of State would agree that one of the Assembly's main shortcomings is the fact that it has no worthwhile input on rail services in Wales. We are going to have a Strategic Rail Authority, but I understand that there are to be no Welsh representatives on it. Will the right hon. Gentleman lobby the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions—and particularly Lord Macdonald, the new Secretary of State for Transport—to ensure adequate Welsh representation on the Strategic Rail Authority? We must be able to make some impact on rail services in Wales, which are totally inadequate at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about the importance of railways and the need to improve them in Wales. The National Assembly is looking into that.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basic framework of the Bill is the same for England and Wales because we share the common aim of revitalising local government by making it more efficient, transparent and accountable to local people. The new powers for local authorities to promote well-being, a strong ethical framework, new management structures and other provisions will help to achieve that aim in England and Wales. However, the Assembly will have specific powers under the Bill to mould the system to the Welsh environment. The Government are still discussing with the Assembly how the new framework can best be implemented in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to receive the answer to the question before the supplementary, although I am mainly interested in the management style. Will the Minister explain how democracy is furthered in Wales through the limited choices offered? Will he examine how Newport council is run?

With decisions being taken by smaller and smaller groups, how does the Minister believe that open debate and freedom of information are being furthered in Welsh local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point is that the hon. Gentleman has obviously not studied the Local Government Bill in detail.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Chancellor's announcement that he is abolishing the fuel duty escalator that was introduced by the previous Tory Government, despite all the noise that they have made about it since. The decision is of great importance to motorists in rural areas such as mine, who do not have ready access to public transport. Will the Minister discuss with the First Secretary ways of reintroducing to Welsh local communities the services that were lost under the market forces dogma of the previous Government, because the best way in which to reduce emissions and save energy is by ensuring that people are less reliant on their cars and can access local services immediately locally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend on a very thoughtful question. I agree also that the abolition of the fuel escalator will make a great difference to many parts of rural Wales. In addition, the Assembly has, as my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received some representations on the classification of lottery funding as an element in projects partly sponsored by European structural funds. I repeat that lottery funds are considered to be public expenditure whatever type of projects they co-finance. However, lottery funding scores against the budget of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, and the National Assembly will not have to provide public expenditure cover for lottery matched funding used in objective 1 projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that reply. He replied to a question from me on the subject in the Welsh Affairs Committee a few weeks ago. Afterwards, I had a letter from him stating something different. Today, his answer is slightly different again. Is this the right hon. Gentleman's final answer? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have got in the soundbite. It is vital that we obtain as much as possible of the public element—the additional funding and matched funding. I appreciate his explanation but it still leaves work to be done because, pro rata, the actual amount from the Department is small, so it seems that there will be a gap. Will the right hon. Gentleman comment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I indicated in my letter that I gave him the wrong information when last we discussed the matter. On the other hand, as I said earlier, the National Assembly will not have to bear the burden of any lottery funding. If, for example, a voluntary organisation decided to apply for some sort of project or scheme using objective 1 money and chose to use lottery funding as its portion of it, it is important that it has the opportunity to double or treble the funds, depending on the scheme. I think that that is a good thing, and something new to all of us in the relationship between lottery funding and objective 1 moneys. I believe that only good can come of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->

There is more than just symbolism about that, but the most important change is that this is our first Welsh Grand Committee since devolution. On a number of occasions there was a debate about whether the Committee should meet at all. The majority of Members representing Welsh constituencies see a value in the Welsh Grand Committee meeting from time to time to discuss those issues in which all of us, irrespective of party, have an interest. It also gives us the opportunity to discuss as Members representing Wales, the policies pursued by the Assembly in so far as they relate to the policies that are still the preserve of this Parliament and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly our collective roles, whether as Ministers, Members of Parliament or officials working in the various Government Departments in Whitehall, are fundamentally different from what they were seven months ago. They are hugely different in terms of our responsibilities. Reference was made in Question Time to partnership and how it can work. The first obvious case is how we represent our constituencies. However, whether we represent them here or in the Assembly, we represent the same people. Ultimately, the purpose of such representation is to improve the quality of life of our constituents. This Committee and the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs therefore have a role. The Select Committee meets the Assembly Chairs of Committees and I go to the Assembly to refer—as I must under the Government of Wales Act 1998—to the legislative programme, as I did a couple of weeks ago. The joint ministerial Committee also has a role. All that points to the importance of working together for the benefit of Welsh people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of Parliament still remains extremely important to Wales. We still have responsibility for primary legislation, and I will turn to that in a moment. We still have the responsibility to ensure that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the Budget, and how it affects Wales, is scrutinised in Parliament. That is fundamental to the working of the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that it would be improper for me to comment on the way in which the First Secretary and Assembly Secretaries work. I am assured that problems in fulfilling diary commitments were so enormous that they were unable to attend. The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that I was able to answer on behalf of Wales on appropriate matters. We are talking about an initial meeting in which the procedure was set up and details were not discussed. Future meetings will go into the requisite details and the National Assembly will, of course, be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall purpose is to underpin the settlement that was agreed by the people of Wales in a referendum. The Welsh people voted for a specific type of devolution, under which primary legislation was still the responsibility of this Parliament. Members of Parliament were still responsible, in the first instance, for scrutiny of budgetary matters affecting Wales. People agreed on that settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some functions—social security and the new deal, for example—were never transferred because it was proper for this Parliament to deal with them. Other functions—fiscal powers, law and order—were less pertinent to the Assembly, but vital to the people of Wales. It is entirely appropriate for this Welsh Grand Committee to debate the pre-Budget review and the legislative programme as they affect Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other important point is that all these devolution matters are part of a wider picture of constitutional change, which the Government were elected to implement during this first Parliament. That change embraced devolution in Wales and Scotland, reform of the House of Lords and the constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland. As we break up for Christmas, there will be an opportunity for members of the National Assembly for Wales and members of our Government in Westminster to attend the British-Irish Council, which will bring people from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
devolved Administrations together in an entirely new arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those changes in how we govern ourselves are for the better. Taking the opportunity to examine best practice in each other's Administrations will ensure better governance throughout Wales. Government in Wales is devolved in a special way, so that government is closer to the people while, at the same time, being linked more closely to us in Westminster and Whitehall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the remit of the British-Irish Council will be representing opinion from various Parliaments—from the Republic of Ireland, ourselves, Scotland and Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. There will be a parliamentary level for British-Irish arrangements. I sincerely hope that when we decide how best to put the arrangements into practice, Welsh Members of Parliament will be represented. We will also need to ensure that parliamentary representatives from Scotland and England have a role on the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the British-Irish Council—or the Council of the Isles, as it is sometimes called—has been raised and that the Secretary of State has spoken about the change of relationships between the different parts of Britain. However, are we not all caught up in a process that will change and evolve over time and will also be affected by changes at the European level? Does the Secretary of State welcome being caught up in such a process? Does he agree that it would be wrong to close the option of further changes in Wales and adding further powers, including legislative and fiscal powers, to the freedoms of the National Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the referendum provided an opportunity for the people of Wales to express their view about the sort of settlement that they wanted. That settlement showed pretty clearly that they wanted what was on offer and not, for example, what was on offer in Scotland. However, the majority for Welsh devolution was slender. We must therefore take into account the views of those who voted for devolution and give assurances to those who voted against it. The most important aspect of the settlement for us to concentrate on is how members of the National Assembly will spend £8 billion on services that they are charged to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am absolutely opposed to the next four years being taken up with an obsession with constitutional change, when we should be concentrating on the health service, schools, transport and local government. Such an obsession would be a constitutional cul-de-sac, which would do no one in Wales any good whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
devolution settlement was carried by only a slender majority. Our responsibility in Cardiff and London is to ensure that it works. In the next 10 years, the constitution must make the Assembly deliver for the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. As I said, between now and the election for the National Assembly in four years' time, we must ensure that the people of Wales have the services that they deserve. The test of devolution is not whether we spend the next few years arguing about different constitutional changes but about how, at the time of that election, the quality of life will have changed for Welsh men and women as a consequence of devolution. Whether Welsh people believe that their lives have changed for the better as a result of devolution is the test of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State agree that the quality of life in rural Wales has declined radically in the past four or five years? Farmers in Wales are now earning only £15 a week or 37p an hour, whereas the minimum wage is £3.50. An entire generation of young farmers is leaving the land and going to work in England and elsewhere. What will the Secretary of State do about that to improve the quality of life in Welsh rural areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the problems of rural Wales are acute, which is why the National Assembly has spent so much time dealing with them. However, the only way to tackle rural deprivation is via the Assembly and our own Parliament and Government working together—with, in this case, the European Community as well. We must tackle those problems as a partnership. The hon. Gentleman represents a large rural constituency, so is deeply conscious of such problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State spoke about structures and the relationship between Westminster and the Welsh Assembly. We heard that the nationalists are interested in devolving further powers to the Welsh Assembly. Indeed, they will not be happy until all power resides in Cardiff and Westminster has none. Will he give a commitment that no further powers will be devolved to the Welsh Assembly before the Welsh people have been consulted in another referendum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to give commitments about what happens in future. I can only give the hon. Gentleman my views. I believe that the Welsh people voted for what we have got when they voted for the settlement. They expect those in the Assembly to concentrate on dealing with frontline services and matters that concern all the Welsh people. If, in years to come, there are other ways that people wish to use to discuss such matters, it is not for me to stop that. However, between now and the next election for the Assembly, the people of Wales expect it to concentrate on dealing with spending £8 billion on services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for me to circumscribe debates in Wales and elsewhere. However, it is important for all of us who represent Wales to believe that our first priority is to improve the services that we are charged to protect. That is why the pre-Budget statement, which is one of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the reasons for this debate, is so important for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister issued his report "Sharing the Nation's Prosperity". It did not deal with the Assembly's responsibilities, but it did examine the Government's role in Wales. It stated that there has been an 11 per cent. increase in the financial and business services sector in recent years; that 42 per cent. of the United Kingdom's steel is still produced in Wales; that there has been growth in the electrical, electronic engineering and car component sectors, including in my constituency; that there has been inward investment; and that there are 76,000 jobs in overseas-owned plants, 40 per cent. of which are from the United States of America
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, I was in Nantgarw, where I launched a test facility for aeroplane engines. That facility represents a $35 million investment in Nantgarw and protects the jobs of 1,700 people. In Broughton, in your constituency, Mr. Jones, investment by British Aerospace is hugely significant. I recently visited Baglan, where investment by General Electric and others will ensure that we go into the next century with greater prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that does not mean that there is no room for improvement, because there is. Our unemployment is now closer to the UK average, but there is still an awful lot to do. Our gross domestic product per head is 82 per cent. of the United Kingdom average, and only Northern Ireland's is lower. We all know that the recognition of the deprivation of large parts of rural and urban Wales was an important reason why Wales was granted objective 1 status in the first place. That is why the combination of the pre-Budget statement and the Queen's Speech tells me that we have a great job of work to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our measures are based on the principles of enterprise and fairness. We need to improve skills and encourage enterprise. Yesterday, I was in Ogmore in Ogmore Vale and saw how Bridgend county borough council dealt with the important question of new technology. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor said in his announcement that nearly £2.5 million will be awarded to Wales under the new deal for schools. As a result of the capital modernisation fund, we have a new UK-wide telephone job brokering service and a venture capital fund, to which I referred during questions. We must match enterprise with fairness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Secretary of State leaves the question of enterprise, does he accept that the welcome huge new investments in sectors that have replaced the old extractive industries and given millions of Welsh people jobs—[HON. MEMBERS: "Millions?"]. Does the Secretary of State accept that there is prosperity in areas where extractive industries have closed thanks to the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s? Those reforms reduced the burden of taxation and costs to industry and therefore brought in businesses. The Secretary of State speaks in the Cabinet and has more time than previous Secretaries of State to reflect on the issue. Does he accept that keeping costs and tax down and making Britain and Wales competitive—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of the credit must go to organisations such as the Welsh Development Agency, which has encouraged inward investment in a way that no one in England or, indeed, the United Kingdom can match. The reasons for the prosperity that the hon. Gentleman described—this is certainly true of recent years—lie at the heart of the matter and of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's prudent management of our economy. Our rate of inflation is lower and the economy is more stable than ever. Those are the real reasons why we can take such encouragement in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, however, always balance enterprise with fairness. I am sure that my hon. Friends will agree with me about the fairness of a minimum pension guarantee that is uprated in line with earnings, of the £100 fuel allowance for more than 500,000 Welsh pensioners, of the free television licences for 250,000 over-75s and of the working families tax credit, which the Conservative Opposition would abolish if they were in government, but which means that 75,000 working parents are now eligible for an average of £22 a week. All those initiatives, be they on food, fuel, television or the tax credit, surely show that the Labour Government's commitment to fair play in Wales is very much at the heart of the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other institution that I am told the Conservatives would abolish is the new deal. I know too that in Wales it has been a huge success, with 22,000 young people taking part in it, half of whom have secured jobs. It is to be extended to over 25s from 2001.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware of those statistics, but a translation of the details into case histories of people who will genuinely benefit provides a measure of the Government's success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of weeks ago, I visited my job centre in Pontypool and asked to see examples of the success of the new deal—not merely from statistics but from the way in which it had affected people. I give a couple of examples. A 37-year-old man had never worked. His employer's initial reluctance was overcome by the employment service and, for the first time ever, he started work. A 40-year-old woman who wanted to work but could never do so because of learning difficulties is now working in the voluntary sector, again as a direct result of this Government's policies. A talented 22-year-old musician joined the new deal for musicians. He was given expert advice and guidance and his band has been given the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
opportunity to record a compact disc. These are three genuine examples of how the new deal helps people who had never worked but have been given the opportunity to do so. Is not it better for people to be able to go to work when they want to and sustain their dignity? The new deal scheme is wholly responsible for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those themes of enterprise and fairness were not only part of the pre-Budget review, they were carried into the legislative programme in the Queen's Speech. I will not go through the 28 Bills here because that is a matter for another time. However, some affect Wales specifically, as they contain Welsh clauses on which members of the Committee will want to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Government Bill, which the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) mentioned by way of a question, gives councils new powers to promote the well-being of their areas. It will create a strong ethical framework to promote high standards of conduct for councils and officials. It will give councils powers to create strong local partnerships to work together and will streamline councils' management structures with the options of cabinet or mayoral-style systems. What is important for Wales is that the Bill gives flexibility to the National Assembly, so that the Welsh people will have the type of tailored local government that is best for them, whatever the area. We shall be able to define for Wales further types of local authority, executive and ensure that the manner of electing a mayor is based upon a different format, if that is the Assembly's wish. We shall also ensure that a Government amendment will be tabled to enable Wales to use the ombudsman to carry out the functions of the standards board and extend the ombudsman's remit to cover registered social landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time has come for us to examine seriously how local government would operate. I was a member of a local authority for 14 years and I knew that the methods of operating the committee system needed dramatic change. There was also a considerable case for an improvement in scrutiny facilities, so that local authorities could scrutinise the council's work. The Bill provides us with that opportunity, and also allows a special flexibility that will enable us to examine various issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State not accept that scrutiny would be much better if local government in Wales were elected by proportional representation, so that different members of different political parties could place their particular concerns about the administration of local government in Wales under scrutiny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked the wrong man, as I am not too keen on proportional representation. The formal answer is that elections to the Assembly—at least their method and consultation about them—are a matter for the Home Office. At present, I am aware of no plans either in Whitehall or Cardiff to change the method of election. However, there are plans to change the way in which political management of councils is undertaken and I accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
that there is room for change there. I have talked to Flintshire county council and other Welsh authorities about the different methods through which they can balance accountability to the local authority with efficiency and effectiveness. Public scrutiny is important so that the press and the public can examine how our local authorities work. I hope that when the National Assembly engages in detailed study of these matters, it will see that different ways are appropriate in different parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Bills before the House include a Care Standards Bill, which will give the Assembly powers to impose new, higher regulatory standards on care providers and create a care council for Wales, which will regulate the social care work force. That measure builds directly on work already undertaken in the Assembly. In Wales, the regulation of child care will be transferred to the National Assembly, while Estyn will continue to inspect nurseries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there will be a Bill to set up a learning and skills council—formerly a post-16 education Bill—which owes much to what occurred in Wales. My predecessors in the then Welsh Office carefully examined post-16 education and training in Wales through the education, training and advisory group. The Bill provides for the creation of a council for education and training for Wales, and sets out its core duties and powers. It will abolish the Further Education Funding Council for Wales and provide for Estyn to assume responsibility for all provision funded by the CETW.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend talked about greater flexibility in legislation. Will he confirm that he will consider my proposals more seriously? In communities such as those that he and I represent, employment services—revitalised by the new deal—are best equipped to deliver many of the training programmes that are currently delivered by training and enterprise councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I shall seriously consider that during the passage of the Bill and the Assembly will do so to. I know that my hon. Friend takes a great interest in training and has done so for many years. He understands the importance of training, especially to the people of the Welsh valleys. We certainly will examine his proposals and he will be able to raise his points forcefully—in Committee and elsewhere—as the Bill passes through Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made an important point about partnership in my introductory remarks. As I said then, I know from talking to people in Wales that they value politicians working together, whether in the Assembly or in the House. Similarly, we should not forget the partnership between ourselves and Europe, as we are now members of the European Union. I visited Brussels last week and saw how other parts of Europe developed partnerships between their devolved Administrations, their regional governments and their central and federal Governments. Wales is twinned with four motor regions—Lombardy, Rhône-Alpes, Baden-Württemberg and Catalonia. In all those places, it was interesting to see the various ways in which people worked with each other across
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
different Administrations. We can ensure the best for the Welsh people only if we follow that example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Wales and Europe, does the Secretary of State agree that Wales should soon be represented by the UK representative—providing regular representation of the Assembly and reporting back to it.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. As a member of the National Assembly, he knows that it is for the Assembly to consider the details. I visited the Scottish office in Brussels where representatives from the Scottish Executive work with other agencies and private companies in Brussels to the general benefit of Scotland. Indeed, the building there was the face of Scotland in Brussels. We already have an excellent European centre in Brussels. I hope that representatives from the Assembly in Cardiff will work alongside those already in Brussels and alongside the UK representative too. Their diplomatic status will be accredited by the UK representative. The sooner that happens, the better.

This is the last occasion this century when MPs representing Wales will meet together in the House. Our predecessors 100 years ago could well have been legislators on a different planet. Our grandparents faced untold deprivations and hardship: one hundred years ago my grandfather, along with the grandfather of my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Toahig), went underground at 13 while my grandmother sorted coal on the surface. Their children were denied the chance to fulfil their ambitions, to realise their talent or even to dream their dreams. There was plenty of enterprise, but no fairness. We have come a long way since then, but the demands of the next century remain the same. We must harness this new technology. We must become a knowledge economy and we must reward enterprise and skill. However, must never forget that a society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. Those are our twin challenges when we meet again in the next century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) to his new position.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this morning, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) referred to the crisis in agriculture—in other words, the rural crisis. There is nothing in the pre-Budget statement or the Queen's Speech to alleviate any of that. In fact, in a fairly wide-ranging speech the right hon. Gentleman made no reference to anything happening in rural Wales. He referred at length to various places in the valleys and the various projects and investments. We are pleased about those developments, but where do they leave the rest of Wales? Rural areas in the west of Wales have
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
suffered for many years because of underinvestment and because until relatively recently, the Welsh Development Agency had a policy of effectively diverting funds to the east, the south-east and the north-east.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some reference was made to that during oral questions. Would he not agree that the granting of objective 1 status to west Wales and the extension of that status to many parts of west, north and south-west Wales, which no one expected would happen, was the result of a Labour Prime Minister and a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer negotiating a deal in Berlin for rural areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not entirely that. The right hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that others did some work, although the Prime Minister undoubtedly worked out the final details. That may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory at the end of the day if we are talking about underfunding, not matching and a lack of additionality. Hon. Members shake their heads, but it is the crucial point. I will not bang on about it today, but we should look at it because it is the final opportunity for Wales. In seven years' time, there will be enlargement and no further objective 1 funding will come anywhere near Wales and so we need to draw down as much as possible of the available funding. That is why I questioned the right hon. Gentleman about lottery funds in connection with objective 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is far from clear. The Budget and the Welsh Assembly display nothing other than a black hole. Until that black hole is filled, unfortunately we will be unable to deliver to Wales. I want a successful story as much as the Secretary of State does. I want prosperity to increase for west Wales, the valleys and the rest of Wales. I applaud the fact that we have objective 1 status. However, we must work together to ensure that the Treasury matches words with action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does he accept that that stance is detrimental, discouraging people from putting in quality bids that are essential to bringing money back to Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall return to crisis in rural areas. As the Secretary of State acknowledged, nothing in his speech will give joy to people in rural Wales. That is especially true of the Government's automatic credit transfer proposals. In 2003, all benefits will be paid by ACT. According to many who are more informed than I, that may lead to the closure of about 60 per cent. of Welsh post offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The unions reported an evaluation of about 708 post offices. In any event, there is a threat to rural post offices. Last Wednesday, the Prime Minister said that there are problems in rural communities, and the Secretary of State referred to them today. Unfortunately, however, we have not received any suggestion of how they are to be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried, as I am aware of the work done by post offices. We all have rural post offices in our communities. Frankly, if they are to be put at risk, we shall lose an important service provided for our communities. My village of Llanuwchllyn, for example, has one small shop, and the gentleman who runs it tells me that if automated credit transfer goes ahead in 2003, that is the end of the line. The last shop in our village will be gone. We are five or six miles away from the nearest town. Public transport—when available—costs between £2 and £2.50 return. That is a heavy burden to put on a disabled or elderly person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the hon. Gentleman's scaremongering on post offices and his unconstructive attitude towards objective 1. His general theme seems to be the crisis in rural areas, but in my large rural constituency, the latest unemployment total is 1,154. That is the lowest figure for 20 years and has halved in the past two years. Where is the rural crisis, when the Government are creating new jobs through the new deal and the working families tax credit? We are successfully tackling those very problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not therefore have been in contact with any farming unions recently, and certainly not with individual farmers. If he had, he would not say such a thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will reconsider the issue of the payment of benefits and enable our post offices and small shops in Wales to remain as they are. I am not scaremongering; I have met various people who work in the industry and officials from the union representing small post offices, they all agree that there is a huge problem. They are not scaremongering, but dissecting the problem and looking forward. Apparently, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said last week that post offices could always diversify, but what can a small village shop in Llanuwchllyn sell to diversify—sun-dried tomatoes? The whole thing is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely endorse the hon. Gentleman's, comments. About 60 per cent. of the income of those post offices would be lost. There are more than 100 village post offices in my constituency, half of which would have to close as a result of this measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that that is a realistic view; it is not scaremongering. That is what the unions say, and they have examined the position carefully. I urge all hon. Members to reconsider the situation and to lobby on a cross-party basis. It is not a party political issue; we all need to get stuck in and to try to persuade the Government to change their mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a strong point about the need to maintain post offices, but is he saying that people who receive benefits should not have the choice of having the money paid directly into their accounts; that whatever their personal circumstances—whether disabled or not—they should have to go to a post office, rural or otherwise, because we need to maintain post offices; and that those post offices would have to be maintained at the expense of a lack of choice and convenience to benefit recipients?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->

who were grinning will no doubt realise, when their village shops close down, how wrong they were. Their attitude emphasises the fact that the Labour party knows little about rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to rural housing problems. House prices in the United Kingdom are set to boom again, but there is a deplorable lack of social housing in our rural communities. We need to consider that issue. Interestingly, the only reference to rurality in the Queen's Speech was in the Government's proposal to institute a right to roam. Let me make clear my position and that of my party on that: we are in favour of access to the countryside, but we believe that the legislation should be more balanced. We believe that it should be achieved through partnership, so that those who dwell in rural areas can work in partnership with those who seek access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not speak totally without experience in the matter. When I was in private practice as a solicitor, I executed many agreements between those who wished to have access and those who owned farms in the uplands. There is no reason why we should not encourage such agreements. That approach will not be a panacea for farmers, who will not be paid thousands of pounds for nothing, but it can recognise the rights that are being given voluntarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the legislation was announced in Parliament a few months ago, I was vilified because I objected to it. I did so on the grounds that the right to roam as now envisaged is the right for up to 200 people to walk side by side across upland areas—the part of the environment that is most under stress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. I have given way many times this morning. The legislation is a nonsense and it is not thought out. Is it sensible to approve legislation that will devalue a person's property without allowing for some form of compensation? The legislation will be contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998 on that basis alone, if not on others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have grave misgivings about the legislation, not as a result of a wish to exclude people—I want to include people—but because I want to ensure that those who farm and live on the land are also brought into the partnership. The White Paper refers to prosecuting those who do not give access, but there is not a whisper about those who exercise access improperly, which is something else to consider. We need more balanced legislation—something that the majority of people in rural areas can easily buy into and feel comfortable with. Such legislation will, no doubt, increase access to the countryside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before allowing an intervention, I want to add one more thing. I believe that some form of fund should be available to local authorities to maintain existing footpaths.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, as he has done so many times already. I entirely agree with his last point; there should be a fund on which local authorities can draw, because they are having trouble enforcing rights of access. However, to return to the hon. Gentleman's original point, I understood that the voluntary approach had been tried and had failed miserably. That is why we are now codifying the law so that rights and responsibilities are properly laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From my experience, it has worked well in the areas in which it has worked—although that sounds somewhat odd. It did not work everywhere in Wales because it was not tried everywhere. It worked perfectly well in several homesteads in the Bevouins and the Aran mountains. It also worked well in Snowdonia and on Snowdon itself. There is no reason why the whole matter should not be left to the National Assembly to consider. The Tir Cymen scheme, which ran in the Meirionnydd area, included access, and that worked perfectly well. Access could also be included in the Tir Gofal scheme. So there are ways of achieving the same result without introducing a draconian right to roam, which will undermine rural communities even more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During what many may regard as a sustained and ill-founded whinge, the hon. Gentleman pontificated on the Human Rights Act 1998. Of course, as a practising member of the Bar, he has every right to do that, but does he share my view that there are many misgivings in Wales about Plaid Cymru's policy on second homes? The hon. Gentleman mentioned compensation, but the rights under the Act apply equally to what many people regard as an ill-founded policy on the sensitive issue of the right to sell second homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a limit on the number of holiday homes in any area, including in sensitive areas. That approach would be sensible, and local government could administer it. Once a percentage had been reached, planning permission would be required; permission would not be granted beyond a certain percentage. No one would be affected because the proposal would not appreciably affect land values and certainly would not affect individuals. [

We have heard slurs about my party's view of objective 1 funding. We have always tried to advance the agenda; we shall have to continue to do that. I hope that all political parties will be able to work together on the issue. The Select Committee is considering it on an all-party basis. There are problems with ensuring matched funding and true
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
additionality; but I need not talk about that. We must all push forward the agenda. I am not trying to put anybody off applying for the funding—it would be good to apply. That is why my party has written to all local authorities, asking and encouraging them to proceed. We, and many Labour Members, have met many people from the voluntary sector and from small companies. We have all rightly been doing our bit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange to try to close the debate by saying, "This is negative." The Secretary of State's arm would be strengthened if a voice from Wales told the Treasury to cough up. That approach would be constructive; there would be a pyrrhic victory otherwise. I do not wish the debate to become negative or to be undermined—that is not my intention. The issue is important and has already been aired so I do not propose to consider it at length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Transport Bill includes some good measures. Parking levies should apply not only to workplaces but to out-of-town shopping centres, which generate more traffic, destroy town-centre shops and create more social exclusion than any other form of retail outlet. Will the Government consider such levies? In opposition, they were in favour of such a measure but now, unfortunately, they are not. When and why did the change occur? It might have something to do with the sponsorship of political events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strategic Rail Authority seems to have little accountability to Wales. The Secretary of State says that one member will be appointed, but one member will not do justice to an entire integrated rail transport system in Wales. I hope that he or she might do so, but that would be a tall order. Wales should have been accorded at least the same powers as those given to the Scottish Parliament. That will inevitably have to happen if the job is to be done properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerns have been expressed about the privatisation of air traffic control. That move is strange given Labour's detailed explanations in opposition about why it should not happen. Free bus passes for pensioners is an excellent idea. I am pleased that it is to be introduced in Wales and that the National Assembly is showing a lead.

We ought to consider the interesting question of home zones, proposed under clause 93 of the Local Government Bill. However, I should not deal with the Bill at length. Much of it is welcome, but more regard should have been paid to accountability in Wales.

The Secretary of State referred to the Local Government Bill and to the question of directly elected mayors. I have a problem with the issue. The system would appear to be presidential—[

On the cabinet structure of local government, the Secretary of State might tell me that it is possible to buy in or out of the scheme; I am aware of that. Indeed, one Plaid Cymru-controlled council has a cabinet structure. What worries me is that only those people who are in the cabinets will know what is going on. I agree that it is essential for decisions to made sooner. The three-month cycle is too long and cumbersome for the decisions that are made regularly by local government. However, if those in the cabinet structure are running their affairs relatively quickly and those on the back benches are not fully informed, there is a recipe for disaster. I have grave misgivings about the system, but I realise that there will be plenty of opportunity to debate the Local Government Bill and the new system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am disappointed with the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement. There is nothing to assist rural areas of Wales or its agriculture. We read today about the bogus £50 million that was paid by the Government to bail out agriculture, of which only £1 million was new money.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate is welcome. Despite the fact that the National Assembly plays an important part in Welsh life, Westminster Members of Parliament have the important role of examining the Budget and the legislation that will have an impact on people in Wales. One of the incredible things about the pre-Budget statement was the Chancellor's resolve to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
continue a policy to achieve economic expansion and, on that basis, to improve public services by an increase in public spending in line with that expansion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to consider that approach in relation to the health service. I am not asking for a total revamping of the Barnett formula, but we must deal with the fact that Wales clearly has massive health problems, which are far greater than those of England. They are catalogued in the excellent stock-take document provided by the National Assembly and they have been catalogued in past debates and elsewhere. Hospital admissions in Wales are 18 per cent. higher than those of England and the activity of accident and emergency units is 17 per cent. higher. More than 20 per cent. more prescriptions are issued in Wales and 19 per cent. more visits are made to GPs' surgeries. A 28 per cent. greater proportion of people in Wales report long-term health problems. The mortality rate, both adjusted and unadjusted, is higher in Wales. More cancer registrations are made than in England—they are 19 per cent. higher among men and 14 per cent. higher among women—and 19 per cent. more deaths per 1,000 people are caused by heart disease. It is depressing to look at all of those problems, although I believe that the National Assembly has made a good start. Jane Hutt, the Assembly Secretary for Health and Social Services, ensured that the stock-take document was put together. Problems and past difficulties are acknowledged and suggestions have been made on how they may be solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider the difference between England and Wales and its impact on the funding of the health service in Wales. I should also mention some of the pluses, to lift the depression away. In the first quarter of 1999, 13,000 more cases were treated in Wales than in the same quarter of the previous year. A big increase in day-case surgery has also occurred, from 57 per cent. in 1995 to 69 per cent. in 1999. The average length of stay in hospital has been reduced over the years and life expectancy is up by five years from its level in the 1970s. It is not all doom and gloom, but we must recognise the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Calculations of the Welsh bloc mean that we get a share of the percentage increase in spending for health services in England. In Wales, however, we spend about 13 per cent. more per capita on health than is spent in England. We are getting a lower per capita increase than that on which we project our spending. A movement of money across budgets in Wales is therefore required if we are to keep up with the increase that we need. When I was a Minister, the matter troubled me very much. Just before my departure from office, I was considering how to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of health services in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, and during the past six months, the process has been a labour of love. I have been considering a series of indicators throughout the health service in Wales during 1996–97 and, to some extent, during 1997–98, although not as much information on those years is available. I have been looking at trust accounts, financial targets, administrative charges, overhead costs and activities
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
and costs relating to the 50 most common treatments for in-patients and day cases in Wales. The information is included in the Audit Commission performance profile for 18 of the old trusts, as they existed in Wales in 1996–97, and the Welsh Office's own NHS statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work was very much a labour of love. I was much aided in the number crunching involved. Imagine considering 17 acute hospitals and 100 treatments for hospital day cases in each hospital and calculating what each hospital claimed to have spent to provide that service. I looked at the average cost, and the average cost of the best three. After evaluation of the potential best savings there, I concluded that of the 50 in-patient treatments, 25 were to be found in all Welsh hospital trusts. Of day cases, only 14 were to be found in all the trusts. After calculating the saving from each hospital reaching the average, or the average of the best three, of each treatment—a highly complex amount of work, and I pay tribute to my researcher Kathryn Drinkall for operating all that—I concluded that there was potential for savings of between £30 million and £100 million. That was merely on treatments in common; it excluded all those that were not. I recognise that there may be good reasons for those differences, but the range was startling. With eight of the 25 treatments, the differences between the worst and the best was more than double.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is gratifying to know why my hon. Friend asked so many questions during the previous Session. Finally, I know that the answers were put to good use. Did my hon. Friend or his researcher look into whether any of the hospitals attained apparent high efficiencies in some treatments because they were doing so at the expense of others, or discover that some costs were pushed into some areas but not others? In other words, was it truly possible to attain an overall efficiency target for an individual hospital across the whole range without affecting other treatments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the huge problems. I spoke to an official at the NHS information executive agency about them and we discussed the difficulties at length. This is why when making my calculations about potential savings and observations about the efficiency of trusts I looked at other factors, such as the administration and overhead costs and bed occupancy rates, and tried to reach a conclusion. I will not name the trusts because they have all been subsumed into new trusts, but I discovered that of the 24—I did not look at the ambulance trust or the dental hospital in any detail—seven could be included as excellent or good. Seven looked good, although I was not happy with some of the data, which did not quite indicate that everything was as it should be. Four looked as though they could be good but, again, I was not happy with some of their data, and six had serious challenges, because almost all of the data suggested problems. It was also interesting to note that the trusts with problems tended to be in health authority areas with problems: Bro Taff and Dyfed Powys were areas where trusts had difficulties.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

With the £3,200 million of savings that I identified, it is not a matter of telling a trust that it can improve output by another 2 or 3 per cent. with the money that it already has. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. There are ways to utilise the savings that are identified, but that will require NHS trusts, managers and clinicians in Wales to work together on strategic plans. Unfortunately, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) virtually destroyed any concept of strategic planning in the health service in Wales during his reign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I compliment the hon. Gentleman on his excellent research on this issue. Given that we are approaching the new millennium, have the trusts that the hon. Gentleman believes are not up to scratch done sufficient preparation in looking for the millennium bug? Will patients who go to those trusts be in greater danger because, even though sufficient resources have been made available, they are not being used to the best effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not followed the millennium bug issue as closely as I did in 1997–98. However, at that time, I gave a specific commitment that no trust in Wales would fail to be up to scratch by 1 January 2000. I have read nothing in the press to suggest that that will not be the case. I am confident in that commitment, although my head has already rolled so I do not need to worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the Budget and to spending, we must put it to the Chancellor that there is a powerful case for the health service in Wales to invest to save. The savings that I identified as a target could raise activity in Welsh hospitals by between 2 and 5 per cent. I shall have to do a little more work on the issue, but those savings could more or less wipe out waiting lists. However, there needs to be some initial investment. Once we identify the hospitals that are doing the best job, investment will be needed to cut their costs. Although the idea of spend and save and of getting the Chancellor to give us more money than is allocated under the Barnett formula is my own, the National Assembly's stock-take document has already grasped the problems and is working towards dealing with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to make a strong case as regards efficient hospitals. Close to 60 per cent. of hospitals are more than up to the challenge, slightly fewer than 20 per cent. need a bit of help and a lot of work has to be done in about a quarter. Under the programme that I have described, we must persuade the Chancellor that great benefit is to be gained from the efficient delivery of services. We can provide better services and get better health and more value for our money from the health service by simply examining the indicators. I must admit that I had only begun to do so when I was a Minister, although I cannot deny that we did a lot of good things. There is so much potential that I hope that that message can be taken back to the Chancellor and that we shall see huge improvements in the next five to 10 years in the health of people in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Bible, when God became unhappy about things, he sent a great flood to wash away the evil. It is more than just coincidence that the current deluge in Montgomeryshire started just after the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Secretary of State for Wales to be a Nemesis or a Noah in the affairs of Wales? I suggest that he can be a Noah by allowing us to enter the great ark of partnership that he was talking about—two by two with the Liberal Democrats—and to start working together to stop the deluge of cuts, which have caused all but the most hardy to despair in the public sector. Taking his concept of partnership on board, if he wants the public to play ball, it is important that the Government play as well. The only thing that we need to make that partnership effective are the resources to fulfil many of the high ideals that I can safely say that all of us in this Room want for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech was a mixed bag for Wales. We agree that, on the face of it, the care leavers Bill and the Children (Leaving Care) Bill are good ideas, so long as there are resources in Wales to make them reality. Some of the more general Bills, such as the Freedom of Information Bill, could have a positive effect in Wales, bearing in mind that we are attempting to set up a new model of open government. Of course, Liberal Democrat Members have concerns about some of the details, but I will not go into that now. Strategically, we must agree that it is a step in the right direction for Wales for such Bills to be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) summed it up: many people in Wales do not sense a great improvement in the past three years or a radical step change in comparison with the previous Government. In many ways, they feel forgotten. They hear the words on television, but they see no difference in the rural environment. There is unquestionably an enormous crisis there, to which I shall come in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise to the Secretary of State that depopulation is one of the key issues in rural areas. People are leaving rural Wales to seek their fortunes elsewhere, not least because they are encouraged by their families to do so. That is damaging the cultural infrastructure in much of Wales, which is a tragedy. Wales is a wonderful place in which to bring up children and settle as a relatively young family. I fear that if that tendency reaches a critical momentum, it could be unstoppable. We could see whole tracts of Wales being filled with retirement homes, with little for young people to do. There would be a corresponding increase in social provision needs. There has already been a disproportionately high increase in the average age in areas such as mid Wales. I suspect that that is symptomatic of a difficult issue which, if we do not tackle it now, will come back and bite us in the century ahead. In that context, there are serious problems with a number of items in the Queen's Speech.

We have heard comments on the Transport Bill and I do not intend to repeat them. It is, however, worth bearing in mind that people in mid Wales and other parts of Wales feel that there has been precious little improvement in transport in the past few years. Many of us hoped that there would be a radical step change after 18 years of neglect by the previous Government, but that has not yet happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that there has been a dramatic improvement in transport in the past two years, not least the movement of passengers on to the railway, where numbers have increased by 14 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth bearing in mind that passenger complaints on the railways are at an all-time high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might also be fair to point out that there has been a 25 per cent. increase in passengers in the past three years. That is a spectacular shift on to rail. Only the private sector can raise the funds necessary to put in place the investment to cope with further growth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need not rehearse again public and private ownership of the railways. Suffice it to say—I put this on record once again—that one of the stupidest things that the former Government ever did was to cut into pieces what could have been a superb United Kingdom-wide rail network. Not many members of the public would agree with the sentiments of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the huge amounts of money promised by the Deputy Prime Minister, who has cited a figure of £80 billion, we are once again seeing window dressing involving double counting and no real new investment. I have not listened to the details of his proposals, but I imagine that all hon. Members would agree with the sentiment of wanting a good public transport system, especially for Wales. However, the development of such a system will take new money rather than the mere repackaging of money that is already available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are few grounds for optimism in rural areas improvement in public transport. I remind the Minister that to make it harder for people in such areas to use private transport—usually cars—without giving them a reasonable alternative is effectively a tax on living in the countryside. That is not a healthy state of affairs; it is unhealthy to encourage people who may not have high incomes to migrate or not to travel. Sadly, the approach could add to the depopulation problem that I described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman therefore welcome the Chancellor's announcement of the abolition of the fuel duty escalator, in response to sustained lobbying from the large number of Labour Members who represent rural constituencies such as my own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In truth, the hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The Liberal Democrats have been seeking to reassess the policy, just as the Government have been, largely on account of the type of pressures that he describes. He is right: there has been a healthy pressure on the Government from the ranks of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Labour party to reassess the tax, which appears to give yet more punishment to people who depend on private transport while, in the cities, the people who can find alternatives are getting away lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many of the hon. Members present will know, I am concerned about air transport in Wales. I am especially concerned that the potential sell-off of the National Air Traffic Services is unhealthy. Control of our air lanes should remain in public hands, although now is not the time to go into any detail on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the social security elements of the Queen's speech, it is clear to all hon. Members who hold surgeries that the Child Support Agency needs to be scrapped rather than merely reformed. Liberal Democrats propose to replace it with a new system of family courts. It has lost the faith of the public. I visited its headquarters for my area, which are located in Birkenhead. I am convinced that the people there are doing the best that they can to deliver a high-quality service. I was amazed at their commitment to their clients. The difficulty is that they are implementing an almost unworkable policy, which unfortunately tends to harm the people who need such harm the least and the people who are most willing to pay, while letting many other people go scot free. For the sake of Welsh constituents, I should like a more concerted effort to have been made to replace the CSA with a more equitable system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The countryside Bill has been mentioned. It will have a big impact on rural areas. The Liberal Democrats share with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy a concern that a blanket right to roam will lead to enormous damage and erosion. It is worth remembering that, for farmers, their fields are a factory and are important not merely for visitors to the countryside but for feeding the nation. They must also remain as viable as possible. A blanket right could be hugely damaging and, although we agree with the idea of an equitable solution, we do not believe that it should necessarily take effect through legal enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sites of special scientific interest and better protection for wildlife are a little more complicated in Wales than they may seem at first sight. For example, SSSIs are located on the Montgomeryshire canal, which many people are trying to reopen. Ironically, the SSSIs get in the way of reopening large parts of the canal for public use. Such matters must be handled with sensitivity. We may agree that organic farming is important to making farming viable in the future, especially for small farms, but there is no money in it at present. There is little in the Queen's Speech to give me confidence that organic farming is a strategic priority for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the contents of the crime Bill were relevant to Wales—the reform of the probation service, for example—but money is needed to make those reforms effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I re-emphasise a point made earlier about the Bill on the Post Office: small post offices are more than just a resource; they are the heart of many small villages and communities. To implement the changes proposed in the Queen's Speech would have a devastating
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman the courage to answer the question that I asked the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strategically, it makes sense to have the most streamlined system that is workable, but we must remember the client. Many of the clients of such services would not want to be paid in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are violently agreeing! We do not oppose streamlining the system, but we are concerned. I make a differentiation. I do not take issue with what the hon. Gentleman says; our concern is to recognise the strategic importance of the Post Office. Therefore, if systems are introduced that result in post offices being used less, we should ensure that village post offices receive sufficient support to enable them to remain viable, for all kinds of social and economic reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is being confronted with an argument about choice that is far too simplistic. If there are disabled people in the community—I am president of a club for disabled people, which has 650 members—there is no reason why their benefits should not be paid directly. The point that my hon. Friend was making is that rural post offices are a vital part of the rural infrastructure. They form part of the social fabric; the matter is not as simplistic as some hon. Members say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the nods and support from those on the Government Benches, I venture to say that most members of the Committee agree that post offices are important. We probably disagree about the degree of support that is necessary to maintain small post offices as viable options. That is why the Government must consult and listen to what those communities have to say on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we agree that post offices are important, especially in the countryside. There has been a campaign concerning public payments to ensure that they remain open. Has there been a campaign in the hon. Gentleman's constituency to ensure that council tax and public-private utility charges are paid in post offices? Does he support such action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to answer the point about post offices. In essence, I agree with the importance of making a post office as accessible and flexible as possible. There is nothing in principle to stop the sort of things that the hon. Gentleman describes, but crucial to customer service is client choice. It is crucial to maintain those post offices even if there is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
significant swing away from the present way of doing things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is most generous in giving way for a second time. I am grateful to him for giving me some sort of answer, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy did not. The importance of post offices, especially rural post offices, is widely acknowledged, but we must consider the future use of post offices rather than set in aspic a service that may no longer be appropriate or efficient. We need to look at the use that post offices could make of new services. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has agreed to meet a delegation of post office workers from my constituency to discuss the matter. We are concerned that there should be a future for the Post Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, want to involve the post offices. However, my last comment on the subject is that, although we can agree on their future direction in service delivery, it is important to ensure that we know how we intend to support the Post Office before we take away a significant element of its income. The hon. Gentleman said that the Secretary of State has agreed to meet a delegation from the Post Office. I hope that the Secretary of State will also consider meeting me to discuss the matter, which would mean that I could look forward to three meetings with the Secretary of State.

The pre-Budget report contains some proposals that we welcome. The working families tax credit is a sensible idea and an excellent step forward, and we applaud the Government for introducing it. We also thank the Government for stealing our proposal on free television licences for the over-75s. We bear no grudge; it is our Christmas present to the Government. Perhaps, more surprisingly, my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and I want to lend our support to the new deal. I recognise that our party has been somewhat critical at times, but I have seen the new deal at close hand and I believe that it gives people a real opportunity. Perhaps I am outspoken in saying so, but I respect what the Government are trying to do and hope that, in time, we can find ways of improving the new deal—perhaps in the way that new deal support subsidies are paid—to make it even more effective.

On the subject of free bus passes, we congratulate the Government on taking on another Liberal Democrat policy. Other elements of the Budget are not so promising, but many of them have been mentioned already, so I shall not repeat the arguments.

I emphasise the statistic mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire: many farmers are working for 37p an hour. Some farmers are making such a loss that they are living on cash flow and the generosity of their capital, which cannot go on for ever. To many in the countryside, the pre-Budget statement seems to continue an austerity programme that has not been matched since the second world war and which is effectively causing a

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
recession in many parts of Wales. Whatever fine words the pre-Budget report might contain, Wales is suffering in terms of health, education and social provision. It will continue to suffer until substantial extra funds are made available. That does not mean counting the money in clever ways; it means real extra money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On health, it is cuts, cuts, cuts. There is a feeling that the health service endlessly has to manage cuts in the same way that it had to under the previous Government. I have no doubts about the quality of staff in the health service. Obviously, following my near-fatal accident last year, I benefited from the superb quality of health provision. Again and again, we see health authority bosses on the ropes, trying to find money when there are no more cuts to be made—without cutting services. As we know, waiting lists are extremely high. Experts in the health service know how to do the job, but they are not given the money with which to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lloyd George said that one can judge the quality of a nation by how it treats its elderly. It is not a good time for respite and long-term residential care. Although the Government made noises on that, the money did not follow. The 73p a week increase in pensions could have ben handled differently. Much more could have been done to help pensioners although, in fairness, the winter fuel payment is welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for education, class size continues to increase for the over-sevens. Despite fine words, money has not backed up the promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Points have been made on objective 1 and 2 matched funding which, for the sake of brevity, I shall not repeat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standstill budgets greatly worry people in the arts. The Arts Council made the extraordinary decision to cut funding to several theatres, including Powys theatre. It has created competition between theatres that have to fight for franchises. That is no way to run the arts policy in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a crisis in council expenditure. The proposed increase of £71 per council tax payer in Powys is deeply resented. Although it is right to support councils that need more money, especially in south Wales, it is wrong to expect councils in other parts of Wales that are little better off to pay for it. The money should come from the Government. That increase is being debated in Powys. If the Government want to create a positive impression and take the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
pressure off local authorities to make cuts they need to make substantial investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary asked for a figure. Let us be ambitious for Wales, which does not mean playing party politics with budgets and creating a £12 billion war chest for the next general election. Some £650 million to £700 million from the war chest would bring to fruition our ideas for Wales. We could easily match objective 1 and 2 funding. Real increases could be made in education, health and social provision. If the money is managed carefully and not provided as one big splurge, we could create a sustained improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the Welsh National Assembly elections, the Liberal Democrats produced a wish list for Wales that had 220 priorities. Will that £650 million fulfil all those priorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the 220 priorities were to be self-funded by the block grant. Surprising as it may seem, the Government—I hate to point this out because I wanted to be magnanimous in our gifts—have taken on some of our funding ideas, such as putting a few pence on a pack of fags that goes straight into health care and the provision of free eye tests. The Government scoff a little, but they are scoffing at their wise Chancellor who is revisiting the Liberal Democrat manifesto. None of those commitments was made in the Labour manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of being even-handed, the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement contain some good policies for Wales, but it is a mixed bag. Despite the words of partnership, a great deal of party politics is being played. Instead of relying on a war chest, the Government would get more votes by spreading the money evenly across the years. We would have taken that responsible and sensible approach. They, however, made the political judgment not to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Measures that cost nothing could be introduced, such as proportional representation for local government which, interestingly, was supported by the Secretary of State in his former role as Minister of State in the Northern Ireland Office. He may not think that it is appropriate for Wales. Perhaps we can bring in George Mitchell, who did so well in Northern Ireland, to sort out Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of Wales in Europe is on the horizon. It would be superb if the pound were more stable, as that would greatly ease the export problems experienced by agriculture, especially small farmers, and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not here to condemn the Government outright. We want to play a constructive role. We will continue our co-operative experiment of giving praise where praise is due and providing policies where there are none. I ask the Secretary of State to be true to his word about partnership. In our judgment, the message from the experts in education, health, social services and agriculture is, "Give us the tools and we'll finish the job". If he does that, he can not only stop the deluge of cuts in Wales, but start the next millennium a hero.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was especially disappointed by the comments of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I tried to intervene but did not manage it, so I should like to respond to him now. I take it that he was speaking on behalf of his party. Plaid Cymru calls itself the party of Wales, but the hon. Gentleman's speech concentrated on the plight of rural areas. We agree that we need to pay attention to the problems of rural areas, but if Plaid Cymru honestly calls itself the party of Wales, I would expect to hear a little more about the problems of the whole of Wales, not just part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard much doom and gloom about rural Wales. Why did the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy not mention the winter fuel payments, which affect pensioners, free eye tests, which affect pensioners, or reduced value added tax on fuel, which affects everyone in both rural and urban areas? There were certain omissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to highlight one point in particular. In the hon. Gentleman's constituency, there are nearly 10,000 pensioners, of whom nearly 4,000 are over 75. They are all affected by the three policies to which I referred, which were introduced by the Labour Government and mentioned in the Chancellor's pre-Budget speech. Does the hon. Gentleman not care about those pensioners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If I had managed to intervene on the hon. Gentleman, I would also have given the new deal figures for his constituency.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->

Secondly, I unreservedly welcome the provisions for pensioners and I do not need the hon. Lady to remind me of the plight of my pensioners. I was in the House for some time before the hon. Lady joined and I have hosted many an event for pensioners, so I will take no lessons from her on that.

I welcome the Local Government Bill and endorse the final report of the advisory group on openness in the public sector. I also welcome my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's words about the importance of local authorities being adequately scrutinised. The Bill calls on local authorities to work on developing a

culture of openness in those activities. Throughout Wales, local authorities are major employers—in many constituencies, they are the largest employer. They also handle vast amounts of public money.

A recent district auditor's report notes that Gwynedd council spent about £120 million net on the provision of services. It also spent some £30 million on capital schemes in 1998–99. Gwynedd is now in an objective 1 area, which means that, from next year, the maximum level of European funding will be available to benefit the people of the county. Conwy county borough council will also benefit from that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents are about to experience in a most tangible way the benefits of a Labour Government. They will, however, wish to be assured that public money will be spent wisely, fairly and, above all, openly and honestly. If I may, I should like to quote from the district auditor's report, to which I have just referred. It said that Gwynedd council
	<br><blockquote><p>"must now ensure it has adequate arrangements in place to ensure that value for money is obtained from this investment and the highest standards of probity are maintained."</p></blockquote>
Members of the Committee may ask why it was necessary for the district auditor to make such a comment. In its 1997–98 management letter to Gwynedd council, the district auditor reported:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our audit found a number of weaknesses in the Council's arrangements for administering grants".</p></blockquote>
The report continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have recommended to officers that where members or officers of the Council are involved in grant applications, the Council should seek to ensure greater transparency in dealing with such applications".</p></blockquote>
That was a clear warning to the council that it needed to reform its ways. Unfortunately, as the district auditor's November report made clear, it failed to do so. Criticisms of the council's practice—too many for me to recount—appear line by line in the report. However, it must be recorded that the chief criticism relates to the failure of Gwynedd's Plaid Cymru councillors to declare their interests. We are not talking about inexperienced Plaid Cymru councillors—one is the leader of the council. The councillors' response has so far been disappointing. They seek to justify their failure as "mere technical errors." From many discussions with my constituents, I know that the public see the situation differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Government and Opposition Members will welcome the report of the advisory group on openness in the public sector. I have urged Conwy and Gwynedd councils—my constituency is covered by both—to move immediately to create a culture of greater openness. Public authorities will have to do that once Labour's Freedom of Information Bill, which the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) mentioned, becomes law. The final report of the advisory group recommends that local authorities act immediately, the Home Office supports that suggestion. I have written to the chief executives of both authorities to ask how they intend to proceed and I expect to hear from them shortly. I have also asked to be kept informed as they develop their proposals.

The legislation will reinforce the measures in the Local Government Bill, which was published last week. One of its purposes is the combating of local sleaze by the establishment of a new tough ethical framework for councillors and council officers and I look forward to receiving more information about an independent enforcement body for Wales. Bearing in mind what has happened in the past few weeks over the publication of reports, such a body is long overdue. It is needed if Wales is to be governed fairly and openly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to deal with two matters relating to the legislative programme in the Queen's Speech: transport and the appointment of a children's commissioner for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 28 Bills are an important package, demonstrating that the Government are fulfilling their electoral promises and long-standing pledges. Among the Bills we have introduced are measures relating to freedom of information and the right to roam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by tackling transport and transport legislation, which has already been covered in part this morning. However, the matter is important to my constituency, so I shall refer to some of the Bill's proposals. My constituency—Cardiff, North—contains people who commute to the centre of the town. However, commuters also travel through it from the valleys and the M4. Communities that used to be small villages at the edge of Cardiff, such as Whitchurch, Rhiwbina and Llanmishen—have now become part of the big city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a constituency that is almost completely urban, and I know that that is different from the position of many Committee members who have spoken today. Some areas that used to be small villages now feel that they have been taken over by the car, and there are many worries about them losing their identity. In those small communities, shops are closing and commuter traffic is spoiling the atmosphere. Nowhere is it more necessary to have an integrated transport system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that one way of solving that problem is by encouraging people to work at home using modern electronic systems? Teleworking could revitalise communities that are currently dormitory towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Developments such as home working through advanced technology are to be welcomed. Work and home being near to one another—even if not in the same place—leads to a more integrated way of life and is to be warmly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valleys railway lines run through my constituency and are popular and well used. There are many park-and-ride schemes, which are especially well used between 8 and 9 am and in the evening rush hour. However, there is a capacity problem on railways in my constituency, affecting people who want to get on trains. We are shifting people on to trains; indeed, we have already heard about the big
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
increase in the number of rail users. Unfortunately, there are not enough carriages on the valleys lines to take those people. Therefore, in Llandaff North in my constituency, people are often left at the station. They cannot get on the trains because of insufficient capacity. The trains are frequent, but they are not big enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cardiff, North, the roads are crammed with cars going into the city centre, the railways are overfull and people are left on platforms. There are also big secondary schools in the area, such as Ysgol Glanta. Some people from that school are in the Committee Room today, and I am sure that a contribution could be made to solving the problems that occur at home time in Ysgol Glanta.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of railways, which pass through her constituency and into mine, will she say whether she agrees that the problem with the Valley Lines is that the private company's contract gives it the incentive to run each train for the maximum profit, but not to invest in new rolling track so that more people can use the line in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. What we really need is investment in the Valley Lines and in that area. More people want to get on trains than can do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend, but before she moves off the point about the undercapacity, is not the other side of the coin the dangerous overcrowding on some of our commuter trains? That is in an issue in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I travelled on some of the Valley Lines trains at peak hours to see what it was like and found them very overcrowded and unpleasant. That represents a huge area where we can develop the use of the train, particularly on lines such as the Valley Lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning now to the proposals in the Queen's Speech and in the Transport Bill, I am delighted that a Strategic Rail Authority has been proposed. That is an important move forward. It has the purpose of promoting the use of the rail network and it should assist the development of an integrated transport system not only for passengers but for goods. The SRA should have a strong impact in Wales. The National Assembly has a duty to develop an integrated transport system, so we must ensure that it works closely with the SRA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Strategic Rail Authority could help to integrate the channel tunnel link so that we could have services into Wales? Does she share my astonishment when she sees the rows of Eurostar trains in the depot outside Paddington that seem to be going nowhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend's apposite comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome my right hon. Friend's confirmation that there will be Welsh representation on the Strategic Rail Authority. We must ensure that the representation is effective and forceful. I understand
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
that there will be between eight and 15 members on the SRA. Could we have more than one representative on the SRA, as it is quite difficult having one representative from one area? People sometimes need to work together on issues and to cover for absences and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make the SRA really effective in Wales, we should consider having physical representation in the form of an office, or some part of it, based in Cardiff. It is important to get this integrated transport system right. We need a mechanism to get the SRA, the Assembly and the local authorities, which will have much more to do with the buses, to work together. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would tell us some of his thoughts on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the head of the SRA, Sir Alastair Morton, said yesterday that Wales might have its own national rail network. We know that the four regional franchises in Wales may be linked together. In Scotland, ScotRail has 95 per cent. of the franchise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
