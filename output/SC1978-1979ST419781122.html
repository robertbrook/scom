	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Legal Advice and Assistance (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) (No. 2) Regulations 1978.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start, I would intimate that I think that it will be for the convenience of the Committee if we take at the same time the following regulations also set down for consideration:

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>The Legal Aid (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) Regulations 1978.</li>

	<li>The Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) Regulations 1978.</li>

	<li>The Legal Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (No. 2) Regulations 1978.</li>
</div> <!-- ul -->
The Question on all these regulations will be put at 12 o'clock at the latest, if no hon. Member has any objection to that procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These regulations, as the Committee will know, increase the financial limits for legal aid in civil proceedings and for legal advice and assistance in civil and criminal matters. As you indicated, Mr. Doig, I shall introduce all of them together. As a formality, I have moved the motion relating to the first set of Scottish regulations, but the Committee will note that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is here, and he will deal with any Scottish matters arising. I am sure that it would not be overwelcomed were I to pretend a knowledge of Scottish law which I clearly do not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should object to the hon. and learned Gentleman assuming that he had any knowledge of English law, so that applies both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
As the Committee will know, in recent years the financial limits for legal aid and for legal advice and assistance have been increased annually in line with increases in supplementary benefits. In that way, the limits have kept pace with the rate of inflation. I have presented such regulations in Committee, as has my right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General, and we have claimed no more for the regulations than that worthy but limited objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations before us today continue that practice, but I am glad to be able to say that this year they are simply a holding operation. Last year in the debate on similar regulations, at which, I know, many of my hon. Friends and one or two hon. Members opposite here this morning were also present, I concluded by saying—in a hardly memorable or elegent phrase, but I used it none the less—that I hoped one day it would be possible to announce that I would call dramatic increases in legal aid limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I cannot yet totally fulfil my hopes, I can look forward today, I think, to fulfilling them, and I hope to give what I might call, in a better phrase, a useful prologue to fulfilling those aspirations. My noble Friends intends, as he indicated in another place, to make further regulations in the early part of next year which will make significant and urgently needed improvements to the financial conditions for legal aid, advice and assistance, with the objective of bringing a far larger proportion of the population within the civil legal aid scheme. I know that that is desired by every member of the Committee. It is common ground that we wish to remedy the deficiency to which hon. Member after hon. Member has referred in every debate that we have had on the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to deal with the regulations before the Committee. The legal aid regulations raise the lower income limit— that is, the limit below which a contribution from the litigant is not payable— from £760 to £815 a year and the upper limit—that is, the limit above which legal aid is not available—from £2,400 to £2,600 a year. Both limits, of course, relate to a person's disposable income. This figure, which has some bearing on my noble Friend's package to which I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
shall refer later is arrived at after allowances have been made for dependants and deductions made for necessary expenses, such as income tax, rent, rates and any other reasonable commitments of the applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also increase the lower capital limit—that is, the limit for which no contribution is payable from capital—from £340 to £365, and the upper capital limit—that is, the limit above which legal aid is not normally available—from £1,600 to £1,700.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend has also made other legal aid regulations, which are not subject to affirmative resolution and which come into force at the same time as these regulations, increasing the allowances for dependants in the assessment of disposable capital. That will mean that the upper capital limit of £1,700 will be further increased to £2,080 for a married person with two children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal advice and assistance regulations that we are discussing make corresponding changes for legal advice and assistance, commonly known as the green form scheme. The upper disposable income limit for legal advice and assistance is increased from £48 to £52 a week and the disposable capital limit is increased from £340 to £365.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend has also made two other sets of legal advice and assistance regulations, which again are not subject to affirmative resolution and which come into force at the same time. Those regulations raise the lower disposable income limit for advice and assistance, below which that advice and assistance is free, from £23 to £25 a week. Consequential amendments to the scale of contributions for legal advice and assistance are made and increased allowances for dependants are prescribed for assessing disposable capital. The new capital allowances means that a married person with two children will be able to obtain advice and assisance if his disposable capital is less than £745.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I indicated earlier, the regulations are no more than an interim arrangement. They make modest increases, and I claim no more for them than that. My noble Friend felt that the practice of annual uprating should continue even though he is in the process of preparing a package
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
of significant improvements to the financial conditions for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For reasons that I shall briefly explain, it is not possible—much as I should like it to be—to give precise details of my noble Friend's proposal at this stage. However, I can help the Committee, as I have a duty to do, by giving a broad outline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The improvements that my noble Friend has in mind will gradually increase to a maximum of about £6 million a year. That is within the public expenditure plans announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 9th November. At this stage, it might be useful if I were to set the proposed improvements that my noble Friend has in mind in the context of the civil legal aid scheme as it is today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my noble Friend said in another place, despite the very low limits that have been imposed on the scheme by years and years of financial stringency, the scheme is, and has been, of immense value to a large number of people who without it would not have been able to enforce or defend their legal rights before the courts. I am sure that all hon. Members who have criticised the low number of people who have benefited will agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite this financial stringency, the cost of civil legal aid has risen from £26 million in 1975–76 to about £38 million in 1977–78. To get a full picture of the full scope of legal aid one must add to that the cost of criminal legal aid in magistrates' courts, which, incidentally, also falls upon my noble Friend's Vote. This has risen from £14 million in 1975–76 to around £20 million in 1977–78.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are these figures for the United Kingdom or do they relate only to England and Wales? If they relate only to the latter, can he give the figures for Scotland, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They relate to England and Wales. I shall certainly get the other figures for the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has now given us the figures of expenditure for civil legal aid in England and Wales and for criminal legal aid in England and Wales in the magistrates' courts. Has he any figures for the cost of legal aid in the Crown courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend anticipates my very next statement, which is that the cost of legal aid in the Crown court—which is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary —is now about £23 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year the number of claims submitted by solicitors for advice and assistance given by them under the green form scheme was aproximately 323,000. Over 147,000 legal aid certificates were issued in 1977–78 to cover actual legal proceedings and more than 20,000 of those certificates were for non-matrimonial proceedings in the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These figures indicate that the scheme still permits a large number of people to pursue their remedies or defend their rights in the courts at a cost that they can at least afford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are these figures net after recovery of some legal aid contributions from persons assisted or are they gross figures before such recovery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to wish I had not given the figures. They are net after deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given those figures and indicated that there are still a large number of people who benefit from legal aid, but the package of improvements which my noble Friend intends to introduce will substantially increase the coverage of the scheme and benefit many more people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend is determined that the package should ensure that such resources as are available should go first to those in greatest need—namely, those on low earnings, families with low incomes and pensioners. I know that everyone will agree that the present low limits cause considerable hardship in those areas, and my noble Friend is determined to do all he can to end or ease that hardship as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as improvements are made in the financial limits of the scheme, my noble Friend intends to take the opportunity to make a determined effort to reduce the present complexity of the financial conditions for obtaining legal aid. They are complex and, like the social security regulations, are a real jungle. He is determined also to simplify the present complicated and expensive system of legal aid assessment. This will
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
result, one hopes, in making even further resources available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, it is not possible, much as I should have liked to do so, to give details of those proposals now, but I have been able to tell the Committee what my noble Friend has in mind as to his strategy for the future. The aim is to benefit those in greatest need to the greatest possible extent from the amounts which have become available, but this aim can be met only if the package can be worked out properly. That is why at this stage I do not think that it would benefit anybody if I were to try to be more precise than I have been. To work out the package it is necessary to adapt the existing scheme and those parts which can be adjusted to meet that need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could hint at some of the considerations which my noble Friend must and does bear in mind. The prime regulators are the upper and lower limits both as to income and capital and the amount which is taken by way of contribution once the disposable income or capital of the applicant exceeds the lower limit. In making adjustments one must not only take into account current earnings but also the pattern of what are loosely now called welfare benefits, and also—which is more important in this sphere—the highly complex system of disregards and discretions used in the assessment of disposable income and capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Committee will know, the assessment of a person's resources is made in accordance with the Legal Aid (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1960. Work is still proceeding on seeing whether it is possible to simplify those complex matters, and my noble Friend hopes to be able to give details of the scheme by early next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significant improvements which result from the package of changes will, I hope, be introduced in the early part of next year, and its basis will be to ensure that there is a substantial increase in the lower limit, namely, the limit below which legal aid is available without contribution. It is this move which will assist those in greatest need. It is also this which enables us to make a start on the simplification of the legal aid assessment procedure. There will be accompanying appropriate increases in the allowances
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
for dependants to ensure that such improvements as are made will also benefit those with families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned that one of the regulators is the amount which is taken from an applicant by way of contribution. At the moment the amount of the contribution asked of assisted persons is fixed by statute and cannot be changed by regulation. Accordingly, my noble Friend intends to include in the legal aid Bill which, as hon. Members will know, was referred to in the Queen's Speech, a regulation-making power enabling him to adjust the amount of contribution to be called for. This is a crucial and important part of the proposal. Clearly, if the contribution payable by those only just above the limit at which legal aid is free is made smaller, this affects the general figures for financial eligibility. The Bill is therefore an integral part of my noble Friend's proposals, and he is hoping to introduce it in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the lower limits are increased it is, of course, necessary to make corresponding increases in the upper eligibility limit, namely, the limit above which people are not able to obtain legal aid. My noble Friend's intention is to bring back into the scheme by an increase in this limit a large number of households who have ceased to be eligible for legal aid. It has been indicated in successive Committees that at the lower level of income one can obtain legal aid but over a certain level, even if one's income is fairly modest, one is denied the benefit. That is a deficiency which my noble Friend hopes to eradicate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter has been dealt with not only in our Committees but also in the Report of the Legal Aid Advisory Committee. Mention is made of it in paragraph 15 of their 26th annual report. The report concluded that the percentage of the population eligible for legal aid had dropped significantly. Hon. Members have made that point many times. My noble Friend's proposals should help to restore much of the lost ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the income limits are increased, it will be necessary to increase both the lower and upper capital limits. My noble Friend intends to do that as well. Clearly there would have to be corresponding increases in the limits for advice and assistance under the green form scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I should make it clear that this package of proposals is without prejudice to any consideration by the Government of whatever recommendations may be made by the Royal Commission on Legal Services. As the Committee knows, the Royal Commission is dealing with a number of very important matters affecting legal services, including the proper balance between the legal aid scheme and publicly funded legal services, such as those rendered by law centres and citizens' advice bureaux, as well as with the difficult question of representation before tribunals. It would not be right for the Government to make additional commitments in these areas until the Royal Commission has reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, one area where my noble Friend is resolved to give help, as he said in another place. I refer to help for law centres, which are an essential part of legal services, working in areas of greatest need. They are the very areas which my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor hopes to assist through his package. The package will, therefore, include some modest reinforcements for them pending the outcome of the Royal Commission's deliberations. I hope that what I have said indicates the determination of my noble Friend to put this package to the best possible use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister can give the Committee the percentage figure that contributions make to the whole package? Is it 10 per cent., 20 per cent, or 5 per cent.? If that figure is available, it would be of help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend answers, may I point out that he gave us comparative figures for 1975–76 and 1977–78 for all categories except Crown courts. In respect of Crown courts legal aid expenditure, he gave only the figures for 1977–78, as I understood him. In order to assess what increase, if any, there was for 1975–76, can he give the Committee the figures for that period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that what I have said, even though I have said it at some length, will indicate that this package will bring within the legal aid scheme many people who are at present denied its benefits.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition welcome these proposals. In view of earlier events in the Committee, I believe that our sense of humour would be much increased if the extra-mural facilities which seem to come into our proceedings from time to time were made generally available. Therefore, if I get into any difficulty, perhaps I may pray them in aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the most important subject of legal aid, it is refreshing to note that a number of lawyers on both sides of the Committee are not benefiting from the legal aid scheme but are sitting here for no remuneration at all—indulging in the annual canter, if I may so put it, around the legal aid course. We welcome to these proceedings certain new faces and many already familiar. It is refreshing that this is now a holding operation. I hope that it will be the beginning of a general move, whichever party happens to form the Government of the day, to take on this matter and get over it, because, under successive Governments, it has got into a sorry and sad state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having concentrated as much as I could on the figures as they were given to us, I was struck by one point. I am dealing now with civil legal aid and not particularly entering the realms of criminal legal
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
aid. I am sure that many members of the Committee will agree that the two matters are very different. On the increased costs in terms of civil legal aid, I understand that the Lord Chancellor's new proposals, depending upon financial constraints and policies, will increase to a total of £6 million over successive years. At the moment we have been hovering just above supplementary benefit level year by year in terms of "upping" the maximum and minimum rates. The figures of natural increase given by the Lord Chancellor in another place and by the Minister here today run from £26 million in 1975–76 to £38 million—that is to say, an increase of £12 million with the constraints under which we have been working from year to year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another place—I dare say that the Minister will accept this cautionary note—the Minister said that in introducing the promise of proposals and in talking of a boom, as it were, in the early months of next year, the great danger is that in the event everybody will be disappointed. I am not trying to pour cold water on that view, but I return to my first point and emphasise that we are at the beginning of what I hope will be a long and continuing road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to comment on the view taken by successive Governments. It is fair to say that the debate in another place was bristling with legal eminence, with former Lord Chancellors leaping up all over the Chamber. A former Lord Chancellor and a Labour Member described in striking terms the present position. I quote the noble and learned Lord, Lord Gardiner who could not have expressed the position better:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, the sad point about the whole of its history is the extent to which successive Governments have deprived people of their existing rights. As I have ventured to say on a previous occasion, it is absolutely useless for any Government to continue passing legislation, conferring rights on poor people or people of moderate means, if they cannot afford to enforce or defend their rights. If they cannot afford to enforce or defend their rights, they might just as well throw their rights into the wastepaper basket for all the good they are to them."—
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 14th November 1978; Vol. 396, c. 676.]</p></blockquote>
In a nutshell, that is what we are about today. It is refreshing to know that at least we are moving in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a commentary on the state of our legal governmental administration—this is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
not a party point but a general point which applies to lawyers and lawyer-politicians of whichever party happens to be in power—that over the years, particularly on this aspect, we have not received our fair share of the cake. In governmental terms, legal administration is divided three ways—namely, among the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Minister's own Department. Although many representations have been made—and one appreciates the difficulties—none of them appears to have done very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim must be—accepting the financial constraints on any Government—to return as quickly as we can to where we started in 1950. The figures are striking. Although the Minister referred to them, he did not quote them. Perhaps the most graphic figure is that 80 per cent, of the total population were covered in 1950 but that had gone down to 40 per cent, in 1973. Indeed, for married couples with children, the 1964 figure of 60 per cent, dropped to 20 per cent, in 1974. Those figures come from the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Legal Aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one compares the natural increase—even when one tinkers with the figures just above supplementary benefit —of £12 million over two years with the £6 million that will go in next year, one begins to appreciate all the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt so far with civil legal aid, but there is also the matter of criminal legal aid. Furthermore, predominantly on the civil front, there is the whole question of extensions to the legal aid system. We are very much at the beginning of consideration of the subject. I am also referring to legal aid for those who appear before tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made a start because certain tribunals now receive the benefit of the legal aid scheme. However, there are still many glaring gaps. It was mentioned in another place that industrial tribunals are rapidly becoming one of the busiest sectors of tribunal activity. It appears that in that area nobody wants legal aid. As the Lord Chancellor said, there is a complexity of matters that can arise in such tribunals. I think that they should be covered by the scheme. However, if somebody does not want legal aid and is adequately represented by an experienced trade union official, or some-
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
one else, so much the better. No one needs to apply for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the complex case, and particularly with the person who might not be covered by his trade union in such proceedings. We know the various issues that can arise. The person concerned may, in effect, be going against his trade union and may have to "go it alone". Those are important matters which should be considered. There is a formidable case for an extension of legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that all this involves money, but at least a sum of £6 million is coming into the kitty. I welcome that package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice the general welcome which has been given to further expenditure on legal aid and the indication that any Government should expand such expenditure. Without wishing to be polemical in any way, having regard to the general argument of his party that public expenditure must be cut in genera], is the hon. Gentleman in a position to undertake, on behalf of any future Conservative Government, that they will expand the provision of legal aid on the lines of his argument? In virtually all individual cases they appear to advocate that it must rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Temple-Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspected that somebody would raise that point. I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman should do so, because I thought that we were talking as lawyers as much as politicians. Accepting the matter at the political level—in deference to the hon. and learned Gentleman's point, it is something which he is entitled to ask, but the answer is in the negative. I am not in a position to make any undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was obvious from what I said that the same struggles—I tried to put the matter in a practical way—will go on between the divided legal Administration, whoever is in Government. I repeat that point—which is, with respect, far more important than the party point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman—that those struggles have to be vigorously pursued by whoever is in power. Knowing the natural ability of those who in future are likely to ornament the legal Front Bench of the Conservative Party, I hope that they will do a little better than the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
£6 million that for the moment has to suffice. But there it is, and hon. Members on both sides know perfectly well that anything which smacks of more money for lawyers and courts does not automatically go down well with the majority of people. It is bridges of that kind that we must cross. We must make plain, as we are increasingly doing, that we are dealing with valid and important social causes as well as with the numerous appearance of lawyers in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.6 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly, but first I wish to comment on the intervention of the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons). It is quite extraordinary and a great condemnation of the present Government that, although the Labour Party believes in massive public expenditure and has over the past four years grossly increased public expenditure, the legal aid situation is as bad as it was in 1974. It would be understandable, if not creditable, if a party which did not wish to increase public expenditure failed to deal with the subject of legal aid. Over the past few years we have witnessed a massive increase in public expenditure, but legal aid has received such low priority with the present Government that it has in no way benefited from this increase. I suggest that Labour Members should take that as a matter of shame rather than of praise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman advocating that there should have been even greater public expenditure? Alternatively, is he saying that something else should have gone to the wall so that more resources would have been available for legal aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point that I am seeking to make. Over the past four years legal aid has had such a low priority in the policies of the Government that it has failed to benefit in any way, despite massive increases in public expenditure during that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister indicated that his proposals today were no more than a modest improvement, which is clearly the case. They cover inflation only over the past year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I put three questions to the Minister which I hope he will deal with in his reply. First, he indicated that his noble Friend the Lord Chancellor is presently carrying out a detailed survey of the need to improve the legal aid system. We clearly welcome that. But will he indicate why it is not possible at this stage to increase the limits? Perhaps it is not possible now to change the regulations or to introduce an overall reform of the whole system, but there is no immediately ascertainable legal reason why increases greater than those provided for cannot be made now if the Government genuinely wish to improve legal aid. To say that we must wait until 1979 for any significant increases to be introduced seems an unfair and unsound principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question that I wish to ask—this issue was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris)—is whether the Lord Chancellor, in producing this new scheme, will be considering the extension of entitlement to legal aid to tribunals or to other bodies where legal aid is not at present applicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister throughout his speech referred to the fact that his noble Friend the Lord Chancellor was working out new regulations for the new scheme for legal aid. Is he co-operating with the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Lord Advocate in that work? I hope that he is, because one is sometimes suspicious that the Lord Chancellor's office works out schemes of this nature and that they are simply accepted lock, stock and barrel at the end of the day by the Scottish Office. We know that circumstances in Scotland can sometimes be different in terms of the detail of the schemes required. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will assure us that at this early stage the Scottish Office, in the form of the Under-Secretary who is present today, or the Lord Advocate's Department is fully involved in the initial preparation of the new schemes which are to be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that, at present, one gets the benefit of our legal system only if one is very poor or very rich. If one is very poor, one comes within the limits provided for in the regulations. If one is very rich, the absence of legal aid does not inhibit one from pursuing one's legal entitlement. It is the vast majority of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
people somewhere in the middle who suffer under our present system. They are neither wealthy enough to pursue legal actions without bankrupting themselves if they fail to succeed, nor poor enough to get the benefit of these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any substantial change in the present system is to be welcomed. It would be churlish for anyone not to feel absolutely delighted that at last the Government are to introduce general improvements. We shall have to see what form the improvements take before deciding whether they deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.10 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These proposals basically represent an inflation-adjusted increase of about 8 per cent, to take account of this year's increase in inflation. Therefore, the debate is not about what is taking place this morning. We are actually debating the proposals likely to be introduced next year. It would be virtually impossible to have much of a debate on this morning's proposals. However, if my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary had not mentioned or discussed proposals for increases next year, there would probably have been a row about the niggardliness of these proposals. By mentioning next year's proposals, he has avoided that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) that these days legal aid in civil terms applies only to the very poor, because the wealthy do not need it. When I say the "very poor", I exclude working class people, because very few of them will benefit from the present system. The figures are far too low. Therefore we have wandered a long way from the original idea for the scheme in 1950.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I exempt legal aid in criminal cases. It is obvious to those who attend criminal courts that people of reasonable means are receiving legal aid without too much inquiry or difficulty. But that is a different issue. The people about whom we should be concerned are those with difficult problems in their everyday life. We live in a complex society. Such people —and this applies to most of the community—are utterly at a loss when dealing with complicated cases and, in certain cases they cannot receive full legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
There is, of course, the growth of law centres. But the Minister has not indicated to what except that fact affects his figures. Presumably the growth of law centres, which have to be financed, will mean that fewer people will require legal advice under the legal aid scheme. Will the Minister indicate what impact the syphoning off of work to law centres is likely to have on costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor is very keen on law centres. I feel that it is early days yet to judge them. The pattern is likely to be uneven with successful operation in some areas, but operation in other areas attracting much criticism. I think that the lawyers working in law centres will be very young. They will not have experienced lawyers whom they can consult or the example of mature lawyers dealing with matters. However, we are not concerned with law centres this morning, except in so far as they relate to costs for legal aid and the inroads that they will make into the demands for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures that we have been given this morning include those for crime. It is obvious that, even if we do not alter the conditions for legal aid and do not raise the remuneration for lawyers involved in criminal cases, the amount necessary for legal aid in criminal cases will continue to rise because there is more crime and the police are increasing their detection rate. Therefore, many more people are brought before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the growth of sophistication of attitudes and the lessons that are learned from watching television detective thrillers, many people feel that it is worth having a go to see whether they can get an acquittal. They are entitled to proclaim their innocence, and doubtless some of them are innocent. But it is also a fact that the average length of trials in Britain is increasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly in England and Wales. Not only are we having more trials and more people before the courts generally in criminal cases, but in addition the average length of defended cases is growing. That means that more money is required from the State in cases where legal aid is involved. Unless a separation is made between legal aid in criminal and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
civil cases—and the system of enforcing law and order must continue—a growing priority will be given to expenditure on legal aid in criminal cases, which in turn will leave less money for legal aid in civil cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeing that process already in the sense that legal aid has largely been withdrawn from undefended divorce, and it is clear that it is becoming more difficult for people to obtain legal aid in civil cases because the limits are not raised. At the same time one sees a large increase in crime taking up more and more resources. In the end, unless there is a large increase in resources to legal aid, there will be a gradual transference of resources from legal aid in civil actions to criminal cases. In fact, that is already happening. My guess is that had the bills for criminal legal aid not gone up as much as they have over the years, there would now be a more generous attitude than there has been towards civil legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, Governments will have to face head on the question of how much they are prepared to support a civil legal aid scheme. I do not see any real way of saving substantial sums of money in criminal legal aid, because it would be entirely wrong to interfere with the right of persons to be represented in matters which affect personal liberty. As there is no indication of a substantial reduction in the rising curve of crime, we shall require more money for criminal legal aid. I hope, therefore, that the Government, and succeeding Governments, will bear in mind the need to allot funds specifically and generously for civil legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the figures that have been given to us this morning are not for succeeding years, but for one year measured against a figure two years later. Of course, some of the increase is measured purely in inflation terms. Therefore, it is not a real increase. I suspect that the increase in the criminal legal aid figure is due not to the remuneration of those involved in the process having gone up, but to more people appearing before the courts. It may be that my hon. Friend will be able to enlighten us about that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, I suppose that today's increases, small though they are, are to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
welcomed. The Minister has not told us how many extra people will benefit by today's proposals. I should think not more than 50 or 100 people—or, at any rate, a tiny figure. How many extra people will be caught by raising the minimum disposable income level from £48 to £52? None of the Ford workers will be involved, and will derive no advantage. What is happening this morning is purely cosmetic and can be justified only as a temporary operation pending proposals next year. I suppose that one should therefore leave the real debate until then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.20 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering legal aid and in considering the new scheme—and I assume that there will be separate Bills for Scotland and England —it is important to remember two principles. Legal aid is entitled to give equality of rights before the law and equality of access to the law—or, as the Minister quaintly put it, nobody should be denied the benefits of a lawyer. I thought that it was gracious of him to bestow upon us the concept that it is a benefit to have a lawyer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To have the hon. and learned Gentleman is clearly a benefit. It may not apply to all lawyers, but certainly it applies to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister. At the same time, one must consider another risk in the provision of legal aid—namely, the possibility of an imbalance among the parties before the law. It is important that legal aid should not enable a litigious person to have a benefit over a defender in Scotland—or defendant in England—who is not able to enjoy his full rights because of the benefits that the power of legal aid gives to the litigant. It is important always that a balance should be kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the necessity for more funds, and the equally grave necessity for the restriction of the expenditure of public funds—which are private funds extracted from the public by the Government—one other source of funds might be looked at in the coming new scheme. A very large number of litigants in civil legal aid are not private citizens at all when it comes to consideration of their resources. Many reparation cases involve people who are injured at work and who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
essentially are backed by a trade union with very great funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another very large category of litigants on one side or the other are, even though they are private citizens, backed by an insurance company with very large funds. It has always seemed to me unfortunate that some people who ought to get legal aid are deprived of it—people who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) said, fall neither into the category of poverty nor into that of richness but who fall between the two—when others obtain legal aid on the basis of their apparent disposable income and capital, when in reality they are backed by a trade union or an insurance company or a vast organisation with limitless funds. It may be that in a case of reparation where any party has the back-up resources of an organisation with resources, that factor should be taken into account so that those who do not have that benefit should be able to obtain legal assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several categories of the population are denied the true benefits of legal aid. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, and also the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, to consider very carefully in the new scheme the question of disposable capital. If a person is a small businessman or is self-employed, or is a district nurse or postmistress or someone of that kind, he or she is likely, in order to provide for retirement, to save as a matter of practice. If they make modest savings of more than £365, that will not help much in their retirement, but it has always seemed to me to be quite wrong that, because a person has made a modest saving, that capital can be removed from them if they undergo litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person may fall on a pavement or fall off a bus and lose his savings, whereas the spendthrift person or the person who is employed rather than self-employed, and therefore has pension schemes or other benefits, does not have that disadvantage. In other words, the State says, "Ah, you have a nest-egg, so you cannot have legal aid." I should like the Parliamentary Secretary—and particularly the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, because there is no reason why we should not be different in these matters —to consider the abolition of the interest on capital. Those who are rich enough to go to law will not be touched. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
disposable capital of those on the fringe of legal aid is affected, it seems that we are penalising them unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what "disposal capital" is defined as or what it amounts to, but I assume that a motor car might be so regarded, although I do not know whether that is accurate. But a person might have an asset regarded as disposable capital which was essential, or at any rate beneficial, to his life. It is important that this long-lasting wrong should be remedied in the new scheme. I prefer that the concept of disposal capital should be left out of consideration for legal aid for the reason that it is unfair to people with modest savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know the percentage figure for contributions. If the figures are very small, there are disadvantages to those who are on the fringe of the scheme. If they are of considerable benefit that must be taken into account because funds are necessary for the scheme. If they are not, we should consider forgetting them. We are trying to achieve through legal aid a situation in which every citizen is equal before the law and has an equal opportunity of the benefits of legal remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say something about the difference in criminal legal aid in England and Scotland, and I ask for the figures. In civil legal aid, the scheme is identical. I believe I am accurate in saying that it was brought into effect in Scotland and in England on the same date by separate Acts in 1950. But one of the gross slurs on Scotland—I notice that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) is not here, so I can say something of a slightly national character—is that while England has had the benefit of criminal legal aid from, I believe, 1952, it was brought in only over the dead bodies of Ministers in Scotland in 1964. They resisted it in Scotland for 15 years, and even now the method of its application is infinitely more stringent than it is in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, the amount of fees recoverable in England in a case in the Crown Court compared to the amount of fees recoverable in a case in the High Court in Scotland is dramatically different. If we are short of funds and Scotland is to continue to have these restraints and restrictions, then let them be applied in England. If the hon. and learned Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) is right when he says that crime will be so rampant and that all the funds will be needed for criminal cases, I believe that if Scotland is able to put restraints on itself, there is no reason why England should not do so as well. What is the amount spent on criminal legal aid in Scotland compared to what is spent in England? We do not have magistrates' hearings in Scotland, so that halves the number of hearings. Nor do we have opening speeches in Scotland, so that infinitely reduces the time taken. It is very rare indeed in Scotland to have criminal trials that last more than one or two days. Occasionally, a trial may last a fortnight or a fraud trial for three weeks, but that is rare. However, in England, as the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West said, the length of trials seems to be increasing and the time taken is vastly disproportionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a maximum figure that a solicitor can obtain in the High Courts in Scotland—unless he can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that, by the inevitable nature of the proceedings, the trial was of unusual length, complexity or difficulty, otherwise he just receives a token sum. The fact that it does not cover his costs is just his bad luck. If those restraints can be applied in Scotland I see no reason why they should not be applied in England. If they are not to be applied in England, I see no reason why they should be applied in Scotland. It is an opportunity for saving or it is an opportunity for equity—or both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope that that difference will be remedied under the new scheme. I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will watch the position carefully. For some reason Scottish Ministers have always been a bit frightened of the Lord Chancellor. I think they believe that he still has the power of life and death. Let me assure the Scottish Office that he no longer has such a power. He is just an ordinary, humble equal citizen, noble though he may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those few remarks, I generally welcome what does not amount to an increase. If one looks at the figures which the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West was suggesting, one would find that fewer were brought into the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
scheme by our changes than have fallen out of it since the last increase was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should like to ask one question, why is it that the disposable income amount is increased by 8½ per cent. The amount of disposable income exceeds £760—an increase of 14 per cent.—and disposable capital appears to be an increase of 6¼ per cent? That is according to my mathematics, which perhaps is not my strong point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, behind our thinking on legal aid must always be the principle that all parties should be put in a position of equality, so that they are able to defend an allegation which is made against them or a claim made upon them. They must not be afraid of defending an action for fear that their property, capital, or savings, will be at risk if they litigate, win or lose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Harry Ewing)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always said that these Committees are made up of lawyers and those of us that bring common sense to such matters. It would be a great pity if the voice of common sense was to remain unheard today. It would also be a great pity if all we had was a discussion between lawyers about legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main purpose in contributing to the debate is to put on record some of the expenditure figures in Scotland against the background of what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) said. I want to make abundantly clear that I accept the criticism that the number of people qualifying has drastically fallen since the introduction of the scheme from about 80 per cent, to the present level of about 20 per cent. This is a dilemma in which Governments have been for some time. Expenditure goes up at a dramatic pace on legal aid, but the number of people benefiting from that increased expenditure goes down at almost the same dramatic rate.

In talking of the package that is to be introduced by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, I should say immediately that it will apply to Scotland. The Scottish Office and, I imagine, although I cannot speak for it, the Lord Advocate's Department, have been involved in the discussions putting together that package. I reassure the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands, that the package will extend to Scotland. I hope that I have, therefore, dealt with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the figures, it is interesting to see the movement in expenditure on legal aid between 1974—the base year that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands drew on for his comparison—and the present year. Although the figures for 1977–78 have not yet been published I can give an estimate. In 1974–75 expenditure on legal aid in Scotland, both civil and criminal, was £3·57 million. In 1975–76 the figure was £4·93 million. In 1976–77 the figure was £5·94 million. This year, although the figure has not yet been published and is, therefore, subject to correction, it is expected that legal aid for both civil and criminal cases in Scotland will amount to about £9 million. That is a massive increase, not only between 1974 and 1978 but between 1977 and 1978. This, therefore, is the dilemma that we are in. Public expenditure is being increased but benefiting fewer and fewer people. One of the reasons that it has been necessary for my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, and those of us involved in the matter, to come forward, as we will, in the months ahead with this package is precisely because of the situation I have illustrated and the figures I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his estimated figure for the current year. If that figure is correct it will be an almost 50 per cent, increase over last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister indicated that these are combined figures for both criminal and civil legal aid. Will he confirm that, given the fairly modest increase in the rates for civil legal aid that were discussed in this Committee last year, the explanation for that increase is not a more generous entitlement to legal aid but the substantial increase in crime in Scotland over the year and the far greater number of people
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
seeking legal aid to defend criminal rather than civil actions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The main reason for the increase to the estimated £9 million has been because we have extended legal aid in Scotland—for example, to the district courts. It was not possible previously to have legal aid in the old burgh police courts, but with the introduction of district courts in Scotland we extended legal aid. When the figures are published and analysed it will be seen that there has been a fair take-up of legal aid in the district courts in Scotland. With respect to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands I believe that is possibly one of the principal reasons for this fairly substantial increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Temple-Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point has already been covered. It was identical to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). However, to take it a stage further—one is interested because of the obvious comparison between English and Scottish criminal legal aid systems—will the Minister be able to tell us how he will split the increases between civil and criminal legal aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figures on the division between civil and criminal legal aid. If I receive the figures before the end of my remarks I shall certainly give them to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) drew out the point about the difference between the qualifications for criminal legal aid in Scotland 
	<i>vis-a-vis</i> England and the difference between the qualifications for civil and criminal legal aid in Scotland. Civil legal aid in Scotland is granted by the committee system, whereas criminal legal aid in Scotland is granted by the presiding court judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal aid is based on a number of factors, not least being the estimated length of the case. It is very difficult for a court to estimate how long a case may last. There was a case in Scotland some two years ago where substantial legal aid was granted on the basis that the case would last between seven and nine weeks, but in the event it lasted only a few days. The estimate was so far out that it left one wondering exactly what sort of considerations had been taken into account.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
However, in the same case another defendant was refused legal aid, on the basis of his capital means and other considerations. There are fairly massive differences—not in the provision of legal aid, but in the qualification for criminal legal aid in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now have the figures that I had sought. I should like to give them to the Committee at this point and I ask hon. Members to do their own subtractions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Civil legal aid in 1974–75 in Scotland amounted to £1·313 million—that is, from the total of £3·57 million. In 1975–76 it was £1·350 million, from the total of £4·93 million. In 1976–77 the figure was £1·644 million, from the total of £5·94 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Criminal legal aid was £1·310 million in 1974–75. In 1975–76 it was £2·096 million and in 1976–77 it was £2·8 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands, who said that criminal legal aid was outstripping civil legal aid, will see the trend in those figures developing along the road that he suspected. It would appear that this is indeed the case. I suspect that the growth in the 1977–78 figure is primarily because we extended legal aid to the district courts in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am probably being very slow, but can the Minister explain to the Committee why the civil legal aid figures and the criminal legal aid figures that he has given do not add up to the total legal aid which he stated was paid out in those years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That occurred to me as I was giving the figures; they had just been thrust into my hand. I am sure that there is some marvellous explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference arises because of the Children's Scheme, the Legal Advice and Assistance Scheme—and lo and behold, where lawyers are involved—very high administrative costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend said was that in 1977–78 the combined total cost in Scotland was £9 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Estimated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, estimated. We have been given figures by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary today, which when added up show that civil and crim-
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
inal aid combined in all courts in Britain during 1977–78 cost £81 million. The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) said "Ah, but in Scotland it is much cheaper than in England." However, I calculate that £9 million in relation to £81 million is one-ninth. Since the Scottish population is in fact less than one-ninth of the population of England and Wales, the legal aid scheme in England and Wales costs less than it does in Scotland. Therefore, there is something wrong with the arguments advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If £2·8 million for criminal legal aid in 1976–77 is accurate and the figure for England for the Crown courts and for the criminal courts is £43 million, it looks as though England represents about 20-to-l for a population ratio of 1-to-ll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to leave my two lawyer friends to continue that over a cup of something somewhere else. I do not wish to get involved between them. It is always dangerous to come between lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) say that we would cross those bridges when we came to them. I always regard lawyers as people who refuse to cross bridges even when they do come to them. I am sure that the hon. and learned Member for Kniross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) will be able to sort out their difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one final point. I confess that it is a political point, but I do not apologise for that. Another dilemma is that people, such as the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, as politicians, make speeches about increased powers for the police and all that goes with that—we shall have an opportunity to debate that at a later stage—and at the same time, as lawyers, say that we need increased resources for legal aid for people to defend themselves against the increased powers for which, as politicians, they are asking. There is therefore a conflict of interest in speaking as a politician, on the one hand, and as a lawyer, on the other, which is left to those of us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
who have responsibility for these matters to try to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that criminal legal aid was introduced in Scotland only in 1964. It is equally true that it was resisted for 15 years. It was introduced in England 15 years before it was introduced in Scotland. It took the Labour Government of 1964 to introduce it against 13 years of resistance by the Conservative Government between 1951 and 1964. I hope that will be a lesson to the people of Scotland as we get nearer to the next General Election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should answer one or two—indeed all, if possible—of the questions which have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) referred to the £6 million. He gave a very fair speech, as he always does, but he indicated that he was a little disappointed at the figure. As he knows, every Department of State has had to make its contribution to the public expenditure cuts which the Conservative Party has vigorously demanded. The Lord Chancellor's Department has been no exception. The £6 million is, of course, at 1978 values. That means that one takes account of inflation—under this Government the rate of inflation is low and we hope that it will continue to be low—and revalues the figure from year to year. The hon. Gentleman will know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Rifkind), with his usual precision, asked three questions, one of which I think has been answered by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. First, he asked why I, on behalf of the Lord Chancellor—or, indeed, the Lord Chancellor himself, which would be far better—could not announce the increase in the upper and lower limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I indicated earlier, the increase in both the lower and the upper limits depends on a number of factors. One is the Legal Aid Bill. The proposals in that Bill affect the fraction—that is, the amount of contribution taken from the applicant. That in turn affects the lower free income limit, which again in turn affects the higher income limit. It would be easier to increase the limits at both ends of the scale, but that would not solve the problem. Certainly it would not deal with the problem of those who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
just above the lower income limit and who have to make contributions and suffer great hardship as a result. It is the Lord Chancellor's desire to take those people firmly into consideration and to try to ease the burden of contributions from such people. That is why it would not be possible at this stage to do what the hon. Gentleman asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that his second question concerned the Lord Chancellor's policy with regard to legal aid for tribunals. This matter is being considered by the Royal Commission, and it would not be right at this stage to try to anticipate what the Law Commission may say. Obviously my noble Friend would have to take account of that report. It would not be right to act prematurely or in anticipation of that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) mentioned the growth of law centres. He indicated that law centres were likely to take away work from solicitors. That is not necessarily so. As he will know, one of the purposes of law centres is to give advice to people who would probably not go to a solicitor. In any event, if those who go to a law centre are eligible, they can apply for legal aid. They can also get legal advice and assistance from law centres on the green form scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend made quite a long speech, but I hope that I have answered his questions. If there are any questions that I have not answered, I am sure he will take the opportunity of putting them to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), with remarkable alacrity, assessed the percentage increase on the figures that I gave. I think that I am guilty. I think he may have misheard me. I hope that I said that the increase was from £760 to £815. I may well have said £850. If so, I should like to take this opportunity of correcting it. The hon. and learned Gentleman, with his mathematical ability, will know that is about 7 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman also suggested that it would be desirable if consideration could be given to the withholding of legal aid from those who have the benefit of representation from trade unions or similar bodies. I assure him that is already the case. Regulation 5(13)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
of the Legal Aid (General) Regulations 1971 provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice… an application [for legal aid] may be refused: —(
	<i>d</i>) where it appears to the appropriate committee that the applicant has available rights or facilities making it unnecessary for him to obtain legal aid or has a reasonable expectation of obtaining financial or other help from a body of which he is a member, and has failed, in the opinion of the committee, to take all reasonable steps to enforce or obtain such rights, facilities or help including permitting the appropriate committee to take those steps on his behalf."</p></blockquote>
I think that covers the point. The power is in fact already there with the legal aid committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for drawing that to my attention. I would be interested to know whether in practice this is done, because frequently—although not recently, but when I was more junior—I have taken part in litigation against the National Coal Board, and it was an extremely rare case when the pursuer, as he is called in Scotland, was not legally aided. I imagine that they were all members of the National Union of Mineworkers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One must assume that the committees, which are composed of lawyers and responsible people act in accordance with the regulations. The terms "lawyers" and "responsible people" are mutually exclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. and learned Gentleman asked what percentage of civil legal aid funding comes from contributions. As he knows, if the applicant wins and the costs are to come from the other party, his contributions are refunded. But the amount of contributions retained in 1977–78—these are figures for England and
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Wales, because I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will ask if they apply to Scotland—was £3,642,346. The hon. and learned Gentleman dealt at some length with the contribution fraction. I can tell him that the contribution fraction is a third of the difference between the lower level of eligibility and the person's disposable income. I hope that that has answered the many questions in what has been a very interesting debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
