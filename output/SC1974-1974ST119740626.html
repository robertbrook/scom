	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT CARRIAGE BY RAILWAY (REVISION OF CONVENTIONS) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Gerald Kaufman)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the Order in Council is to make certain amendments to the schedule to the Carriage by Railway Act 1972 which are consequential on the revision of an international convention relating to the liability of the railway for the death of, and personal injury to, passengers. This convention is known as the Additional Convention, and the schedule to the 1972 Act contains the text of its provisions, except for some provisions of a formal nature. The original text of the Additional Convention and of a protocol containing the amendments have been presented to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is a party to three railway conventions referred to in the Carriage by Railway Act 1972 as the Railway Passenger, Railway Freight and Additional Conventions. The passenger and freight conventions are more commonly known by the initials of their French titles as the CIM and CIV Conventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 9 of the 1972 Act provides a procedure for amending the Act by Order in Council to take account of amendments agreed upon from time to time through the international procedures laid down in the conventions. The amendments to the Additional Convention which are the subject of the draft Order in Council before the Committee today are consequential on amendments to the passenger and freight conventions. These three conventions are linked together by a common revision procedure which provides for the holding of a revision conference five years after entry into force.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Amendments are then incorporated into new conventions. Once these have been signed and ratified by at least 15 States—a fairly exotic collection of States, I may say, since the draft convention has valid languages not only in French, which is the main one, but in English and even Arabic—a date is fixed for them to come into force and the previous conventions cease to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last revision conference was held in 1970 before the Additional Convention had come into force. A date, 1st January 1975, has now been fixed for the 1970 freight and passenger conventions to come into force. But the Additional Convention, which has been in force only since the beginning of 1973, contains references to the passenger and freight conventions of 1961. It also has the same duration as the passenger convention of 1961 and would have ceased to apply at the end of 1974 unless it had been amended and linked with the passenger convention of 1970. A date in October 1974 has been referred to as the date by which the ratification has to be got through the House. It would be otiose of me to refer to the hazards of waiting a little later in the year if we are to get it through during this Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The outline of the procedures may seem very complicated—to no member of the Committee more than to myself—but the procedures laid down in Section 9 of the 1972 Act are a convenient way of avoiding the need for a new Act every time the conventions are revised. The amendments now before the Committee are of a minor nature, but it is essential to go through these procedures so that the United Kingdom may ratify the revised conventions and enable them to fulfil their practical purposes in international transport, which are of real value. It is in the interest of railways and railway users that the United Kingdom shall continue to be a party to the international railway conventions. They enable railways to issue through consignment notes and tickets, and they give traders and passengers a guarantee that uniform rules concerning railway liability will be applied in the event of claims for compensation arising from loss or damage, and death or personal injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Committee would wish me to refer to the fact that it was my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Ogden), with the support of the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), who introduced the Bill in 1972 which is now the Carriage by Railway Act 1972. I hope that the Committee will approve the resolution so that arrangements may be made for United Kingdom ratification of the new passenger and freight conventions and the protocol containing the amendments to the Additional Convention in good time before the ratification period expires on that significant date of 31st October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Daniel Awdry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I felt that my only role this morning was to ask the Minister to give us an explanation, and that he has done. He has given us a full explanation.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
When the Committee began, we felt that this was a complicated subject. I am sure that we all still feel that it is complicated, but it is clear that these amendments are of a minor and formal character. We understand the purpose and the explanation which the Minister has kindly given us, for which we are grateful, and we on this side of the Committee have no objection to the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
