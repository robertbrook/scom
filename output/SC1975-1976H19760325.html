	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned on Tuesday I was in the course of moving Amendment No. 98, in page 13, line 8, leave out paragraph (
	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing Amendment No. 99, in page 13, line 11, leave out paragraph (
	<i>d</i>) and Amendment No. 100, in page 13, leave out lines 13 to 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I speak for the Committee as a whole when I say what an inexpressible pleasure it is to us, Mrs. Jeger, to see you back in your place in the Chair [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear"]. This implies no disrespect to those who have occupied it temporarily, but there can be no substitute for the calm and gracious presence with which you alone are able to guide our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You reminded the Committee, Mrs. Jeger, that we are taking together, although clearly they raise separate points, amendments relating to paragraphs (
	<i>c</i>) and (
	<i>d</i>) and the concluding words of subsection (3). Perhaps I may briefly recapitulate what I said, so that I may put the precise questions which I hope the right hon. Gentleman or his colleague will be able to clarify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take first paragraph (
	<i>c</i>). I should like to explain by way of an analogy the difficulty which, 
	<i>prima facie,</i> we feel in respect of this paragraph. Let us suppose that the allegation referred to a misdemeanour or an offence other than an offence under this Bill. In that case, whether the allegation was or was not true, there would be remedy under existing law for whoever was injured by the making of that allegation, or by the truth of that allegation. My submission is that that
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
alternative applies equally to those damaged by allegations, true or false, of unlawful acts under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person goes about making unfounded allegations that employer X is discriminatory, as that is an unlawful act the employer has his remedy against that person under existing law and ought to seek it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if it be true that the employer is practising discrimination as defined in the Bill, it is the purpose of the Bill to apply a remedy, and those who seek that remedy will be protected against discrimination by the provisions of paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>). I hope that I have put sufficiently precisely to the right hon. Gentleman the reasons why it seems to us that paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is, for the purposes of the Bill, taking a whole category of offences as it were, out of the general law and out of the range of remedies provided by the general law. So much for paragraph (
	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to paragraph (
	<i>d</i>), and here the expression is so general that we should be obliged if the Minister of State could indicate the other types of act which might be done by persons other than those set out in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>), which might be the cause of his being victimised or would justify his having the protection against victimisation afforded by the subsection. So much for paragraph (
	<i>d</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the last words from which I select construing, I hope correctly, the particular words which seem to be to embody a quite extreme provision. I simply start with the words "by reason that" he suspects the person victimised intends to do any of the things set out in (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>), (
	<i>c</i>) and (
	<i>d</i>). For instance, one could have an employer alleging discrimination on the ground that he took a decision in the course of hiring, firing or promoting, and so on, by reason of the fact that he suspected X of intending to allege that he, the employer, had committed acts which, without that assertion being openly so made, would amount to a contravention of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to contemplate the remoteness and the subjectivity of the circumstances which are here envisaged. There are two layers of subjectivity at least, and there may be three. First, there is the layer of suspecting. We envisage circumstances in which an offence of discrimination, a contravention of the Act, would occur as a result of acts or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
omissions based upon a suspicion in the mind of the person who committed them. This might be very difficult to prove. I feel sure that the right hon. Gentleman will not take refuge in the fact that such a point might be difficult to prove in the ultimate stages of appeal for which this part of the Bill provides, because we are seriously considering whether it is necessary to provide safeguards against victimisation in the conditions set out in lines 13 to 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is not just one layer of subjectivity. One does not merely have to consider that the employer acted as he did because of a suspicion in his mind, a suspicion which he might not have communicated to anyone, a suspicion which might be well founded or ill-founded, malicious or genuine. But it could be a suspicion that the person victimised in the definitions of this clause intended to do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have got into remote regions of speculation where we are going to consider the act of am employer to see whether it reveals that he suspects that someone intends to do what, by definition, has not yet happened. To put the mansard roof upon, that doing may be no more than the making of an allegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, unless I have misconstrued the situation, what we are saying is that it is possible to make a complaint of victimisation and to do so on the ground that X, the employer, suspected that I intended to make an allegation. I really question whether the Committee can think it right to put that kind of provision into Acts of Parliament and either to open—if it is open, and if it is not open in practice let us not cumber up the Bill with it—such a recourse to the citizen or to put citizens at danger of the proceedings of the Bill on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments address three separate questions to the right hon. Gentleman. I hope he will agree to reconsider the acutely subjective regions into which the subsection is led by the last three lines. I am not necessarily complaining of the totality of those three lines, but I believe that we have gone too far into a cubing of the subjectivity on the basis of which victimisation could be alleged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
will recognise that victimisation is a difficult matter to prove, particularly in industry. I have had industrial experience and a great deal of negotiation on victimisation. A person is often not dismissed for the reason he may have suspected. He may have been dismissed for some other alleged misdemeanour, rather than for being an active trade unionist, or a member of a political party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, therefore, protect the right of a person making a complaint which involves his employer and protects him from victimisation. That is the central core of what we are discussing. In other words, in an ideal society if an employee feels that his employer may have acted contrary to the Bill—which the agency will decide—he should logically be free to make such an accusation. The employer should either defend it, or if he has committed an offence he should admit it and put it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know, however, that industry is about complicated, detailed, human relationships, and Members who have worked in industry know that there are difficulties, such as the recalcitrant employer and employee who may act irrationally and irresponsibly. The Government feel that there must be protection under this Bill for people to speak freely. If the Bill is to work and this key clause is central to it—it will only work in an open sense. It will only work if people can freely speak their minds and if, when they see an injustice, they can refer it for examination by a totally independent, rational body—not by the defendant or the appellant, but by an independent body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the tenor of what the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) is saying. I am sure that he will agree that defining this legislation in terms that will not be misunderstood is a difficult drafting problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to the three amendments, the Government believe that acceptance of any of them would weaken the provisions of Clause 16. We fell that this freedom from victimisation, with the proper safeguards which it will give to the employer, should go forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I make it clear that these provisions do not, in any event, protect against discrimination a person who makes allegations which are false and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
not made in good faith. This is made clear by subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 98 would remove from Clause 16(3) the protection from victimisation now given to a person who alleges that another has committed an act which is in contravention of the Bill whether or not he has made a complaint to the Fair Employment Agency. Without that safeguard it is possible that a person might not make allegations, however well founded, that an employer, or other, was contravening the Bill for fear that as a result he himself would be discriminated against. The Bill ought not to allow a person who sincerely believes that the law is being broken to be prevented from pursuing the matter. I think that I outlined that point at the beginning of my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) with which the right hon. Gentleman dealt. This paragraph protects a person from victimisation. It does not affect such remedies as the employer would have taken under the general law—namely, action against defamation of character, slander or other common law charges. Therefore, it does not affect the common law in that sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to paragraph (
	<i>d</i>) the right hon. Gentleman asked the pertinent question of the interpretation of the words within the clause. A person could be victimised by his employer because he had appealed to the court under Clause 28 against a finding by the agency. A person could also be discriminated against because he had alleged that the victimiser or a person by whom he had been previously employed had followed practices which failed to provide equality of opportunity. Clearly these and similar cases must be protected, and therefore paragraph (
	<i>d</i>), as worded, is necessary to cover that particular point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 100 would remove the protection from victimisation of a person who had not actually done any of the things listed in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) to (
	<i>c</i>) but whom the victimiser knows intends to do, or suspects has done, or intends to do one of them. The right hon. Gentleman asked for an example relating to paragraph (
	<i>d</i>). An employer who has contravened the Bill would be able to dismiss an employee whom he knows or suspects intends to give evidence to
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
the agency, the courts, or the appeals board. Thus it would be easier for the employer to get round the provisons of the Bill since he would be freer to obstruct the agency, the courts and the board in the discharge of their functions. Obviously that is not a situation which the Bill should permit. It is right that the Bill should protect well-intentioned persons who can and do provide information or take any action in relation to the Bill which helps to achieve its purpose. In its present form Clause 16 does so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have replied in some detail to the amendments moved by the right hon. Gentleman. Clause 16 as it stands is justified to deal with what I recognise is a difficult problem. However, it is one which has to be faced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree that the concept of victimisation must be included in the clause. As the Minister rightly says, an unscrupulous employer could take the opportunity to circumvent what is intended in the Bill by reason of victimisation. That is why we support paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) without query. It is obvious that if an employer took action against an employee, following that employee having taken action under paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>), it could easily be proved that the person was guilty of victimisation and of religious discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, an allegation of victimisation is something with which anyone involved in industry is frequently confronted. It is extremely difficult to prove or disprove. It is something which an unscrupulous employee and his trade union representatives might allege when all other forces of defence have been exhausted; so it can work both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last few lines of the clause present a situation where an employer could be accused of victimisation if he fired me because he thought that I was about to allege something against him. The Minister defends that situation on the basis that he wants to encourage people to speak their minds and he wants them to complain about injustice where it exists. So do the Opposition. We contend that if a person is speaking his mind and is complaining of an injustice, that is probably already covered under paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>). How can it be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
proved that that employer suspected that I was about to do something? What indications would I have given him that I was about to do something? If I had already said something which led him to the conclusion that I was about to make an allegation, would that not also be covered in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>), (
	<i>c</i>) or (
	<i>d</i>)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have difficulty in knowing how an employer could answer the charge laid against him that he has victimised someone because he believed that that person was about to do something. I should like to know what the Minister can suggest that that employer might have discerned in his employee's behaviour which would indicate to the employer that that person was potentially an accuser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contributions of the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of State, as we have proceeded with the Bill, have been welcome to my hon. Friends and myself insofar as they have disclosed the attitude in which he himself approaches the Bill and in which he intends and believes it will be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, he has shown that he realises, at least, at the outset, that the operations will take place against a background of suspicions, a background in which suspicions like the Brocken spectre are very much larger than the reality which causes them. There is a reality, but the penumbra of suspicion around the reality is always very much larger than the reality itself. He has shown the Committee that he realises that if the agency—and in a sense we are briefing the agency by the Bill—goes about the matter the wrong way, it can very well do more harm than good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that light that I appeal to him, after listening carefully to his first reply, to reconsider certainly two and possibly three paragraphs of subsection (3) of the clause. The right hon. Gentleman said that the intention is that people should be able to speak freely. We would say "Amen" to that in Northern Ireland or any other part of the United Kingdom. He went on to qualify that in a way which we would also support. He said that they ought to be able to speak freely and put their suspicions for examination, not by interested parties, but by an impartial body or, eventually, bodies. I submit that that is the correct sense in which this Bill seeks to give people the opportunity
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
freely to express their fears and their beliefs—well or ill-founded, as long as it is in good faith—that discrimination is taking place. Therefore, the provisions of paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) go without saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But referring to paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), if a trade union organiser or a trade unionist or an employee has genuine grounds—see subsection (4)—that an employer is guilty of discrimination, it is his business to take the remedies provided under the Bill. It is not proper for him to go around muttering and saying to people, who are not in the impartial position that the right hon. Gentleman spoke about, "You know so-and-so; I know cases where he discriminated against so-and-so and so-and-so." It is not good enough that we should include within the protection against discrimination which, in principle, is necessary for the functioning of the Bill, a person who is neglecting to use the opportunities and the protection which the machinery of the Act gives. By including paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), certainly in its present generality, it seems to me that we are not, in fact, legislating with an even hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in connection with paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), I should like to put to the right hon. Gentleman that he would probably do better—and this is what I wish him to consider—if he extends the ambit of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>). I think perhaps that this is what he has in mind. I will give an imaginary case. An act of discrimination has been committed, but before the person concerned makes a complaint it becomes known that he is to make a complaint. He may say that he is going to the Board; he may walk off the premises, saying "If that is what you do, if you are refusing me the job, I am going straight to the Agency".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it is beyond the vocabulary of statute law, or the abilities of parliamentary draftsmen, to include in the making of the complaint the—and here I am using informal words—intention or the fact of being about to make a complaint. There must be a number of instances in the law as it exists where protection clearly cannot be afforded only from the spot instant when the complaint is formally made, but is extended to the genuine process of—to put it into popular terms—the going off to make a complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is in mind with paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), my hon Friends and I have no objection, to it, of course. But we say that in the way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
in which paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is drafted the net has been cast too wide and, what is worse, this wide casting of the net could be used to cover practices and behaviour which none of us would wish to encourage. There is undoubtedly much baseless suspicion, which one comes across all the time—for example, in the context of the Housing Executive—felt by constituents one after another in identical circumstances. One is convinced that he was discriminated against as he was a Roman Catholic, the other that he was discriminated against because he was a Protestant. They are both almost certainly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) to be a cover under which that sort of thing is believed to have been given a charter. That is not the sort of speaking freely that the right hon. Gentleman or any of us want. I hope that he may be able to make a helpful response on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to his answer to the specific question attached to paragraph (
	<i>d</i>). He said it referred to subsequent appeals under Clause 28. With great respect, if that is one of the two things which it is intended to cover, it would be better legislation if we made it clear that that is what is involved, because nobody would say that one should be exempt from victimisation if one wanted to complain, but subject to victimisation if one wanted to pursue the complaint to the point of appeal. There is no reason why that could not be set out on the face of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other contingency which the right hon Gentleman mentioned, if I heard him correctly, was that it might be a matter of denial of equality of opportunity under Part II. If the right hon Gentleman means to sustain that, we are in the middle of our old familiar difficulties about the relationship of Parts II and III. Now that we have moved into the sharp end with Part III and are dealing with victimisation in the context of complaints of unlawful discrimination, which is what Parts III and IV are about, we should not, so to speak, hook in the contemplation of matters which would arise only under Part II. Would the right hon Gentleman therefore consider the matter again from that point of view?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the right hon. Gentleman purported to give a concrete instance to illustrate the working of lines 13 to 15 but,
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
in fact, he illustrated a case not of suspicion or intention but of positive action. He went on to say "If an employer is engaging in unlawful discrimination, he faces being brought under the procedures of Parts III and IV, in which case some of his employees may be called upon to give evidence". If I understood the right hon. Gentleman correctly, that would be sufficient ground for imputing to him the suspicion of an intention on the part of those employees to give evidence. I agree freely that, if an employer is guilty of discrimination and knows it, he is very likely to be confronted with a complaint and to have evidence produced by his employees under the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friends and I query is whether one is justified by a kind of Morton's Fork in viewing that retrospectively, as it were, and saying "As you knew you were guilty of discrimination, you must have known or suspected that your employees intended to give evidence or make a complaint, and therefore every action you take ought not only to be scrutinised in the light of the other provisions of the Bill but, in addition, you should be caught under this derivative offence of discrimination based upon your suspicion that someone intended to allege".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman recognises that these are genuine anxieties, and that a Committee exists in order to clear up exactly this kind of point before legislation goes on to the statute book. Can he look again to see whether, perhaps by an extension of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), in regard to contemplating making a complaint, protection can be afforded without arousing the undoubted objections which, in their present wide ambit, the words to which the amendment relates raise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background of the right hon. Gentleman's general attitude, I appeal to him to come along with us to the extent of recognising our anxieties—we recognise his problems—and seeing whether something can be done in co-operation with his advisers and draftsmen to meet them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I looked at this matter in some detail with my advisers before coming to the Committee. I examined the wording to which the right hon. Gentleman drew attention, because I did not want it to go beyond the scope with which plainly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
it has to deal, namely, the central matters of victimisation. The sort of case which the right hon. Gentleman made is similar to those in our mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employee, for instance, may feel that there had been a violation of the Bill's provisions. He may be a chap who has no experience of raising matters. He does not know how to go about it or where the Agency is, so he may say to his shop steward "We have the Fair Employment Act, and I believe that it has been violated". The Bill's provisions cover no more than that situation. They are to ensure that that person could not be victimised, in a sense, for stating a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had consultations about the wording in paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), raised by the right hon. Gentleman, and I agree that it is an important point. I am advised that the type of amendment suggested by the right hon. Gentleman would not meet the case. The words used are found in identical form in two Acts which are old friends of the right hon. Gentleman, namely, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Race Relations Act. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman realises that he has read the words before. I do not believe that the existing words would have the undesirable effect that he claimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If remarks were made that an employer felt to be completely unjustified, he would not be free to victimise the person who made them, but he could use the law of defamation and take action against that person in the normal process of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (4) surely covers such a case anyway, without recourse to other enactments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to make clear that I believe that we need the paragraphs as they stand, to cover eventualities. I am trying to explain, as I was asked—and I accept that the question was valid—the intention of the words and their application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman challenged me when he referred to appeals in Clause 28. That was given purely as an example of other matters covered, such as settling a complaint under Clause 25. I am advised that other matters are covered as well. The final words in the subsection prevent the employer victimising an employee by his getting in first and dismissing him
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
before the employee can make the complaint. To remove that provision would leave a large loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered all the comments made by the right hon. Gentleman. For the reasons I have given I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess to a degree of disappointment, because the definition which the right hon. Gentleman gave at the outset of his reply, concerning his objectives, was one which we heartily accept. He spoke of a man saying to a shop steward "Look, I must do something about this. I am sure that I am being victimised. How do I go about it?" Obviously that should be covered, and no doubt there are ways and means of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was, however, a little thrown by the right hon. Gentleman's concluding remarks. If an employer who discriminates against an employee in, for example, the matter of promotion, goes on actually to sack that employee, not only is the ground of action under the Bill on the previous unlawful action not thereby affected, but it is likely that the complainant will have another ground for action. He will not need to seek the cover of the victimisation provisions. He will have an even more cast-iron case for the proceedings, eventual compensation and so on, under the subsequent provisions of the Bill. Surely the right hon. Gentleman does not seriously feel that that is the kind of case for which we need the armoury of lines 13 to 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the right hon. Gentleman advanced or retarded matters by referring to the precedents. Without examining whether he advanced or retarded them, I am sure that he would agree that in enacting this legislation, we are, as the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) constantly reminds us, looking at conditions as they are in Northern Ireland. Otherwise, we may as well have a United Kingdom statute. Therefore, though I give the right hon. Gentleman the value of precedents, he must still face the effect in the circumstances of Northern Ireland of the relationships, atmosphere of suspicions and so on, of even those very provisions which aroused our anxieties, incomprehension and mystification when we were reading and studying this Bill in the anaesthetised atmosphere of Mem-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
bers of Parliament looking at proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand that drafting, done on one's feet in Committee has a thousand to one chances against it. I am not trying to do that, but I am putting to the right hon. Gentleman what I think is his intention, and I ask him, for the purposes of the Bill, to achieve it more precisely and narrowly. He wants to protect not only the making of a complaint and the giving of evidence, but steps taken in contemplation of doing so. Whether or not those words are apt enough to go straight into this clause, they express the mischief with which the right hon. Gentleman is trying to deal. He wants to ensure that where people contemplate availing themselves of the protection and the machinery of the Bill, as much protection is given to them against victimisation as if they actually got to the point of formally taking those steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman can indicate that it is his intention to cover steps taken in contemplation—and as laymen, we all understand what is meant by making use of the provisions of the Bill—and will see whether this Northern Ireland Bill—and it is a Northern Ireland Bill—can say that on the face of it, we shall be happy to part with these amendments and look forward to the next stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) spoke of an "anaesthetised atmosphere". There is an anaesthetised atmosphere, speaking climatically, in this room. I wonder whether it would be possible to reduce the sub-tropicality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall see what can be done about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to amplify my intervention in the remarks of my right hon. Friend. I first became interested in the affairs of Northern Ireland as a civil liberties issue. I am aware of the kind of dangers that the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) is constantly pointing out—namely, that in trying to secure the freedoms and equalities of some individuals one might trespass upon the liberties of others. Therefore, I am concerned to be satisfied that the provisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
within the Bill do not restrict the liberties of others. In my intervention I was pointing out that I thought that my right hon. Friend had calculated pretty well, and in subsection (4) one had the provision which would deal with the situation in which an employee was maliciously and malevolently making allegations. Clearly, it would have been unsatisfactory if somebody making false allegations, without reasonable grounds, could not be dismissed by an employer for such conduct. Therefore, it seems to me that the kind of balance that the right hon. Member for Down, South is seeking is provided in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, I think, another safeguard. I do not know whether my right hon. Friend will comment upon this now or at a later stage of the Bill. But I understand in his reply to an earlier interjection that he would at some stage deal more thoroughly with the lack of opportunity for private prosecution under this legislation. As I understand it, an agency has been established and the powers within the clause are back-up powers for that agency. One would, therefore, hope that the agency can achieve its objectives without having to use those powers. Therefore, I think that I am right in believing that one ought to see these provisions against the background of an agency only using the powers where it feels that it has no alternative, applying the provisions of this measure with common sense, and seeking itself to establish the kind of balance between two sets of balances, which it seems that my right hon. Friend has already done his best to achieve in drafting the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill creates no criminal offences as such. Therefore, there can be no prosecutions and actions can be brought only by the agency itself. In a sense that is a safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke about the protection of the liberty of the individual in relation to the clauses and amendments with which we are dealing. We want to get it right that the freedom for the individual, whether it be an employer or employee, should be protected. But there must be a freedom also for the individual to operate the law as it will exist when the Bill becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman is asking me whether or not the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
recognise that the outline which he gave was basically what we are trying to achieve in the Bill, I can answer that in the affirmative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment, because I am advised that the wording is unnecessary. It is not meant to catch other than the type of cases and the type of protection about which we have been speaking. It is certainly no wider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can help the right hon. Gentleman by giving the interpretation for which he asked of what the Government want to see. We want to achieve an atmosphere in which these clauses will not have to be used very often, but they will be there if necessary. If an employee makes an objection which is ill-founded, I am sure that someone, perhaps from within his own trade union, will say that he should refer it to the agency or retract it. If he makes an attack upon the employer which comes within the normal defamation laws, the employer can be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The type of atmosphere I wish to create is one in which people cannot be victimised because they are going to proceed perhaps at some future date, and they are therefore free at this time to say "Look, I feel an injustice has been created".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man might not know what is happening in a department within the firm in which he is not employed. Let us assume that he is a Protestant, and a Protestant applies for a job in that small department where the other workers are all Roman Catholics. The Protestant is then refused the job. He might say "That is victimisation because a Protestant has been refused a job". He might not know that that person has not the qualifications or is not the right type of person for that job. However, at that time he might feel that it is a justifiable complaint. A sensible employer would explain to that man, when he hears that the man has made the allegation, that the complaint is ill-founded. But an employer who was not sensible might dismiss him because he has made such a remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we are venturing on to the next amendment, and I want to keep off it, but that is the sort of situation we envisage. I give that as an example of the intention of paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>), (
	<i>c</i>) and (
	<i>d</i>). I hope that on that basis, the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I are anxious to make progress. We recognise that the Minister's definition of this intention is not only acceptable to the Committee, but is in line with what we would wish. Nevertheless, this matter is so important against the Northern Ireland background that there should be a further opportunity, if possible, for the view of the House to be taken upon the wording of the clause. Therefore, I ask you to put the Question, Mrs. Jeger. No doubt, it will be negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 41 in page 13, line 18, at end insert 'or without reasonable grounds'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
We on this bench found ourselves very much in agreement with the way in which the right hon. Gentleman explained the purposes of subsection (3). We also agree with the purposes of subsection (4) as they stand, but this is to protect the employer against false allegations of victimisation or those made not in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those words usually imply some degree of malice on the part of the person making the complaint. Our concern in putting down this amendment—and we shall carefully consider what the right hon. Gentleman has to say, in deciding whether to press the amendment—is to consider the position where a complaint is made under a misapprehension, not with malice but not on reasonable grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested when, in an intervention, the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham), regarding subsection (3), used the expression "without reasonable grounds". I have always been a little disturbed, when studying Acts of Parliament, by the expression "not in good faith". It is difficult to define, and implies some degree of malice. We are here this morning, to a certain extent, briefing the agency on how to act when dealing with these complaints. The purpose of the amendment is to give a wider opportunity to the agency to judge whether a complaint is justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, a complaint could be made mistakenly, and I think that these words would help to find an amicable solution for the agency and the parties concerned. On the other hand, complaints might be deliberately false, in which case subsection (4) would cover that point, as the hon. Member for Paddington pointed out. It might be that complaints and suspicions are frivolous. This point has arisen with regard to the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act, where the wording, I believe, is similar to subsection (4). I believe that the Community Relations Commission has recently pointed out that there is not enough protection against frivolous accusations, where they are frivolous, but made, to some degree, without malice, and where the suspicion is not on reasonable grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection seems, therefore, to refer to a deliberate act of making false allegations, or made not in good faith, and not to where the allegation arises from mis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
judgment of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with the Minister that people must be permitted to speak freely and that there should be proper safeguards for the employee. There should equally be proper safeguards for the employer, not only against false accusations or those made in good faith, but against accusations not made on reasonable grounds. Those are rather wide words, but they are put in the amendment to enable the Agency to judge the merits of the particular accusation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like some assurances from the Minister of State that he has those words in mind in regard to subsection (4), and we shall then consider whether to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand exactly what the hon. Gentleman is getting at, in trying to protect against the frivolous complaint. This happens perhaps when legislation first comes into operation. There has been experience of this in the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. I am convinced, however, that like any other Act, when people become aware of its provisions and become used to its operation, that type of frivolity will cease. I do not believe that people will be very frivolous about this issue in Northern Ireland. It is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an allegation were frivolous, Clause 24 would take care of that, and the Agency could dismiss it without even an investigation. I suggest that that clears the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words that the hon. Gentleman suggests should be inserted, "or without reasonable grounds", appear to be reasonable on the face of it. The term "good faith" implies that the individual made his allegations believing them to be true. The amendment would enable a person to victimise another on the basis of an allegation which, though made quite honestly, happened to have no reasonable justification. It would substitute, therefore, an objective for the present subjective test. The amendment would thus tend to discourage people with a grievance which they believed to be genuine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the illustration I gave, of the person working in another part of a factory which by coincidence employs people predominantly of one community, in which perhaps a person belonging to the same community as the complainant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
applies for the job and does not get it, would give the idea that discrimination had been used. This sort of thing happens with the Race Relations Act. People apply for jobs and it may seem that choice or rejection is based on the race or colour of the applicants, which on investigation may turn out not to be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, a person might make an allegation in good faith, which was not based on a sound foundation. That is the issue. The Government consider that it would weaken the Bill to put in the proposed words. I urge the hon. Gentleman to accept that the Government want to go no wider than the terms that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the Minister's explanation, because there was a temptation to support the amendment. I was not thinking so much of the frivolous allegation aspect. I was thinking about the more serious case in which an employer in, let us say, a rundown situation, has a difficult choice to make between two people of differing religious viewpoints, as to who he lays off. No matter what choice he makes, it is natural for the person who has lost his job to be genuinely convinced that he has been discriminated against. He rationalises the matter and sees it as a choice between two religious groupings, with the employer picking out one group. That allegation should not be construed as a false allegation, if the man sincerely believes it to be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same situation could apply in the promotional aspect. An employer might have two good men, almost on a par. He must make the difficult choice of whom to make foreman or chargehand. The person who does not get the job, without making a false allegation, may in good faith be convinced that he is the right man for the job. He then says that he has been victimised and discriminated against. We felt that the insertion of the words "or without reasonable grounds" might protect an employer in that situation. However, the Minister's explanation clarified the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) that if we were to add the words to the Bill, which influenced our first inclination to support the proposal, we should be saying
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
that it would be all right to victimise a man for being unreasonable. There is so much unreason in the world that we should never be out of proceedings if that were the effect of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervene only to comment that even this amendment, and the brief debate we have had on it, illustrates the special context given to the legislation by the kind of suspicion existing in Northern Ireland. I repeat what I have said before to the Committee, that a high proportion of the convinced allegations of discrimination, certainly those which come to me as a Member of Parliament, are from my point of view unreasonable. Therefore, we have this feeling of anxiety about the making of such allegations, even in good faith, being brought into this anti-discrimination clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impulse of the official Opposition to move the amendment, and the brief debate we have had, further strengthens the appeal which I know that the Minister has noted, to consider whether our common object can be achieved with less peripheral fuzziness and risk during the subsequent stages of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were impressed by the Minister's explanation. Will not the right hon. Gentleman agree that the word "frivolous" in legal terms was correctly defined by him as meaning without a sound foundation? That is the basis on which I should use the word "frivolous", not as "lighthearted" or in more global terms. In view of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, however, the Opposition are satisfied and we shall not press the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry perhaps to spoil once again the atmosphere which we have managed to engender in the Committee today, which is comparable to the atmosphere which prevailed two weeks ago. I do not want to re-open the debate on the amendment, but I want to revert to a matter which still concerns my hon. Friends and myself. Other legislation has been mentioned. I have sat on other Committees, and what impressed me in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
those early days was that the Government were always eager to give examples of what they meant and what the legislation was trying to cover, and to make it easier for people like me to understand the implication of their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been difficult to draw the Government representatives in this Committee to do that. They may be somewhat afraid of getting into deep water, into difficult areas of argument, and so on. Therefore, they have totally avoided answering many of our questions. I understand that. But this attitude has become almost obsessive. We have asked the question on a number of occasions, and it arises again in the clause. What does "political opinion" mean? Does the use of discrimination on the grounds of "religious belief or political opinion" introduce protection for a member of the Provisional Sinn Fein? I simply want to ask the Minister to give us clarification on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that membership of the Provisional Sinn Fein is perhaps enough to have a person excluded from Great Britain. The discussion over the past two sittings appears to indicate that membership of the Provisional Sinn Fein might mean that a person seeking employment in the kitchen in this House might not get the job. He would be refused employment on the basis that he was a member of the Provisional Sinn Fein. If Seamus Loughran, for example who, as I said earlier, described the attack on Aldergrove Airport as an imaginative scheme of the Provisional IRA, were to apply for a job at that airport and was refused it, could the airport management be accused of religious or political discrimination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although I was unfortunately not present at the previous Committee meeting, I have read the record carefully. I suggest that we would be getting dangerously near repetitious argument if we debated this matter again. I hope that the Minister will not feel it necessary to enlarge on what was debated last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In dealing with this clause, which seeks to define unlawful discrimination, I think that we have discovered a serious lack of adequate and additional wording to make clear the Government's intention. There is little doubt that the two problems of discrimina-
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
tion on religious and political grounds are inextricably bound. We are saying that, while that may be the case in some situations the Government will run into great difficulties when trying to apply this measure because of the lack of adequate and additional wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Minister to face reality. In trying to deal with what he calls a loophole, he will find that he cannot keep out of employment persons who intend to disrupt the economy and destroy the State. We ask him to address his mind to dealing with what he calls a loophole, because he is, in fact, creating a monster, the potential of which I do not think he appreciates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for more than a minute or two, but this is, after all, the pivotal clause of the Bill. Virtually everything else that follows takes its rise from this definition and assertion. Compared with Part II, it is, to use the expression again, the business end or sharp point of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You are not the only one, Mrs. Jeger, who has reflected in the last 48 hours upon what transpired during the wide-ranging debate on the first amendment to this clause. I am not intentionally putting words into the Minister's mouth which he would disavow. Indeed, I am trying to follow the argument as accurately as possible. The Minister would no doubt say "We have here a Bill which is going to be administered by public authorities where prosecutions"—I am probably using the wrong word—"are to be subject to public authorisation. Moreover, as Minister, I am making clear the light in which this legislation is regarded". I do not believe that argument would stand if it were pleaded in a court of law. "Therefore, although the extension of this clause to cover political opinion is in terms unlimited, it will, in practice, nearly always be limited to what we know without being able very easily to define it—namely, political discrimination, which is really religious discrimination or so closely allied to it as to be inseparable. Nevertheless", he would continue and conclude, "I am not going to rule out altogether political discrimination as a substantive and separate ground".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have hit off there the broad approach of the right hon. Gentleman. I would have wished it to be more restric-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
tive, but I accept it for the purpose of the one argument that I wish to put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the definition in Clause 57, we find that political opinion includes supposed political opinion and the absence of political opinion. I will not dilate upon some absurdities which might be implicit in discrimination between persons on the ground that one did and other did not have a political opinion. I am tempted to dislike Laodiceans, and perhaps emotionally would be disposed to discriminate against a Laodicean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there was, I would have been against it. But difficulty arises over this question of definition, and this is the right time—before we come to the definition clause—to ventilate it. Again, there is a difference between the background in Northern Ireland and that in Great Britain. If this were a Great Britain Bill, we would not be arguing the definition and ambit of political opinion—I really think we would be unsurprised at a Bill which did not seek to define it—but in Northern Ireland there is this real difficulty, and I put it to the right hon. Gentleman that just as there are para-military organisations, which are neither military nor civilian by definition, so there are para-political organisations and opinions, to which there is nothing that corresponds in the circumstances of Great Britain, happily at present. I can think of days gone by when there might have been. But they exist in Northern Ireland and the right hon. Gentleman and everyone knows what I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I find it offensive to regard membership of the UDA as implying the holding of a political opinion. I think it belongs to a different category from the holding of political opinions in the natural United Kingdom sense of the term. The right hon. Gentleman's clause and definition involve him in real difficulties of interpretation and of attitude towards this legislation because of the special circumstances existing in Ulster. I put this now to the right hon. Gentleman in order that his mind, like that of the

Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has thanked the Government for the detailed manner in which they have examined the matter and met the arguments. It will not do for the hon. Gentleman to make sloganising remarks when we are discussing a serious Bill which we hope will go some way towards eliminating one of the social evils existing in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the definition of political discrimination at the last sitting we used the terms UDA, Sinn Fein and so on purely in the context of the law as it stands at present in this country, as defined by the House of Commons. But the hon. Gentleman twisted them and took them out of context. The right hon. Gentleman for Down, South (Mr. Powell) spoke about the para-military organisations. I think that what he said did more than anything else to refute what the hon. Members for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) and Armagh Mr. McCusker) had to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of political definition and people who are involved in violence. A person who initiates or advocates violence by statement or action will not be covered by the Bill and can be discriminated against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will be covered by the Bill are lawful organisations. It does not matter whether a person is a member of the Protestant community or the Roman Catholic community. That will be the basis, and I hope, therefore, that we can now make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mrs. Jeger, but as the right hon. Gentleman—and it is all in the day's work—sought to suggest that I was at odds with my hon. Friends, may I say that if there had been

	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
any difference between us his concluding words not only brought us together, but brought us together with the Minister. There are organisations in Northern Ireland which are lawful of which the members may be heard advocating violence—albeit hypothetically and conditionally. This is common experience. We have had a most important statement and definition from the right hon. Gentleman. He has said to the Committee, with his authority as a Minister, that the holding of opinions which include or advocate the search for political objectives by unlawful means, even though the organisation or the label is not unlawful, cannot be sheltered under the phrase "political opinion" in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must get this point absolutely clear. What I said was that a person—whether or not he is a member of an organisation to which we have referred—who advocates or takes part in violence toward another person and condones violence as a means of resolving the problem in Northern Ireland will not be protected under the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most important statement. It has justified anything that my hon Friend said to have elicited that statement. We have in the Bill a most important definition of the limits of political opinion. I give notice that we shall see—since the right hon. Gentleman knows that he cannot be quoted in the interpretation—whether this can be enshrined at some later stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to make this point clear to the right hon Gentleman and to the Committee. I do not need to put in this 
	<i>caveat</i> but it is, perhaps, important to do so. What I said about violence and the people who partake in it, whether or not they are members of organisations, is absolutely clear. One could have a member of a legal organisation who has never believed, advocated or taken part in violence and such a person would be protected by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the last clause the difficulty with Amendment No. 101 is that because of unnecessary wording we again create a loophole. I pose the possibility that if we retained the wording which we seek to omit in relation to employment in Northern Ireland we create a rather intriguing possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that an employer outside Northern Ireland came to the Province and tried to take on some employees, not to work in the Province but in another part of the United Kingdom. He would not be at all limited and confined by the legislation. This is not just a hypothetical situation. It is a real possibility. Let us suppose that within the shipbuilding industry someone from the mainland was to go to Northern Ireland and try to employ some boilermakers. He would not have to adhere to this legislation even if he was importing those people back to the mainland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another possibility. We have national companies in Northern Ireland, and it is possible that an opportunity for promotion could arise in one of those companies which involved the person so promoted moving from the Province. The equality of opportunity for this promotion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
need not obtain because the wording of Clause 17 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to employment in Northern Ireland"</p></blockquote>
Therefore, there is a loophole which is created by the presence of unnecessary wording. We would not lose any of the safeguards implicit in the clause by omitting the words to which the amendment refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite explicit to move from the wording of Clause 17 which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person…"</p></blockquote>
to
	<br><blockquote><p>"…where that person is seeking employment"</p></blockquote>
That is quite a natural movement. The meaning, the significance and the degree of protection is in no way lessened by omitting the words to which this amendment refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To help the hon. Gentleman I would like to say that the points that he has raised in his argument are ones with which we agree. The basis of his argument was that we could not extend the legislation to operations outside of Northern Ireland. This, of course, is the whole intention of the Bill. The Bill is concerned only with employments and occupations in Northern Ireland. It applies whether the employer is based in Northern Ireland or outside, to the extent that he is operating in Northern Ireland. If the Bill did not apply to multi-national companies with head offices outside Northern Ireland, it would be considerably weakened. What the Bill applies to, in effect, is the operation of companies within the confines of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the argument put forward by the hon. Gentleman about people recruiting employees for work outside of Northern Ireland is not within the scope of the Bill. But employers within various organisations recruiting people to work in Northern Ireland would be covered by the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost deprived of breath by the reply of the Under-Secretary. I shall let the Committee into a secret. I expected that there would be a clause or subsection somewhere in the Bill, which we had not discovered, dealing with
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) and that with a triumphant flourish, the Under-Secretary—not without a little assistance—would refer us to a sub-paragraph of a paragraph of a subsection of a clause. Not a bit of it. He says "That is all right. Discrimination on religious grounds is perfectly all right on the streets of Belfast or Newry, provided that the person who recruits or"—and he did not apparently deny this—"the person who decides whom to promote, is concerned with employment in Great Britain." I wonder whether that will not be regarded as a fancy, especially in present economic circumstances. In a debate in the House on Monday, we were told that there would be opportunities in Plymouth for those unemployed in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be told that those who recruit for employment in the rest of the United Kingdom from areas of high unemployment in Northern Ireland can discriminate as they please and can go round saying, "We are only taking on Roman Catholics for a new plastics factory in Merton and Morden", makes me wonder whether we know what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parallel has previously been mentioned in this debate, which I would not recommend to the Committee unless I knew that it has considerable leverage with the Government, of the Race Relations Act. For work in France, or even for work in China, it is unlawful to discriminate on grounds of race among those one recruits or tries to recruit in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no justification for us to permit deliberate discrimination to be exercised in Northern Ireland—and I shall come to that point shortly—provided that the people concerned will be carted off and employed in a factory elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman says, "Ah, but this is a Bill about Northern Ireland". So it is, but it is not a Bill about employment in Northern Ireland. It is a Bill about discrimination in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fair employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I leave it to the Minister then, to get up and say to the House and to the Committee "You have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
mistaken all this time. You thought this was a Bill to prevent discrimination in the context of employment—not in other contexts—but we are concentrating on the most important worrying context of employment to eliminate religious discrimination. You are wrong".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, when acts are made unlawful, we add them to the Bill as we are doing at present. We are adding to the Bill the clause which makes acts of discrimination unlawful. When one legislates to make an act unlawful, it is an act within the area of jurisdiction, or within the area of the ambit of the Bill. Therefore, the logic of the hon. Member's case is that since the Bill concerns Northern Ireland, it should be acts of discrimination in Northern Ireland—in the context of employment, of course, but in the context of employment anywhere—which should be outlawed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not be difficult for the hon. Member to envisage the friction which can arise if, as my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South said about promotion, firms operating all over the United Kingdom which do not happen to have a specific office, within the terms of the Bill, in Northern Ireland, exercise discrimination, provided that the job in question is a job elsewhere in the United Kingdom, or for that matter, a job elsewhere other than in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Member say that if, in Great Britain, we made it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of religion, we would say that it is perfectly all right if the people concerned—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]—Does the Under-Secretary wish to intervene? The proceedings might have been shortened if he had given a more effective reply to my hon Friend in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we legislate, for example, as we do against racial discrimination, we do not draw a boundary around the area where the effect of that legislation is to be felt. We say that if the act takes place in the jurisdiction of the Bill it is unlawful, and as the jurisdiction—to use an unofficial phrase—of this Bill is Northern Ireland, let us face the consequences of our policy and say that when discrimination on religious grounds for purposes of employment is perpetrated in Northern Ireland, it shall be within the mischief of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) was in the Committee throughout our brief discussion on this amendment, or whether he is
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
aware that the Bill permits religious discrimination provided that it is in the recruitment of persons to be employed in Great Britain. That has been confirmed. I also wonder whether it would have his approval or whether he would think that it is right that with rising unemployment in Northern Ireland, about which both he and we are concerned, employment opportunities in the rest of the United Kingdom should be distributed on a candidly discriminatory basis about which nobody can do anything. I am sorry that the hon. Member was not present, and I realise that one cannot be all the time, but it concerns him as much as it concerns us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we get a more satisfactory explanation or assurance for the future, I hope that he will join us in pressing this upon the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on this clause, but I do not accept—even though, in my absence, I did not hear the words that were mentioned—that this Bill permits discrimination in employment on religious grounds in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It says it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a play on words. The Bill is intended to relate to Northern Ireland where there has been a history of religious discrimination by one section of the community against another. That has happened in the past. There were the Gordon Riots in Britain for which we know the reason, and there has also been the issue which has arisen in Liverpool in the past. Fortunately for Britain, however, those days have gone. In Northern Ireland, however, we still have that problem. I do not believe—at least I sincerely hope that it is not the case—that any employer in Great Britain would discriminate on the grounds of religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) is more realistic when it comes to interpreting the Bill. I know that there have been attempts by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) to try to equate the situation in Northern Ireland, and to question the validity of the term "political opinion". He has suggested that people have been discriminated against on grounds of political allegiance in Britain. He says that on one amendment, and the next minute, as he did on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
the last amendment, he referred to me as always speaking about the realities, and this must be taken within the Northern Ireland context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Armagh described an imaginary case of two or three employees being scheduled for promotion where there was only one vacancy, and a Catholic feeling discriminated against because he did not get the promotion. It might have happened to a Protestant. This is realism in terms of Northern Ireland. What the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) said in discussions on earlier parts of the Bill, and what he says now is that there can be discrimination between Methodists, members of the Church of Ireland, Presbyterians, Free Presbyterians, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is going a little far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to say that the hon. Member for Armagh knows very well the reason and intention behind the Bill. It is to prevent discrimination in Northern Ireland between the majority Protestant population and the Catholics. There is no problem of discrimination between Protestants and Catholics in Britain, and therefore it is unnecessary to apply the provisions of the Bill there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) spoke of "things as they are in Northern Ireland". He has only to look at the Long Title of the Bill to know that his arguments, and those of his hon. Friends, are absolutely drowned. The Long Title states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An Act to establish an Agency with the duties of promoting equality of opportunity in employments and occupations in Northern Ireland".</p></blockquote>
I emphasise that it relates only to employment and occupations in Northern Ireland. For hon. Members to construe from that that I am in favour of religious discrimination in Great Britain is taking things too far. They must accept that the Bill in every way relates only to employment and occupations within Northern Ireland itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were not making any accusations against the hon. Gentleman. We are not discussing hypothetical situations. In the morning and evening
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
newspapers in Northern Ireland one can see shipyards in Canada, in Scotland and in England advertising for tradesmen. I have seen advertisements for management positions in factories in the textile industry, particularly in Scotland. People look at the unemployment situation in Northern Ireland and say "Now is the time for us to get in and capture some of the expertise which they have, for which there is no opportunity in Northern Ireland but which we could use in our factory here".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the clause could mean that a Scottish Orangeman could come to Belfast to recruit people for employment in Scotland and employ only Protestants. The advertisements might say "Only Protestants need apply". The aggrieved Catholics would have no protection under the Bill. If that were not the case, the Opposition would be happy, but it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member, with his greater experience of Northern Ireland than mine, give us some examples of where the Scottish Orangemen would reach the bigotry of the Northern Ireland Orangemen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not need to give examples. The hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) gave such graphic examples of the bigotry in the West of Scotland that the Bill should be applied to the West of Scotland as well as Northern Ireland. His hon. Friend spoke of the horrendously illicit way in which discrimination was practised in the rest of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are saying is that it is wrong for someone to discriminate in recruitment in Northern Ireland on religious grounds—full stop—whether the opportunity for employment is provided in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Canada or elsewhere. It is wrong to say that because it does not apply in the other places they will not discriminate anyway. That patently is not the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are continually trying to recruit in the Northern Ireland market for vacancies all over the world. That recruitment should be operated under exactly the same law as applies to every other person recruiting in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the much more sinister example is the one about promotion prospects. We know that some 300 firms have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
attracted to Northern Ireland since the war. Many of them have their headquarters or other factories in Great Britain and throughout the world. I know of many individuals who have had opportunities of promotion from Northern Ireland to those other locations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could well be—we must believe it if we are to accept the case put forward by the Government that there are personnel managers in Northern Ireland who discriminate deliberately in favour of a Protestant, giving him a promotional opportunity which would take him to headquarters or an influential place in the company. We are saying that if they can do that, it should be covered by the Bill, irrespective of where the person will be employed or moved to on a promotional basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Caesar is back in the Committee, I appeal unto Caesar. I do not really think that the right hon. Gentleman can wish the Bill to leave as lawful such practices as, with these words, could happen under it. It has apparently been confirmed that they could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill as we understand it, notwithstanding Clause 33, one could have a discriminatory advertisement for jobs in the shipyards in the North-East of England. There is nothing to prevent such an advertisement appearing in the 
	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> or the 
	<i>Belfast Newsletter.</i> Is it right that when we are passing this legislation we should allow that to happen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary appeals to the Long Title. I can read the Long Title two ways. It can be read as
	<br><blockquote><p>"equality of opportunity in employments and occupations in Northern Ireland between people of different religious beliefs".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, my hon. Friends and I, in all good faith and with reasonable grounds—as has been said already this morning—thought that was what it meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment had been outside the scope of the Bill, you would not have selected it, Mrs. Jeger, so the amendment is within the scope of the Bill and the Government are not inhibited by the Long Title from accepting it. It is therefore no good for the hon. Gentleman, on discovering the absurd consequences of his Bill as drafted—the offensive consequences; the offensive discrimination which it specifically permits—to hold up
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
the Bill, tap the Long Title with his finger, and say "It is in the Long Title. We cannot argue about it now".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a fine way to pass legislation in this House. It would greatly simplify our proceedings, but I do not know that it would be to the general satisfaction. The Government could have a nice fat Long Title, perhaps running over a couple of pages. I see that that is attractive to the Whip. I hope that I am not putting wicked thoughts into areas where I would not wish them to take root and flourish. Then when people propose reasonable amendments such as the one proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) the Government could say "We won't listen to you. Haven't you read the Long Title?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the Long Title means, we wish to put on record that above all, in the present situation of unemployment in Northern Ireland, we regard it as intolerable that discrimination should be lawful in respect of employment in the rest of the United Kingdom, even when that discrimination is carried out in open daylight on the streets of Belfast or Newry. That is an absurdity and not to be tolerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I accept that as this is a Northern Ireland Bill, it is the unlawful acts committed in Northern Ireland upon which it ought to bite, but the unlawful act is the act of discrimination when a person seeks employment. The unlawful act is indeed limited by this limitation which we are seeking to remove, by the 
	<i>locus delicti</i>—the place of the offence—is Northern Ireland whether or not the employment is in the rest of the United Kingdom or is in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman, very understandably, was not with us for a few moments—and I am making no complaint—when this topic was initiated. But I cannot believe that he will set his face rigidly in favour, so to speak, of the Long Title. I ask him not to be a Long Title Minister, but to be an anti-discrimination Minister, which is the object of the exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are serious difficulties in this amendment, if there are practical, insurmountable obstacles to rendering unlawful discriminate advertisements in Northern Ireland for employment in Great Britain, I am sure, that the Committee would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
interested to hear what they are. But as far as I understand it, there is power under the Bill for people from Great Britain to give evidence in Northern Ireland in cases which are brought under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am at a loss to understand the difficulties which reconciled the right hon. Gentleman—and he must have been reluctant—to this limitation. They must be such, otherwise so reasonable a person could not possibly wish discrimination and non-discrimination to exist side by side in Northern Ireland as a result of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a number of years, as many Members including myself, remember, whenever legislation was enacted, there was always a clause at the end of the Bill which said that the legislation would not apply to Northern Ireland. There were occasions when I took serious objections to the non-inclusion of Northern Ireland in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) is trying to turn the wheel full circle and to add a clause to say that this Bill shall apply to the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what he is trying to do. Fortunately for people within the United Kingdom, it is unnecessary to apply that type of legislation. The right hon. Gentleman is very good at drawing imaginary cases, whereby someone in the North-East of England would insert an advertisement in the 
	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> or the 
	<i>Belfast Newsletter,</i> taking on employees with the proviso that they should be Protestants. It is interesting that the right hon. Gentleman did not include the 
	<i>Irish News.</i> Perhaps he thinks that the 
	<i>Irish News,</i> which is a local newspaper, would not carry such an advertisement. I can tell him that this paper would be delighted to carry such an advertisement, as it would prove the necessity for this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is again trying to equate conditions in Great Britain with those in Northern Ireland. Conditions in Northern Ireland are sufficient reason for this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to obstruct the Committee, but it is important to underwrite the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) that, first, the discriminatory judgment by a prospective employer is not only made in Northern Ireland but is made on the basis of the relationship between religion and politics in Northern Ireland. We cannot, therefore, escape from that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the crass reality of a discriminatory judgment is that someone, because of his political or religious affiliations, will not have a job. That cannot be evaded. He will remain in Northern Ireland, without employment, simply because a judgment had been made on the basis of his religion or his politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the world of banking and insurance, where there is a tremendous amount of to-ing and fro-ing between the mainland and Northern Ireland. Judgments will be made by those whose responsibility it is to make those judgments. Again, whether we like it or not, the Roman Catholic community in Northern Ireland is generally associated with those who cause bombing and destruction, as the IRA are traditionally Roman Catholics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately we have seen in the Committee one reason why this legislation has to apply to Northern Ireland. The test of legislation is what sort of mischief it seeks to remedy. In this instance it seems to remedy the mischief of discrimination in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been disappointed by the fact that the Northern Ireland Members, whose feelings have erupted from time to time in the debate, have not provided evidence of the type of discrimination that they claim would be dealt with by the inclusion of their amendments.

	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
It says in the body of the advertisement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Approbation should possess the Certificate of Appropriation from the Roman Catholic Church."</p></blockquote>
What we are saying is that we do not want discrimination to take place in Northern Ireland on religious grounds, irrespective of the situation, if recruitment is being done in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. As a former school manager I well know that Roman Catholic schools in this country operate in a distinct and separate manner, and frequently advertise for people of a particular religion because they have that degree of separation in order to participate in religious activities, which is a proper and right thing to do. So do Methodist schools in some instances and other Protestant schools.

The Bill applies to Northern Ireland, and that is the mischief we seek to remedy now. If there is substantial evidence of the sort of discrimination that the right hon.

	<p>schools in Great Britain. I am glad that it does.</p>

	<p>The hon. Member for Keighley has brought out the fact that it is a real case that we are arguing. Of course, it is more overt in the case of recruitment for schools and it will not be, in the initial stages, in that context unlawful under the Bill where the schools are in Northern Ireland. But we are dealing with the mischief of discrimination where it bears upon employment, and I ask the hon. Member and the Committee to face the anomaly which will be created, when people are recruited from the consistuency of my hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) and others to jobs in the same trades in Great Britain if in those cases all the Bill's provisions are inapplicable.</p>

	<p>I beg the right hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to clarify a point. If he has read the records of parliamentary debates he will be aware that dissatisfaction has long been expressed about the activities or non-activities of certain people employed in local employment exchanges throughout Northern Ireland, particularly in Belfast. I assume that it is the practice in all parts of the United Kingdom to have a section within the employment exchange to deal specifically with referring people to employment. It is known in Northern Ireland as the placing section. This is the section of the local exchange where a prospective employer would inquire whether it was possible to send him an applicant for a vacancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years allegations have been made, rightly or wrongly, that the only employees in that section were of one religious persuasion—and in Northern Ireland that could be taken as implying one political persuasion—with the authority to refer applicants to prospective employers. The suspicion was that only applicants of a certain political or religious persuasion were referred, and that others either were not sent to the prospective employer or were deliberately sent to a less attractive job, perhaps to one with lower wages, and so on. I suggest that the clause would cover those employed by the Ministry of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, by preventing them from discriminating against anyone in referring them to prospective employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps this is the Question on which to make a brief comment of a drafting nature to the Minister. I want to draw attention to the extremely cumbrous rigmarole—I do not mean the word offensively—that we have gone through in the previous six clauses or so, in interpreting the nature of employment in all these different situations. It appears surprising that it was necessary to take each case separately rather than deal with them by an application or interpretation. One sometimes has the impression with this Bill that it has actually been the policy in drafting it to make it look as thick and substantial as possible. I should have thought that this and the previous clauses we debated were illustrations of the basis of that suspicion. To many of us it appears that the matter could have been dealt with by a relatively simple application clause in the definition provisions of the Bill.

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious matter, because without the amendments a case of discrimination can be pursued beyond the death of the person discriminated against. I want to put the issues seriously, and with an even hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that where actual discrimination takes place, there can be a disadvantage entailed upon the family or descendants of the person discriminated against. It is clearly impossible to deny that the disadvantages created by an act of discrimination could be felt after the death of the person discriminated against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, to pursue the proposition of the grounds on which a complaint concerning a person now deceased was not promoted, and to pursue it on his behalf by his surviving representatives, I suggest is something which, unless there are strong reasons to the contrary, we should avoid. We should avoid it for the sake of the objects which lie behind the Bill. The Minister of State has recognised that it is a Bill which needs to be applied with a light hand, with tact, understanding and discrimination. My anxiety is that these words will, in part, defeat that assertion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know, not only in Northern Ireland, how grudges for which originally there was no real foundation, descend from one generation to another, and are felt even more keenly after the death of the person believed to have been the victim of the act, real or alleged, which gave rise
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
to the grudge. Are we, by this Bill, deliberately going to open up the whole of the procedure to be applied in respect of a person who is deceased?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that a compromise can be found. It may be that where the circumstances involve a definable loss to the relicts of the deceased, it would be possible to retain such a right. But as I understand the Bill, every complaint that can be made for a person living can be made on his behalf after his death. I put it to the right hon. Gentleman that to throw that door wide open is to ask for exactly the kind of resort or attempted resort to this legislation which I do not believe he wants, and which I do not believe is wanted by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to put the subject in a wholly balanced manner, because the object of my hon. Friends and myself in putting it forward is to assist the general purpose of the Bill. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will respond in the same sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond in the sense of answering the arguments put by the right hon. Gentleman. There are valid reasons for the provisions to remain in the Bill. It is, for instance, common in other legislation. Perhaps I may cite some examples. Section 6(2) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, Section 6(2) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, Section 6(2) of the Commissioner for Complaints Act 1969, and Section 6(2) of the Race Relations Act all make the same point. Some of the employment Acts, I understand, also cover the same matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem logical on the face of it to say "Because a person has died, why should not the complaint die with him? What is the purpose of proceeding with it?" The family may be victimised by not proceeding with the complaint. They may be deprived of any compensation due to discrimination to which the individual may have been entitled, and from which the family would have benefited. If we accepted the amendment, so that the case died when the individual died, the family would not benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good precedent for this. It is not the sort of measure that will be used extensively, but there is reason—particularly from the family point of view—why it should remain in the Bill. I am convinced that the agency will want to check the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
validity of the complaint, and I am sure that it would not be taken frivolously by the family of the person concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that it might. I concede that it might, but I think that it is unlikely. For those reasons I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We sympathise with the argument put forward by the Minister. We can understand that families, and possibly widows with children, may feel that they have been disadvantaged because the husband has been disriminated against and that there should be some recompense for them in the Bill. Without referring back to Clause 16, which defined discrimination, I am concerned that the person who is having his complaint investigated has been victimised because it was suspected that he intended to make an allegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point about people genuinely believing that they have been victimised, whether or not there is ground for the belief. If we have a situation where a person was victimised on the grounds previously mentioned, and he was suspected of the intent to make an allegation, he would undoubtedly have convinced his family that that was why he had been fired. He may be in bad health and subsequently dies, and the bitterness engendered by his allegations of victimisation are strengthened by the fact that he has now died. In some way his death will be attributed to the way that he was allegedly treated by his employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would have a situation where that family would seek an investigation on the ground of unlawful discrimination brought about by the person who has since died claiming that he was victimised because it was suspected that he intended to make a complaint. The family would be under pressure to justify his case. But how can a third person, in that particular instance, justify a case when so much of the subjective judgment of the individual who has been victimised will substantially be the case that he has got to make? It is a detail like that with which I would be concerned while taking account of the comments the Minister has made about
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
wanting to deal sympathetically with the family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister of State mentioned among his precedents the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which is more recent. If there is a difference here perhaps he would draw it to our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to look into that question. But perhaps it will help the hon. Gentleman if I say that I have not intimated the time-scale which is involved. It is not an open-ended basis. Such complaints would normally have to be made within two months of the date on which the dead person first knew, or might reasonably have been expected to have known, of the act complained of, or within six months from the date on which the act was committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Referring briefly to the precedents which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned I make two comments. First, in sofar as the Parliamentary Commissioners—the Ombudsmen—are concerned, we are dealing with a narrower and more special area, namely, that of public action of public administration. I would not think it right that one automatically transfers sanctions used in respect of misdeeds of public authority to relations between private citizens. Secondly, in relation to the Race Relations Act and, if it proves to be so, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975—enlightenment appears to be on its way—we have several times, even this morning in this Committee, agreed that we must look specially at what we are doing in the Bill in the context of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has gone some way to remove our anxieties. I wonder whether he can go further because our anxieties arise from the mandatory provision in subsection (1) which operates unless the complaint is frivolous. I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) because I do not think that most of these complaints, after death, could be regarded as being frivolous. They may be unreasonable or unfounded, but it would be hard to find them frivolous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will it be open to the full discretion of the agency, in such cases, to ask itself: "Is there such an appreciable pecuniary loss in this matter to the family and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
descendants that if the case is not pursued, they are likely to lose a benefit which would otherwise come to them"? If it is the right hon. Gentleman's view that the agency, in administering this clause and the subsequent provisions which it attracts, will in general, look to the benefit or otherwise, in concrete financial terms, to the family, such an assurance that that is his view, and that on such matters the agency will work closely with the Department of Manpower Services—by which I mean nothing improper—will go far to meet some of the anxieties, which I think he understands, and which my hon. Friends and I have sought to express.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm to the right hon. Gentleman that the agency will be mainly concerned with the monetary compensation which will affect the family. That will be the central point. It will not be seeking to prove a case. It could pursue a case, but the basis of pursuing such a matter would be monetary—compensation for the family—and that is central to the point. I basically accept what the right hon. Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that assurance, that it will be pursued where a basis for compensation exists, and not for exemplary purposes, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see why, in establishing a deliberate omission, the objective test which one comes to in line 15 is not regarded as satisfactory and sufficient. It is difficult to imagine circumstances in which a person's decision could be given a date when he had taken no actions which pointed to the decision. That is what the words which this amendment proposes to leave out seem to do. They invite the agency, or those who will subsequently deal with these complaints, to date a mental act for which, by definition here, there is no external evidence. I suggest that we take the external evidence of actions pointing to the decision and do not unnecessarily introduce a subjectivity in the lines which we propose to leave out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
