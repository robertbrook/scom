	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Social Security (Adjudication) and Child Support Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 2450).</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. Thompson, to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against the regulations for several reasons. From 21 October, five changes have been brought into the tribunal procedure. Before I go into detail, however, about the changes, I wish to talk about the chaos brought about by their implementation. They require an appeal special form, which is not currently available in a number of areas. I understand from the citizens advice bureaux that such forms will not be available until the new year in some parts of the country, and that people should submit their own written applications. That will lead to confusion, delays and poor implementation of the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oldham Benefits Agency contacted the local citizens advice bureau. It said that one of its clients had sent a letter of appeal about incapacity benefit, but that that was not enough. The client wanted to point out that he should have more points because of his poor health. The letter has now been referred to an independent tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes have been rushed through. Why the speed? The regulations were laid before the House on 27 September, while Parliament was in recess. It is absolutely scandalous that they have been implemented one month later, before Members of Parliament have had a chance to consider them. That action has undermined the Government's wider consultation on approving the decision-making and appeal process of the social security system, which ended 18 October. There was hardly enough time to assess the Government's own consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Parliament rose for the recess, the Government announced their long-term plans for reforming the appeals tribunals and, as I said, the regulations were laid before the House on 27 September. They will abolish the three-person appeal tribunal with a legally qualified chairman. Instead, one person—usually not a lawyer—will sit. Why bother with consultation if the Minister is pushing through the changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now specifically to the regulations and to the harm that they will cause. It is less likely that claimants will attend appeal hearings or be represented at such hearings. The Government's statistics claim that it is three times more likely that claimants will win an
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
appeal if they turn up at the tribunal and if they are represented. Figures show that 47 per cent. of unaccompanied claimants are successful, while only 20 per cent. of non-attenders are successful. That figure increases to 67 per cent. in cases of people who both attend appeals and are represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Non-attendance is particularly damaging in incapacity benefit hearings. Nearly half of the appeals are successful, but that is mainly because of the simplistic nature of the all-work test for incapacity benefit and because of the report of a Benefits Agency doctor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The refusal of benefit is often based on superficial evidence, which is why such claimants win on appeal. If a claimant does not turn up for an incapacity benefit hearing, the doctor's report is simply rubber stamped. People will lose out because of the changes. The main people who do so are those who are not highly educated or who are unassertive. Such people are not necessarily aware of the advantages of an oral appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even those who request an oral appeal now risk being denied justice because of the short period of notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rochdale citizens advice bureau wrote to me, saying that imposing five days' notice would put it under more pressure by reducing the number of people who could be represented. It will be difficult for citizens advice bureaux and other agencies to prepare appeals within five days. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the notice given to my advisers of hearing dates is insufficient now—5 working days, which effectively means that few of our clients will be represented, or even have a written submission prepared for them."</p></blockquote>
We all know of the workload imposed on citizens advice bureaux; they cannot possibly prepare submissions in five days for so many appeal hearings. The bureaux are already over-stretched trying to prepare appeals, particularly in cases involving incapacity benefit. Imposing such a short period of notice will put them under untold pressure; and, of course, if claimants have no representation, their appeals are less likely to be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further reason for opposing the regulations is that many appeals for incapacity benefit are the result of mistakes or oversights by the Benefits Agency or the Child Support Agency. The agencies must first concentrate on getting things right. The Government know that reviews are costly. They want to cut social security benefits. Why can they not get it right first time round, rather than having to create a costly appeals procedure? It adds extra costs to income support, incapacity benefit, child support and a range of other benefits. The Government are avoiding the central issue, which is why I prayed against the regulations. They will lead to vulnerable people being denied benefit, which is why they should be opposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.37 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear from what has been said by the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Rochdale (Ms Lynne) that there has been considerable misunderstanding about why the regulations were introduced and what they seek to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did, indeed, introduce a Green Paper—nowadays, Green Papers come in colours other than green, such is the improvement in colour printing. As the hon. Lady said, the consultation paper, "Improving Decision Making and Appeals in Social Security", is a radical document. If it is to be implemented, it will in due course require primary legislation. However, that is a matter wholly different from what we are discussing this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To avoid further misunderstandings, we made it clear at paragraph 5.8 of the Green Paper that the short-term changes that we are discussing this morning would be proceeded with separately, as they are part and parcel of our good housekeeping—modest, small, practical measures to improve the operation of the independent tribunal service. Those changes are necessary, in a modest way, to stop the system being messed around and becoming less efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue was not mentioned by the hon. Lady; she showed no concern for those who are kept waiting—in the case of appeals to the social security tribunal, waiting almost invariably without benefit. The Government are very concerned that the average delay is currently 26 weeks. That delay has been marginally reduced, but people still have to wait for about six months without benefit before an appeal can be heard. These reforms are directed to reducing inefficiencies; they have no bearing on whether justice is being done, but are designed to ensure that the scheme operates properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone in the Committee is aware of the delays suffered by people wishing to make an appeal, but that is not what we are discussing. The Minister must accept that five days is not long enough for people to prepare a case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady reads the regulations, she will see that it is actually seven days. [HON. MEMBERS: "Come on."] It may be that some Opposition Members have no experience whatever of how courts and administrative tribunals operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, people receive much more than the bare minimum notice. The Benefits Agency tells people in advance the date of the appeal. If that date is inconvenient, it may be renegotiated and refixed. What has become intolerable is that when the parties are content that the case proceed, there is a shackle in the rules that prevents it from going ahead on a particular day. The seven-day period is eminently sensible and practical and, in the context of the practice of courts and tribunals generally, it is relatively generous. It does not cause problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister seriously telling us that someone who may have less than average mental capacity, who may not have English as a first language and who may be ill educated will have to enter into negotiations with an officer of the Department of Social Security, who will be seen as having authority over that person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a coloured and exaggerated example, which does not bear any resemblance to what goes on. If people, whatever their circumstances, want their appeal to be heard on a different date, they simply have to ask. Normally, the request is granted. We must not have an unnecessary shackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are dealing with something that does not happen in the court system. Tribunals were listing five cases a morning, but people were not turning up or there were objections to the case going ahead even though there was a tribunal vacant. The people who suffered were those in the queue; that is the consideration that seems to have gone astray in the objections of the hon. Member for Rochdale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the period is seven days. Is he including weekends? If so, he obviously expects the citizens advice bureaux and other advice-giving agencies to work through the weekend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that. It is not unreasonable to say on a Monday that the appeal hearing will be on the following Monday unless a good reason is given why it should not proceed then. I find it remarkable that that should be a matter of controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now deal with the way in which independent tribunals were giving decisions. I visited the independent tribunal service in Cardiff and spoke to a helpful full-time chairman, who explained the process to me. In every case there, the chairman properly took a full manuscript note of the evidence, wrote out his judgment in longhand and dictated it to a typist. About a week later, the document returned; he proofread and signed it. There were exceptional cases when chairmen helpfully wrote out their judgments there and then so that the appellant could get benefit quickly, but the elaborate procedure I described occurred in almost every case, which we estimate added an extra two weeks' delay before the appellants got their decision. Most of those long documents were never read by anyone for any serious purpose—less than 2 per cent. were the subject of appeal to the commissioners. In every straightforward case, the tribunal chairman had much homework to do and much paperwork to generate, for no practical purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the view that that was simply intolerable. The ordinary county court judge sitting in the country on the first Monday of a month gives 20 or 30 oral judgments there and then. We have introduced, through the regulations, a series of practical, effective options so that the tribunal can decide which course is most suitable for the particular case before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, like the county court judge, the tribunal will have the option to give an oral judgment there and then, which will contain not only the decision but the reasons for it. Some chairmen will want to do that and others will not. The second option applies where the case is more complicated. The chairman will be able to give a short summary of the decision in writing there and then; there will probably be a short adjournment in his room while the bones of the decision are handed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
down in writing so that the appellant knows the result, with an option that the full reasons can be supplied later if the appellant requests them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third option is the present procedure, namely, that a full reserved judgment—both the conclusion and the reasons—can be given later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a practical and effective way of providing justice without generating vast amounts of idle paperwork. Oral procedure will of course be recorded, so there will be no need to type it up unless that is requested. I suggest to the hon. Member for Rochdale that that better accords with sensible administration and with the practical way in which other courts and tribunals operate. It is perhaps surprising that this independent tribunal service did not have those powers earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Returning to the five-day period, can the Minister explain why the Council on Tribunals opposed the reduction in the notice period from 10 to five days, and recommended a period of 21 days?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave way to the hon. Lady out of indulgence, because I thought that she was listening and had a serious point to make about what I had just told the Committee. I shall return to her other point when I reach the appropriate part of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the first change is in the method of giving judgment. It is not a trifling change. It will save a couple of weeks and help the independent tribunal service to deal with matters more expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second change involves oral hearings. Nobody suggests that people who want an oral hearing should not have an absolute right to one. That will remain the position under these rules. People who want an oral hearing should ask for one, and they have an absolute right to one. I hear what the hon. Lady says. People who turn up are likely to do better. There is a 19th century French proverb, "He who is absent loses". Anyone who has experience at the Bar, as I have, will immediately appreciate the fact that people who turn up and are properly represented tend to do rather better than those who do not turn up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why have the Government ignored the advice given by the Council on Tribunals that it is important to explain to appellants that it is desirable and in their interests to seek an oral hearing in information provided to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is correct. The position on oral hearings is simple: if people want one, under the rules before the Committee they can have one. It is unacceptable to have cases listed for oral hearings to which people do not turn up—to which they never intended to turn up—resulting in the tribunal wasting a morning slot. Tribunals try to organise a sensible list that keeps waiting to a minimum for everybody involved. People may not want an oral hearing for various reasons. They may be ill-advised; they may have been advised that they do
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
not have much of a case and may simply be going through a paper exercise. But if they want an oral hearing, they can have one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable to make it incumbent on the appellant to ask for an oral hearing. At the same time, we will protect the tribunal from being mucked about by appellants who never intended to turn up, but simply wanted to block the queue in an unacceptable way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have with him a form that is handed to appellants to explain that they may appeal either orally or in writing, and to point out that it is to their advantage to turn up for an oral hearing? Do they have such a form handed to them that is written in plain English? If so, can we see it now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the final leaflet, which will be issued presently, but the Benefits Agency has been instructed to give full guidance on how the system will operate under the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council on Tribunals did not want to do quite so much as the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) suggested. It wanted us to confirm that there was an absolute right to an oral hearing. We have happily confirmed that, because it is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->

There are a number of other matters that were not referred to by the hon. Member for Rochdale, but which are also important. Regulation 7 makes it easier for an appellant to withdraw his appeal, thus partially remedying the situation of appeals proceeding to a full hearing even when the appellant has decided not to appeal—another piece of administrative nonsense that simply clogged the list with cases that would never be properly pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 6 frees chairmen from basic interlocutory work, such as agreeing to postponement requests, by making it possible for that work to be done by clerks—a measure that directs manpower more constructively. Regulations 3 and 5(3) give tribunal chairmen strengthened powers of direction to permit speedier disposal of cases where there is a lack of co-operation, where unreasonable demands are being placed on the organisation, or where the case lacks merit. Such directions will also make appellants' responsibilities clear to them and include arrangements for expeditious handling of the case. As in any other court or tribunal system, the tribunal will have proper powers to deal quickly with cases where the appellant has not been sensible or has mucked the tribunal around and to give direction where there is a failure of compliance. I stress that it is only when an appellant fails to comply with the direction that anything worse will happen to him.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The reasons for an appeal are important. It is almost inconceivable that a decision could be appealed against without an appellant stating what that decision is or without giving an indication of the basis of the appeal. If at least basic requests are not made of the appellant, the system gets clogged up with people appealing simply because they do not like the original decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous leaflet made no mystery about giving potential appellants a certain amount of guidance. We have built on that. We are not talking about a formal legal pleading whereby if one does not get the technicalities right, one's case will be struck out. The purpose of requesting information is to give the tribunal an indication of what is being appealed against and the basis of the sense of injustice. There are cases, for example, where the receipt of benefit is dependent on age and the appellant is over or below that age; if that were the only point of appeal, it would help everyone concerned and speed matters up if that could be identified at an early stage. Such a case could be disposed of quickly without taking its 40 or 45 minutes in the morning list and thereby stopping other people's cases from being dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of information required is subject to the good sense and judgment of the tribunal. Whatever the type of appellant, we cannot allow every aggrieved person—and people are understandably aggrieved when what they have asked for its denied them—the right to an appeal process without having the basis of their unhappiness identified or without a form of check being introduced. I am sure that the tribunal chairman will operate the powers of direction fairly and sensibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain why appeal forms were not made available throughout the country from 21 October, when the regulations were enforced? When will they be available nationwide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In about a fortnight. The regulations make no absolute requirement to use the appeal form; that is merely the suggested procedure. If someone prefers to write a letter, including the few pieces of information requested on the appeal form, that would constitute a perfectly valid appeal. Guidance has been given for the Benefits Agency, which will inform potential appellants of the arrangements until the new form is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister therefore issue further guidance stating that letters are acceptable? In certain areas of the country, people are being told that they cannot appeal because they have not used the proper form; they have sent in a letter. As I have said, in the case that I mentioned the letter has not been accepted, although that decision is now being looked into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for expressing that concern. Clearly, that is wrong and it should not happen. Regulation 4(5)—new paragraph (5A)—states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an appeal is not made on the form approved for the time being, but is made in writing and contains all the particulars required under paragraph (5), the chairman of the tribunal may treat that appeal as duly made."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
There is no intention to impose unreasonable technicalities. It is sufficient to provide the information in writing. If people are being told wrongly that that is not good enough and if the hon. Lady can give me more information, I shall look into that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer a hypothetical question. Before the hon. Lady becomes angry, let me explain how the procedure operates. Obviously, if the Benefits Agency or the independent tribunal service or, indeed, any other Government Department causes a loss—whether by wrongful advice or administrative mistake—to a member of the public, there is a well—known scheme for compensation. No doubt that scheme could be applied to the sort of cases that have been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other small details in the regulations. One of the more bizarre, out-of-date features of the old measures under which we had to send out notices to a person's current address even if we did not know what it was is dealt with by regulation 8(4). The old regulation has been removed, and we have tidied up matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend these modest, good-housekeeping regulations to the Committee. In the legal world, they are quite boring and commonplace. Generally throughout the legal system, they have been seen as necessary for the better administration of courts and tribunals for many years. Even if they are novel in this aspect of tribunals' jurisdiction, they are well established and common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was good tactics for the Minister to speak second, because his case is threadbare. The right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler) is nodding already. I shall appeal over the Minister's head—I hope that he will respect that—to his Back-Bench colleagues, as profound issues about the regulations are simply being glossed over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister uncharacteristically talked about people being messed around and mucked about. He said that the comments of my hon. Friend for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) were coloured and exaggerated. I suspect that he is slightly unsure about some of the problems that he is inheriting as a result of the regulations. Indeed, his last comment to the hon. Member for Rochdale suggested that things are going fundamentally wrong, and he was honest to say that he would look into that. As the Minister has to look into elementary matters now, he will have a major headache as problems, such as those that the hon. Member for Rochdale mentioned, unfold within his Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is often difficult to find, there is a spirit in the House for consensus and co-operation on issues that should not be about ideology or party politics. The regulations should be such a subject. The history of the appeals system from the introduction of social
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
insurance in 1911 is one of tremendous success. That success has been built on under both Conservative and Labour Governments. However, under the regulations, which are not just boring bits of law, that process is in danger of being not only halted but reversed. That is the profound disquiet that the Opposition feel about what is going on. That is why I should like to think that Conservative Members, who are often dragooned into statutory instrument Committees, will listen to the concerns being expressed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a nutshell, the measure is a fundamental attack on the protection that has been afforded to millions of people in trying to negotiate what is increasingly an extremely complex social security system. There are two issues at stake: the regulations themselves; and—I shall choose my words carefully—the shambles of the consultation process surrounding them. I urge the Minister to acknowledge that the new appeal machinery will make the system less accessible and less effective. It will be more complicated, more confusing and more bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is about fairness and reasonableness. Groups and organisations have made comments and expressed their anger about the regulations. They agree with us that an insult has been handed out to organisations such as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, the Disability Alliance and a host of others who work at the sharp end in dealing with an increasingly complex system. They go far beyond the remuneration that they receive for their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have shown a contempt of Parliament, which I shall discuss in a moment. It is extraordinary, even by the Government's standards, that we find that while Members of Parliament are away, the mice will play—the mice being Ministers in this case. Parliament is being held in contempt. We try to uphold the traditions of the House that have developed over centuries, so we cannot be happy with a Government who ignore not only the opinion of the public, claimants and voluntary organisations, but the traditions of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, at the core of the issue is a comprehensive attack on the rights of individuals and the independence of tribunals. We should be giving a lead by introducing sensible regulations that take rights forward and increase protection. Tribunals must be independent and have the necessary means to carry out their work. Apart from the generality of appeals within the system, of which there are hundreds of thousands every year, we have a profound concern for those in the community who are among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in terms of being able to process their rights through forms, procedures and appeals. I appeal to Conservative Members to consider the difficulties involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before discussing the detail of the changes, which I feel the Minister glossed over, I want to put on record the process and the nature of the shambles that has unfolded since 23 July when the consultation
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
document, "Improving Decision Making and Appeals in Social Security", was published. People wanted to respond to that document and I gather that many organisations have done so. On 23 September, Order No. 2450, which we are discussing today, was made and four days later, on 27 September, the order was laid. The 18 October saw the end of the consultation for the document published on 23 July and then, with breakneck speed, the regulations were implemented on 21 October. Now, on 7 November, we are having a debate. Any organisation or institution looking in on us must think that that is absurd beyond belief. The consultation was a sham; the whole thing is a mockery and, on 7 November, 17 days after the regulations have been sent out to the offices and implemented throughout the country, here we are in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not well up on the definition of a shambles, but this must be quite close to what that definition might be. It would be helpful if the Minister could apologise. He could do the decent thing on the consultation process and take this nonsense away, talk to his senior advisers, people at the Benefits Agency and those involved in tribunal procedures. He should again on a matter that could be profoundly damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shambles does not stop there. The Minister referred to advice that was going around the offices. He may contradict me but, accepting that the regulations were introduced on 21 October, I belive that the first document was sent to adjudication officers, managers and appeals officers on 7 October—14 days before the regulations took effect. The first line in that long circular stated, "Sorry, the 23-day rule can't apply because the orders were laid on the 27th". The implication is there but even by the standards of the Department, in terms of its own consultation and negotiation, it had breached the time that would be allowable to do things properly. I expect the Minister to respond to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is even more fascinating than that. Obviously it was issued by Quarry House in Leeds, Room 3, S25—just to add to the whole mystery. One paragraph said that typists will need new letters, which should be available in January 1997. I am talking about the period from 21 October to January 1997. The Minister alluded to that—along the lines of, "Well, we'll just carry on using the old forms; a bit of form here, a bit of letter there. As long as the process includes all the arguments and as long as they are valid, fine." Is that a recipe for efficiency, simplicity or help? Of course not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is extraordinary. Even typists, who do an excellent job in the Department, were mentioned. They are crucial to ensuring that people receive the information that they require, but they will not receive the necessary letters to do such work until January. Equally important, the document goes on to mention the new advice and the new form, but it does not even give the precise date of January. It says that they might be available "in the new year". Is that July of next year or January of next year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government through to the benefit offices have not a clue of what is happening in the real world. People, whether in a Conservative, Liberal Democrat
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
or Labour constituency, are involved in appeals procedures. They are at the sharp end, along with the helping organisations. But what do we find? They have been subjected to a nonsense of a consultation process. Even the benefits offices are not prepared; they do not know what is happening. That can only add insult to injury for those people in the real world whom we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to be charitable and suggest that what has happened is part of a Benefits Agency ploy to enable it to say to the Minister, "Look, we are sick and tired of all this. Please drive the regulations through. It will make life easier." Or is it a ploy of the ministerial team in the Department of Social Security? If no case can be made for the changes, why have they been introduced? Why should we want to disadvantage people under the system for no good reason while steamrollering through the changes in the shortest time possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation is one thing, but the changes themselves are a more important consideration. The first significant change concerns the form to launch an appeal, a matter of which I have made much already. It does not represent merely a legal crossing of a "t" or a dotting of an "i"; it is something profound for many people in the system who cannot negotiate. A present, people can write a letter when they want to appeal. That makes life easier because the onus is on the system, not the individual. It is vital that that is retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forms allow the bureaucracy to dictate the basis on which the appeal will be made. That is not the function of the appeal procedure. It should be to allow people to exercise their rights. The independent tribunal procedure should process the information, thus ensuring a level playing field and fairness. It is important that we register our protest on behalf of appellants about the fact that while there are no new forms, there will be more confusion but, when the new form is introduced, people will be disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that when people appeal, they will have to give a summary of the arguments in favour of that appeal. We are not talking about Rhodes scholars, people with PhDs or people with degrees in higher technology. At the sharp end of all this nonsense are people who have difficulties in numeracy and literacy. Some of the people who come to my surgeries—like those, I am sure, who come to the surgeries of other hon. Members—find it difficult to negotiate life. We are not here to make subjective comments about whether that is good or bad; it is a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the example of long-term benefit claimants having to pass the in-work test. They have to fill in a detailed claim form saying which so-called "descriptors", of which there are more than 100, apply to them. They score points on the basis of what they have said. To appeal against a decision under the new rules, people must cite the descriptors under which they are appealing. The difficulty is that local offices have been told that appellants will not be given access to the papers on which a decision has been made. Some
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
people will not appeal; others will be placed at a considerable disadvantage because they will receive the full papers only when they get notice of the appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister was faced with a dilemma about that, which is not to doubt his ability. People have a formidable task; not only do they have to appeal, they have to say what they are basing the appeal on from a list of 100 descriptors. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister is looking round, hoping that advice will come to confirm whether that is the case. If it is, it is a disgrace, and I hope that the Minister will deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point concerns oral hearings. Again, the Government say, "If people want a hearing, of course they can have one." That is not the issue; the issue is automaticity, because people will settle for a paper hearing. Again, we are talking about people who do not know the social security system or what their rights are, so why should we further disadvantage them by making them appeal without the automaticity of the oral hearing? We should take that seriously, as it is a matter of how easy it is for claimants to exercise their rights in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been proven from answers to parliamentary questions put to the Minister, people who obtain an appeal hearing have a significant chance of success. The Minister says, "That is common sense. If you're in the courts, of course you'll make a case. If you're not, you'll have less chance of winning." As the answers to the parliamentary questions show, the success rate is dramatic when a person is present, represented or both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister is making it difficult for people to get a form, difficult for them to fill it in and difficult for them to find arguments to submit to the Department. He hopes to cut the number of appeals by ensuring that people do not know that they have an automatic right to an oral hearing. I ask the Minister to answer those charges and justify the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point relates to the notice period. The hon. Member for Rochdale is right: it is immaterial whether we are talking about five or seven days or five or seven working days—the notice period is still far too short. The Government justify it by saying that they want to streamline the process. That always worries me; when we are in. Government next year, we shall find out how this mystical process works. There are experts in the procedures in the tribunal system and at the citizens advice bureaux who tell the Government that the period should be longer. What do the Government do? They cut the time from 10 days to five days and then, after negotiation, back to seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that a straight case of bloody-mindedness? Or is it a case of longevity in government and an attitude of "we know best"? It seems ludicrous when people want some consensus on central measures for the Government to impose changes on those people who are arguing the opposite case; they want more time, the Government want less. The Minister must answer that point and not be so dismissive as he was to the hon. Member for Rochdale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth point is about the power of a chairman to determine which appeals he considers to be "hopeless". Again, is that right, which we are to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
devolve to tribunal chairmen, legitimate? They will be able to make more decisions that are not scrutinised by anyone. What is the background to that change? Is that just another piece of the jigsaw under which the Government are removing and undermining people's rights? The Committee deserves an answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point—there are many other issues, but I am just summarising some of our key concerns—relates to the 21 days notice. The change is dressed up as the Government wanting to short-circuit the process because it is far too bureaucratic, but it involves people's right to know what is happening. There is a summary of the appeal, and if any party wants a written appeal, it can get one. The automatic protections that the Minister may dismiss, but which lie at the heart of the success of the social security system, are to be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made points about the consultation and the major changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that a number of members of the Committee want to speak. Without wanting to spoil his argument, I hope that he will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect that, Mr. Thompson, and I shall try to be brief. I want to set out the comprehensive case against the regulations, but I accept your strictures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeals procedure involves people with disabilities, people who are mentally ill and the confused elderly—people who may be at even more of a disadvantage than other claimants who appeal. I ask Conservative members of the Committee to acknowledge that there are many people in those categories in their constituencies. The knowledge and understanding of such people will be limited; so may be their literacy and numeracy. The impact of the changes on such people will be savage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of the changes are wrong in principle and in practice. The question of efficiency and professionalism in Government is begged. We have been advised that many of the decisions will be contested in the courts. That process is difficult for people who are on benefit. It is not disputed that the Government can introduce these measures by statutory instrument based on primary legislation, but courts will often decide the case of a person appealing the ruling of a chairman of a tribunal. That could be avoided if we had a sane and sensible approach and discussed some of the practical issues, instead of pushing forward a programme that will cause additional misery to many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to think again, to write to the offices to tell them that the regulations due to come into force on 21 October will not become active, and then to embark on the decent thing, which is to speak to the voluntary sector, his officials, the Benefits Agency and those involved in the appeals procedure, and to discuss with the Opposition some of the points
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
that we have made. That would be reasonable; I hope that he will concede some of the points that we have made this morning and proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Dykes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: By contrast with the hon. Member for Rochdale, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was rather lengthy in his speech, and, I thought, went beyond the ground covered by the regulations. The hon. Member for Rochdale was commendably brief and clear on the main anxieties that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Member for Fife, Central made a valid point, which I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board. I do not suggest a postponement of the regulations; it is much better for us to go ahead as my hon. Friend recommends. I thank him for his clarification of some of the detailed points, and hope that he will have another opportunity to respond. It would be much more effective to proceed with the regulations and changes, but I should like the Minister and his colleagues—and, indeed, the officials in the Department and the relevant agencies, and those connected specifically with the appeals modality—to monitor closely how things work out in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not right to say that the anxieties expressed about the changes, some of which are already in operation, are imagined or concocted by politicians, or are part of the conventional party political process. I share some of those genuine anxieties and apprehensions, and they must be dealt with. That is the job of both Parliament and Government, whatever coloration the Government might have. I am worried that even if the intentions of these policies—the commanding heights—are good, we are gradually, inexorably and somewhat tragically creating a society with two classes—a prosperous class still in employment, and an underclass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the aftermath of the United States elections. Even with the increase in electoral registration in America—it is now linked to the issuing of driving licences—I do not know how many of the United States underclass vote regularly. It is sobering, however, to reflect that only 38 per cent. of the adult electoral population in America voted; presumably President Clinton was elected by about half of that number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dykes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can immediately relate that point to the regulations, Mr. Thompson. With your characteristic patience, you will hear it in just a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to see those tendencies develop in this country. I presume that all Members of Parliament conduct active surgeries; we are not yet all on the Internet, although I suppose that that day is approaching. However, we have all had to deal with distressing cases. Even under the previous regulations, people were confused and anxious when approaching the appeal stage. I therefore welcome the changes,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
which seek to make the system more efficient for appellants. That is a rational motivation, which I entirely support. I also support the Government's continuing anxiety that taxpayers' money should be properly expended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I see the contrast in broader terms—for instance, a naive judge saying to the wife of Kevin Maxwell, "Of course, I am sure another hearing would be very distressing to your husband. He has already suffered enough. We will set that aside." Nevertheless, applicants at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum in our society often face considerable personal and family distress. Applicants are often in a desperate state, many believing that there is something wrong with them. That is particularly pronounced at the appeal stage because, for obvious reasons, it is much harder and more stressful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the system is run properly, it can be very beneficent and benevolent. I certainly wish to avoid enhancing the creation of two nations, which I believe is directly relevant, even to these detailed regulations. Economic and social hardships increase, which naturally produces an increase in the number of original claimants, plus more appellant claimants in the later stages. The result is that in the second stage of that psychological and atmospheric process, claimants are made to feel even more guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all under stresses like that, including those who work in the agencies and run the appeal procedures. The tendency is that staff who are overworked and overstressed resent and dislike applicants. The Government's job is therefore to ensure that the regulations are fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like most Members of Parliament, I am closely linked with the excellent work done by the local citizens advice bureau. The citizens advice bureau in Harrow used to be located next to the marriage guidance office, now Relate, which was run by a divorced gentleman—a fascinating proposition. The Harrow bureau has done a tremendous amount of work in recent times in trying to soften the harshness that is creeping into the system. That harshness is not, I think, politically willed. I do not believe that my hon. Friend the Minister is like Newt Gingrich—he does not give that impression—nor are my colleagues. However, the country faces that danger as financial resources come under more pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to dismiss the submissions of the citizens advice bureaux, nationally or locally. I respect their work, and I know people involved in it. When they tell me that they are anxious and distressed about the changes to the system and that the changes were made at the end of the summer recess, I am bound to take notice of that. It would be absurd for a Member of Parliament to dismiss those people by saying that they were a load of lefties and their concerns were tendentious rubbish, and I will not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to go into more detail, but there is not time; however, I shall mention the three matters that I said I would address when the submissions about the regulations were sent out. Although it may be a hyperbolic case, the CAB may say in one of its official bulletins—documents that many members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
public respect—that the legislation was slipped through during the parliamentary recess and that it will severely affect citizens' right to have access to justice. The Government should respond strongly to such arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main submission document states, on page 2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The law relating to social security and child support is very complex. There is a large imbalance between the parties to a decision, both in terms of technical awareness of the rules and in an ability to give a cogent, written presentation of the relevant facts of one's case. Many of those claiming welfare benefits are among the most disadvantaged in the community due to unemployment, poor health, old age, disability or caring responsibilities."</p></blockquote>
I have a particular sympathy for people in the last category. People whose first language is not English also face special problems. It is our duty to respond to that concern of the CAB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The submission states on page 3 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the minimum period of notice of a hearing"</p></blockquote>
—an issue that has been raised—
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been reduced from ten days to seven days."</p></blockquote>
I am not satisfied with the responses that we have heard on that. Page 4 of the document deals with early problems of implementation—I shall not read out the whole excerpt because I am sure that would make you justifiably impatient, Mr. Thompson—and with forms. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Claimants are … having to make their own written applications, which may or may not be treated as adequate."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has tried to reassure us on that, but if he has time, I should like further reassurance. I wish to use the proceedings of our debate to reassure my constituents in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council on Tribunals is such an important body that it would be foolish to say that its views do not matter. I do not think that that is the Government's stance, but I am concerned about what may happen in future. In this country, we have a solemn duty to run a social security system that is humane throughout all its stages. There should not be even the slightest indication that some members of the Government feel that claimants are just a troublesome underclass and that the harsher we are with them, the better, even if adopting such a stance wins public sympathy because other people are also under stress and, even if they are employed, are worried about losing their jobs. We have a million people who earn only £2.50 an hour and that is not something of which our society can be proud. We must run a humane system and if we do not, I cannot support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Rochdale on securing the debate and my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central on making essential points that I hope the Minister will answer. But we should particularly thank the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) for his comments. As he spoke, I was thinking of the time in the United States when black members of society had to pass a literacy test to get the vote; one black man in the deep south was presented with a Greek text and asked whether he could read it. He replied, "I can read it: it tells me this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
black ain't gettin' to vote". We all know how common it is for people's brains to go dead when faced with a form—and that is people who are reasonably educated and accustomed to dealing with forms. It is not fanciful or far-fetched to say that many people confronted with forms are in poor health, older than the rest of us, have disabilities or are burdened with care responsibilities. It is even more difficult for them if they are also ill-educated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us why people have to fill in a form at all—why can they not simply continue writing a letter? They could be given a form advising them that it would be helpful for all concerned if the letter clearly explained their objections rather than just saying that they object. Some people might simply write, "Dear Sir, I object to this and want an appeal, yours faithfully…", but if they were advised on what to write, that problem could be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason given for the forms is that time is wasted at appeal hearings, which might spend hours waiting for people who do not turn up. The fact that many of the applicants have the problems to which I referred means that they are more likely to fail to keep appointments. Surely some method could be introduced in the system to allow for the avoidance of undue delay when appeals are being heard. An estimate of the number of people who do not turn up for their appeals for oral hearing could be made. Appellants would probably not mind waiting for a couple of hours before their appeals were heard and it would mean that the chairman and his colleagues did not have to sit around for hours waiting for people to turn up, if that is what is happening. Doctors' surgeries and other organisations manage to cope perfectly well by organising timings in relation to the reality of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the measure is really about avoiding having appellants waiting months before their appeal is heard or whether it has more to do with the Department of Social Security budget and the drive by the Treasury to cut that budget. Will the Minister tell us how much he expects to save from the change? I should like to have his answer this morning. How much did the free-line service cost? It was abandoned earlier this year, but it gave advice to more than 3 million people annually. It is now more difficult for people to appeal successfully. Will the Minister clarify whether there will be backdating for those appeals that are successful and if so, how far back will it go? I have experience—as I am sure have other hon. Members—of writing to the Benefits Agency on a constituent's behalf. Such constituents eventually receive a giro for perhaps thousands of pounds because a failure in the system prevented them from getting all the money due to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister responded to questions about the forms, saying that they are not yet available but will be within the next few weeks. I asked what information is given to appellants explaining that an oral appeal would be more to their advantage than a written one and the Minister said that no such form was available
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
to the Committee, which means that it is certainly not available to the public. As other members of the Committee have said, the matter has been handled with far too great haste. It would have been more suitable to wait until all the processes were in place to ensure that people did not run into unnecessary difficulties. We are talking about the most vulnerable people in society. The hon. Member for Harrow, East is right to say that we must not allow their rights to be swept away because they are less able than the rest of us to speak up for themselves. We all have a responsibility to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4 allows the tribunal chairman—not the Benefits Agency—to treat an appeal as truly made even if it is not on the approved form. Will the Minister confirm that all appeals, however made, will be forwarded to the tribunal, so that the chairman can decide whether to admit them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all have a responsibility to recognise that the people we are discussing this morning are the most disadvantaged in the community, so the system must benefit them. If it fails to do that, we shall carry a heavy moral responsibility for the hardship that will ensue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no need for me to elaborate the charges that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central powerfully put forward. I hope, too, that the Minister and other Conservative Members heed the important speech of the hon. Member for Harrow, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a test case for the Conservative party, which has historically been interested in justice. I hope that it is not too late for members of the present Administration to recall that tradition and that obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The handling of the consultation has been an extraordinary case of high-handed, contemptuous behaviour. That the new regulations should be laid before the end of the consultation period and that they should be brought into operation on the first working day after the formal end of that period amounts, in effect, to the Government telling those with whom they purported to consult that they have no respect for their views and that consultation is a mere formality that the Government are obliged to undertake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment; it is important that he should give an adequate explanation of why the Government proceeded in that way. It is hard for all of us not to conclude that the Government are, in effect, telling serious, responsible organisations which campaign on behalf of the disadvantaged in our society, such as citizens advice bureaux and the Disability Alliance, that they regard them as a pest and a nuisance. The Government are saying that they simply have to go through the motions and that they are determined to do as they like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I explained in my speech, the consultation process was about radical proposals in the Green Paper which have nothing to do with the regulations. There are conventional procedures, involving consultation with the Council on Tribunals, for amending regulations. That usual procedure was followed in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I am not satisfied with that explanation. The Minister has sought to persuade the Committee that the regulations are merely modest, small matters of good housekeeping. He has just suggested that they have no radical significance, but they do. We are debating significant legislation, but the Government have brought it into operation before Parliament has had an opportunity to debate it. The high-handed attitude that the Minister has displayed to those in the field is thus replicated by his attitude to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there is a large-scale problem with modern legislation: a torrent of changes is introduced by statutory instrument. We all accept that not every administrative or regulatory change should be introduced by primary legislation, but the Government must judge the magnitude and significance of the changes that they are introducing. I hope to persuade the Committee that these changes are fundamental in terms of justice. Therefore, at the very least, the Government should have delayed the changes until Parliament had had an opportunity to debate them. Indeed, if such changes are to be introduced as secondary legislation, the affirmative resolution procedure should be used because of their importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to comment on a significant matter of detail that demonstrates the Government's attitude to Parliament. The appeal form that was deposited in the Library in response to a request from my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) was the old April 1996 form, not the proposed new one. If that is true—and I understand that it is—it is at the very least slipshod; it is a significant discourtesy to the House and evidence that in their high-handedness, the Government simply take Parliament for granted. Because of the character of the House of Commons in this day and age and the Government's patronage system—the Government machine that ensures that they have the votes they need to carry their business—all too few questions are asked. Parliament is treated as a cat's paw by this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should reflect carefully on the significance of introducing legislation in this way, because it brings not only the Government but Parliament into disrepute. Does the Minister want to comment on the fact that he has put the wrong appeal form into the Library for consideration by hon. Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will happily intervene. I am so informed, and I regret that, because obviously that is not what should have happened. I have now been informed that the old form has been placed in the Library. Plainly, that should not have happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will appreciate what the Minister said; I am sure that we are all grateful for it. I am not sure whether it is his intention to publish the responses that he has received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has been sitting for just over an hour, and we have discovered three guddles already. Should we not just give up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central has said, the obvious solution to the mess that we are in is for the Government to withdraw the regulations, start again and do a proper job. All these little pieces of evidence support that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful to know whether the Minister is minded to publish the responses to his consultation—I hope that he will forgive me if he has already done so. Perhaps the Department has not had time to complete its review of the responses, but I hope that he will consider it appropriate to publish them, and in particular, the response of the Council on Tribunals, which has a formal responsibility to advise the Government in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an independent body, the Council on Tribunals has a role in ensuring that standards of justice are maintained. Because it is clear that the Government have chosen to ignore some of the advice that the council has given, it is even more important that Parliament and the public should be able to read the advice for themselves, so that they can weigh up the merits and demerits of the Government's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an analogy with the routine practice of the Government publishing the advice of the Social Security Advisory Committee alongside the regulations that they lay upon which they have been advised by that committee. Whereas there is an obligation under legislation on the Government to publish the advice of the Social Security Advisory Committee, I do not think that there is an equivalent obligation to publish the advice of the Council on Tribunals, but the moral and democratic case for doing so is equivalent. I hope that the Minister will have something to say about that in a moment or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told the Committee that the changes are no more than matters of good housekeeping. All hon. Members are concerned that there should be good housekeeping and proper discipline in our public finances. Nobody wants money to be wasted; we all understand that if money is lost in wasteful administrative procedures in the judical system, that is to the detriment of justice and to the detriment of other public services that could be funded by those resources. There is agreement across the Committee about the desirability of a cost-effective system. The Minister is a lawyer; he knows very well that there is inevitably a tension between the demands of justice and the demands of economy. It is incumbent on us to satisfy ourselves that the principles of justice are not violated and the safeguards for citizens are not breached in the Department's perfectly respectable and proper quest for economy of procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should explain to the hon. Gentleman that what we are discussing is not economy. We are spending more money on the independent tribunal service the deliberate intention of producing a faster, better service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I am baffled as to why the Government want to make these changes. The Minister suggested that some of the changes may be in the appellants' interests, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that one or two hon. Members want to speak before the end of the debate, so I should be grateful if he brought his remarks quickly to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what you say, Mr. Thompson; it is a proper intervention on the part of the Chairman. Let me just say that if the concern for justice was being adequately weighed in the policy, the Minister would be doing what he could to ensure that as many appellants as possible—certainly thoses who might benefit from it—should have an oral hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I briefly quote Social Security Commissioner Howells, who said that it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"essential for the tribunal to have the assistance of a properly instructed and competent representative on behalf of the child support officer in all but the most exceptional cases."</p></blockquote>
That relates to one specific field, and Social Security Commissioner Goodman stated of another that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the presence of a presenting officer is essential to inform the tribunal of the relevant facts and regulations and to answer any questions."</p></blockquote>
We have already heard evidence of the dramatically higher success rate for appellants who have oral representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that I raised with the Minister on an intervention. I know that he has received advice from the secretary to the Council on Tribunals, saying of regulations 22 and 11 that the council
	<br><blockquote><p>"urged that the right of appeal be explained clearly to appellants, that the procedure for seeking an oral hearing should be set out very clearly and that there should be emphasis in the explanation on the importance of seeking an oral hearing."</p></blockquote>
The standard letter to be sent by the clerk of a tribunal after an appeal is received, however, says only:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you wish to have an oral hearing of your appeal, I direct that you should let me know within 10 days of receipt of this letter … If I do not hear from you within 10 days I will assume you wish the appeal to be decided on the paper evidence only."</p></blockquote>
The letter offers no guidance whatsoever on the pros and cons of oral as against the paper hearings, and certainly does not emphasise the importance of seeking an oral hearing. If the Government are seriously concerned that the best opportunities for justice should be available to appellants, they would be doing much more to encourage appellants to seek oral appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They would also want to be sure that appellants can get to the hearing and would not allow a mere 10 days' notice, bearing in mind the difficulties appellants may have in organising representation and making practical arrangements such as child care to enable them to get to the hearing. The Government would
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
also be doing their best to ensure that appellants receive expert advice and advocacy support. Indeed, I hope that the Government will ensure that the citizens advice bureaux and other comparable organisations are properly funded so that they can perform their indispensable role in offering such advice and advocacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making it very difficult for me to call an hon. Member on his own side, so I hope that he will now bring his remarks to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government should consider legal aid at the tribunals. I conclude by echoing the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central that the Government recognise that they have not handled the matter well. They should withdraw the regulations and start again. Even before they revise the appeals procedures, they should focus on ensuring that the original decisions, against which people may appeal, are better handled. The high success rate of appeals suggest that there is something wrong with the way in which initial judgements are reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware, Mr. Thompson, that you want speeches to be brief at this stage of our proceedings. I wish to make two points. First, I refer to sick and disabled people who appeal against the refusal of incapacity benefit. They must put forward their arguments when they make their appeal, but often that information, such as doctors' certificates, may not be available to them until nearer the time of the appeal tribunal hearing. The regulation places an unfair requirement on them; it could result in their losing their appeal. What pressure will the Government put on doctors to ensure that they respond immediately to their patients' requirements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the weakening of the system whereby tribunal judges, so to speak, give the reasons for their decisions. That weakening is bad. There should be a body of evidence and common law judgments that can be used in relation to future cases. Individuals should know the reasons why their applications were refused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have nine minutes left and, out of courtesy to the hon. Member for Rochdale, I shall try to answer as many points as quickly as I can so as to give her a moment to speak at the end of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject the charge that the Government have been high-handed or have slipped the regulations through. We monitor all the time the practical efficacy of the independent tribunal service structures. We introduced other amendments earlier during the year and shall continue to do so. I wish to make it clear, lest there be any misunderstanding, that whatever decisions are ultimately taken about the Green Paper on decision making and appeals, we shall certainly be considering further amendments to the adjudication
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
regulations if we are persuaded in our discussions with those who run the independent tribunal service and others that it is desirable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has not been made clear this morning that the delay in hearing appeals is of considerable concern to all those to whom Opposition Members referred. Those who are in difficulties and need and who are disadvantaged want, if they have a good case, their hearing heard. A period of 26 weeks is too long. It is not a matter of resources; we are spending more money on the independent tribunal service. It is telling us that the adjudicating regulations, before being amended, contained several disadvantages that caused some morning and afternoon sessions to be wasted. Tribunal chairmen and volunteers who act as wing men sit on tribunals with nothing to do because people have not turned up—some of them then never intended to turn up in the first place. That cannot be sensible or in the interests of anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The period of seven days' notice was criticised. The independent tribunal service writes to the appellant at the beginning of the process setting out the likely month in which the appeal is to be heard. Seven days is a fair and reasonable period. I last considered the matter some years ago and, from memory, I can tell Opposition Members that a litigant in person who is before the civil division of the Court of Appeal is told at 4 o'clock the day before that he is to appear the following morning. Let us not be under any misapprehension that seven days' notice is out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) misunderstands how the common law system operates. Mercifully, law reporters do not report 100 per cent of everything that goes on in the High Court because even in the High Court most decisions are of no legal interest to practitioners. A small selection of what has happened, embodying important legal principles, is reported and drawn to everyone's attention. Of course the individual appellant needs to know why he has lost the case. That is why a summary notice is issued. But to expect the chairman to dictate and have typed a long series of findings and evidence is simply, in 90 per cent of the cases, a waste of time. It is not read, nobody needs it, nobody wants it. If people want such details, they can be provided under the changes. They are designed to be sensible and practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East raised with some force the matter of monitoring the changes. We shall, of course, monitor them with great care. Ministers visit the independent tribunal services; we are anxious to see how the scheme works and whether any further improvement can be introduced. The comments on the Green Paper might help us in the short term with the adjudication rules of the existing system. We shall consider every suggestion from whatever quarter. If we can make the system run better—more humanely and justly—and produce results more quickly, we shall do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to hear that the wrong form was placed in the Library and, if that is so, I can only apologise to the Committee and the House, as that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
plainly unsatisfactory. However, the importance of the form has been grossly exaggerated. Normally, those who go for help to a Member's constituency surgery say that something wrong has happened, and the Member asks them what they think is wrong about it. People must have a basic idea of why they say that something has gone wrong before they complain to anyone. It is neither onerous nor complicated to ask people to identify that simple matter. They can do so in a letter, but it is generally helpful to use a form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear about this. The form used—I intend that all offices shall have it in a fortnight—will be simple compared to the application forms for income support, those used for many other benefits or those that most of us encounter when dealing with public bodies. We are asking for an answer to a simple question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the answer to the hon. Lady's question is yes. When people go to Member's surgery and say, "Help—we haven't got enough money," and neither they nor the Member knows why the system has treated them in that way, the Member normally asks those who run the system for an explanation. If people do not understand why they do not appear to receive what they think necessary and fair, the sensible way to proceed is to ask the Benefits Agency for an explanation and help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people are vague and uncertain about a problem, it is unsatisfactory for them to clog up the appeal system with a matter that could be dealt with quickly and easily. When the problem has been identified and explained, people have a right to appeal. That is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have not answered everyone's questions, I shall now conclude because I want to give the hon. Member for Rochdale a chance to have a last word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that I have only two minutes. I urge the Minister to withdraw the regulations and rethink, taking into account the views of disabled people, elderly people and unemployed people. The regulations will hit the most vulnerable people in society. The Minister has not answered questions about the speed of the regulations' introduction, or said why they were laid before Parliament during the recess or why we did not have a proper chance to debate them before they became law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delays in the appeal tribunal process are, of course, wrong, However, reducing the period to five working days or seven full days, whichever the Minister uses, is not right. The Council on Tribunals
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
recommended 21 days, which would give claimants and their advisers a chance to prepare appeals before they go to tribunal. The oral hearing is essential, as is representation, to ensure that appeals are successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that forms are not necessary, so why have letters not been accepted in several cases? The Minister said that, if I supplied the relevant information, he would reply to me, but similar problems occur elsewhere. The Minister should advise appeals tribunals that letters are acceptable, because they do not appreciate that fact even though it is written down in black and white for them.
