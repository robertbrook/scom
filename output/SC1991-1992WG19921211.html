	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.—[
	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I am grateful to be able to make a point of order 30 seconds after the start of the Committee. It is important, as it relates to the papers available to members of the Committee. The question often arises of whether papers are made available to right hon. and hon. Members in time to do justice to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received this morning a document, "The Rural Initiative", that was apparently issued in Cardiff on Monday, but which was not obtainable from the Vote Office. It was available in the Library, but I was not aware of that. That document is clearly relevant to today's debate. A pile of relevant press releases have also been issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful, Mr. Hughes, if you will pursue that point outside the Committee with the appropriate bodies. Is it possible to have the same convention for this Committee as exists for others such as European Standing Committee B? Papers are made available to them about a week in advance, particularly if there is a heavy wad of papers to study. A similar arrangement would give members of this Committee an opportunity to link up with people in Wales who have relevant comments to make, so that we could contribute more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point made by the hon. Gentleman. I understand that 25 copies of "The Rural Initiative" have been available in the Library since Monday, and that copies were posted from the Welsh Office on Monday. The document has therefore been available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I am glad to see you in better health, and I am sure that the other members of Committee share that sentiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome our new Clerk, who served for five years with me on the New Building Sub-Committee, so I know his capabilities. Perhaps he will be able to guide us on my point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On numerous occasions, I have been accused of raising bogus points of order. On this occasion, my point of order relates to the sittings motion. The subject of today's Committee is important to hon. Members with constituencies in Wales, but I understand that the Prime Minister is to report on Maastricht to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
House this afternoon. In all probability, he will make his statement at about 4 pm—the same time that we are to reconvene. A headline in 
	<i>The Times</i> today implies that the Prime Minister is returning with good news. Most Opposition Members doubt whether it will be the news that we wanted the Prime Minister to bring back from his talks in Europe, but its subject matter is important to everybody in the Principality and the rest of the country, and to our relationship with Europe—so it is essential that we consider seriously whether to have two sittings of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Order Paper states that we will meet again at 4 pm, subject of course to the sittings motion. I hope that the Committee will agree either to withdraw the sittings motion for this afternoon—which would mean that there would not be time for all the expected speeches from the members of our respective Front Benches and that other hon. Members would have to shorten their speeches or not speak at all before 1 o'clock—or to postpone our afternoon sitting from 6 to 8 o'clock. Although that would delay dinner, it would give members of the Committee an opportunity to be in the Chamber when the Prime Minister makes his statement and to conclude its business later. Will you ask the Committee, Mr. Hughes, whether it agrees to amending the time of our afternoon sitting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwyilym Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I agree with the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell). We expect a statement from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister this afternoon, knowing that he has secured in Maastricht a very good deal for Britain in reaching an agreement with our Community partners that embodies important protections for Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That development is especially important for Wales. A feature of the agreement that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has brought back—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is not debating Maastricht. I urge right hon. and hon. Members to reach a decision quickly and not to take up our time this morning with points of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes—though I am prepared to take my turn if the Secretary of State wants to speak first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Make it brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am upset that we have not seen the documents that were left in the Library. We can pass a motion on a subject only if we have properly debated it. Many of us believe that Welsh Grand Committees are a waste of time because they cannot achieve anything. If our powers are limited anyway and then we do not have the proper documentation, what is the point of being here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell). In fact, I go further. If we adjourn now, we could spend our time more usefully elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. According to information given me by a person who was told this directly, a representative of the Conservative party in my constituency telephoned a member of the Radio Maldwyn Association to say that she was personally assured by the Secretary of State for Wales that funding will be made available next year for the Radio Maldwyn project. She said that she was told that in confidence by the Secretary of State before his announcement on Monday, and before today's sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it in order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman is entirely out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much in the hands of the Commitee on the sittings motion, but I take issue with the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), because we always have worthwhile discussions in Welsh Grand Committees. I enjoy them enormously, and derive great benefit from hearing the views of all right hon. and hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating a wide-ranging subject—the urban and rural regeneration of Wales. Some documents to which the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) referred may be relevant, but others may not. The hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell) suggested that the Committee should not sit this afternoon. If the Committee agrees, perhaps we could meet this morning and agree, through the usual channels, when to continue our debate. I am in the hands of the Committee. If it, the Committee approves, I shall be happy to withdraw the motion, but we can of course continue this sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. Hon. Members have referred to the availability of documents to the Committee. This has been a problem on several occasions, not just on the Welsh Grand Committee but at other times. The suggestion was made that it was adequate to have them placed in the Library. It is the practice for other Departments to ensure that such documents are also available in the Vote Office. I have been told that there is a common problem in the availability of documents from the Welsh Office. I am sure that that will concern the Secretary of State. May we have an assurance, through you, Mr. Hughes, that that will be put right for the future, so that documents will on all occasions be made available at the Vote Office at the same time that they are placed in the Library?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Secretary of State will take notice of that representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly follow up that point, Mr. Hughes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the urban and rural regeneration of Wales.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I am very pleased that we have this opportunity to debate the vitally important subject of the urban and rural regeneration of Wales. That subject is very close to my heart, and one to which the Government is prepared to devote a high level of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday, I published the results of the rural initiative consultations that I launched in this Committee last February. As well as setting out the way forward to press ahead vigorously with the development of the economic, social and environmental fabric of rural Wales, I announced an additional £29 million of spending in the rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike last February, today we are discussing urban as well as rural Wales. And today I am announcing my decisions on the urban programme, the projects that I am supporting as projects of special or regional importance, and local authorities' capital allocations for next year. The urban programme includes more than 200 projects; there are 10 new special and regional projects; and total local authority capital funding has increased by 24 per cent to £536 million which I expect to lead to total spending of £631 million. The important issue is how best to target resources and to use them to maximum effect. For that reason, I have given a consistent emphasis to four objectives, right across the range of urban and rural regeneration policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we must create a sound economic base. Without that, our policies could not be sustained and would not carry conviction. Our success so far gives us confidence that we are on the right track. Secondly, we must involve the community. Regeneration will not succeed unless it responds to what local people want and need. The most effective way to achieve that is for communities to have the opportunity to be fully involved in the action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we must work together. The lesson of successful urban regeneration from around the world is that all the agencies must act in concert. Fourthly, we must concentrate our effort where it is most needed—and back it with resources and Government action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have for a number of years given strong emphasis in the urban programme to economic projects. We set a target of putting a minimum of half the resources into projects with a direct economic benefit. In the coming year's programme, the proportion is almost 60 per cent. But we must involve the community which is why I launched the community revival strategy. Another £1 million of urban programme funding will go to those projects in the coming year, bringing the total to £2.5 million. We are empowering the people to realise their own projects for the benefit of their communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The increased funding is very welcome, and if it is to be channelled in rural areas through the Development Board for Rural Wales, it will be money well spent—as is plain from the board's presentation this week of the British business park in rural Wales.

Will the Secretary of State answer the question that I attempted to ask earlier, on a point of order, as to how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
such matters are announced? If money is to be made available to Radio Maldwyn in the next financial year, I shall support that wholeheartedly. However, no mention of that appears in the press release issued today. Has the right hon. Gentleman given an assurance to a member of his party in Wales, in advance of publicising his intentions, thereby enabling that member of his party to telephone the organisation concerned and provide such information before it was even disclosed to the House and to the Committee? If the right hon. Gentleman did so, will he explain why? He knows that I respect him greatly, but such an action seems to be potentially in contempt of the House. If he has not, will he please rebuke that member of his party for not telling the truth to people who are intimately involved with an important project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In February, I announced in this Committee a one-off increase of £20 million for projects, £5 million of which was in the form of a competition in which I invited local authorities to participate in projects. On Monday, I announced that I will convert that competition into a rolling annual programme that will, in the coming year, be increased to £6 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also said on Monday that arrangements must allow for unavoidable slippage in approved projects. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) should be aware that Radio Maldwyn was a project put forward by the local authority for approval under the terms of the announcement that I made earlier this year, and I approved it on that basis. I was then contacted by the hon. and learned Gentleman and by Jeannie France Hayhurst to try and find a way of speeding up the consideration of Radio Maldwyn's application. I understood that had been done and that matters were progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Jeannie France Hayhurst told me that she had been contacted by the local authority, which was very concerned that the project was slipping. I was asked to consider, if the project was slipping for a good reason, extending the approval that I had already announced for the project to carry on into the next financial year. I have made it clear that projects that I have approved and which are slipping for very good reason will be considered as having a high priority in the next financial year. Therefore, my remarks must be seen in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Radio Maldwyn project is an extremely good one. It is exactly the sort of project that should be supported under the programme that I announced. That is why I am not prepared to let a perfectly justifiable slippage mean that the whole project will be aborted. I made that clear to Jeannie France Hayhurst, and I make it clear now to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the hon. and learned Gentleman and to Jeannie France Hayhurst, who have set an example of what should happen in many constituencies, in showing that political parties can come together in backing local projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Across the urban programme as a whole, a record proportion of next year's resources will go to the voluntary sector—22 per cent of the total, which is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
increase of over £2.5 million. That includes resources to fund a project that will promote arts in the valleys and to help to ensure the success of the imaginative and innovative Valleys Live 92 project. I am delighted at the way in which that project has caught the imagination of people in the valleys. In many ways it is just the sort of project that should be supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key feature of the urban programme allocations this year is the concentration of resources on more comprehensive strategies. For the first time, we have backed that with forward commitments of around 20 per cent of the programme for the next three years, to give a secure basis for longer-term action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, we agreed with the local authorities to measure the deprivation indicators for not just districts but the 800 individual wards in Wales. We placed a greater emphasis on projects that benefit those wards, which enables us to focus more accurately on where the greatest needs are. As a result, the balance of the programme has changed. More than half the programme will go to the 10 most deprived districts in Wales. That is a £1.4 million increase. More than 60 per cent will go to the valleys, but more also will go to North Wales—nearly 20 per cent compared with just over 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The map showing the deprived wards rightly includes those such as Llanllyfni in my constituency, and Holyhead. It does not appear that any resources are being directed to the Llanllyfni ward, where one of the most important developments is the bypass. Will the Secretary of State see whether that project can be speeded up, to fulfil the commitment to the areas in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but we are talking about the urban programme—I shall comment on the bypass in a moment. I rely on local authorities to produce viable projects for the urban programme and I will investigate that example to see whether an application was received. If so, I shall ascertain what element made it ineligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is the greatest need we will fund major strategies to tackle it. Local authorities made an excellent response to my request for strategic plans of action, and I responded by devoting more than 10 per cent of next year's urban programme to them, with further funding guaranteed for the following two years. That will make a major impact where it is needed—in Holyhead and West Rhyl, Brymbo, the upper Afan Valley; South Llanelli and Pontardawe; Tylorstown, and Cardiff's South Riverside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those strategies complement the targeting of resources by the Welsh Development Agency under its Urban Development Wales programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just 20 more words to say, Mr. Hughes. The borough of Ogwr cannot afford to build it, that community hall, but it could have been done in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that was almost exactly 20 words—I cannot get over that, and congratulate the hon. Gentleman. There were good projects from Ogwr, which are set out in a document that I shall pass to the hon. Gentleman. He will be aware of them, and I am pleased that those that we have approved were successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twenty eight towns and areas throughout Wales are benefiting this year from a record £10 million investment by the agency in regeneration activity. Resources are targeted on specific towns and areas where there is need and potential for improvement. Schemes are already under way in Llanelli, Ebbw Vale, Holyhead, the Cynon valley, Rhyl and Milford Haven—among others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have announced already that next year the agency's total gross budget will increase by more than £6 million compared to this year. Within its overall budget, the agency intends significantly to increase its urban regeneration programme, to cover up to 40 separate towns throughout Wales. That will complement the agency's efforts to improve the landscape of Wales through its land reclamation activity. That is why the Government allocated a record £31 million budget for the WDA's Landscape Wales programme this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency has targeted its resources where there are both needs and opportunities for private investment. Cynon valley is an excellent example of a place that is transforming itself, to improve its attractiveness to private sector investment. Inward investment has been at the heart of the establishment of the existing industrial scene in Wales. Since 1983, Wales has secured 832 inward investment projects promising more than 90,000 new and safeguarded jobs and an investment of more than £4,000 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That represents on average almost two projects secured every week for the past eight and a half years. Even that magnificent achievement has been surpassed in the past 18 months or so. The average number of projects secured in 1990 increased to nearly three a week and during the first 10 months of the current year, the weekly average has risen almost to four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am determined to use to the full the powers that I have to support industry in Wales. This year, I announced nearly 170 very welcome industrial projects supported by my Department. Many of those projects
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
involve major inward investment, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the regional selective assistance scheme is also helping many small home-grown companies in Wales that are vital to the future of urban and rural Wales. Since 1990, more than 300 offers of RSA worth almost £28 million have been accepted by small companies. Associated investment is £189 million and the projects promise to create nearly 6,000 new jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned Brymbo. Four hundred acres of land in Brymbo have, for a year and a half since the announcement of the closure decision, remained derelict. Nothing has happened. I want the Secretary of State to do something about the deplorable, anti-social attitude of United Engineering Steel in keeping that land derelict. The Welsh Office, through the WDA or by other means, should get that land into the public sector so that it can be redeveloped and new industry generated. What hope is there of action on that issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the opportunity of meeting Brymbo and Broughton community councils and was able to announce in Brymbo two projects, amounting to £80,000. I made it clear that I am aware of the continuing difficulties and I want a major project to emerge that centres on the whole area of Brymbo. I am keeping in close touch with what is happening, and I expect to meet again the chief executive of UES—when I shall bring to his attention the hon. Gentleman's remarks.

Housing must be an essential element in any strategy designed to stimulate economic revival. I am particularly keen to cover housing, which is why I mentioned it specifically. I want more diversity, more choice, and better quality in housing provision. They are among the primary objectives in the excellent document, "Housing for Wales—An Agenda for Action", published by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. I want to mention some of the initiatives related to those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, local authority capital provision for housing next year will be increased by 48 per cent—including the extra £80 million for mandatory home renovation grants. That £80 million is secured also for the following year, and for the year after that—so that provision represents an additional £240 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. The relevant documents have just been put in front of me. Is that the way in which the Secretary of State and the Welsh Office think that they should conduct a debate of such importance? In reply to my hon.

How can we participate in the debate when the relevant documents have only just been passed to us? I have no intention of staying here any longer under those circumstances.—[

Member for Ogmore had read the announcements, he would have realised that they are not credited as coming from this Committee. However, I felt that it was important to make right hon. and hon. Members aware of the projects, which are not new. Many of those long-standing projects have been published by local authorities. I am trying to bring them all together in a list for the convenience of right hon. and hon. Members. I am happy to explore through the usual channels ways in which I can ensure that information reaches right hon. and hon. Members earlier. I established that the rural initiative document was posted to members of the Committee on Monday, and I apologise to those who did not receive copies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Dafydd Elis Thomas 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may give the Secretary of State and the Committee some relief by returning to the subject of inward investment. Does he consider that the decisions taken last night or early this morning—in particular, on the United Kingdom's stance on economic and monetary union—will be a benefit or a disbenefit to Wales? Will not his Department and the WDI have to work much harder to maintain their record of inward investment as a result of the ambiguity that now surrounds the UK's position in respect of economic and monetary union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never thought that I would quote Jacques Delors, but when the President of the Commission heard the result of Maastricht, he announced that the United Kingdom would become a haven for United States and Japanese investment. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is right, but that cuts across what he said. Maastricht has been a great triumph for the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister personally, and Wales. I am especially pleased about the new regional body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I have made provision for £26.3 million for other individual renovation grants, and £40 million for area renewal, rural housing initiatives, estates partnerships, and homelessness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Clwyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State accept that the majority of workers in my constituency—there are not many of them—and all those who work in Wales will be appalled that the United Kingdom has opted out of the social charter, which would have protected the rights of so many workers in Britain? Again, we are seen to be lagging
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
behind all the other countries in the European Community in not providing properly for women at work. The charter enforces women's rights, yet the Government have continually opposed all moves in the Community to promote the rights of women. That is true of maternity provision and the protection of low-paid workers. It is appalling that this country is again dragging behind all the other progressive countries in the EC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say, without any qualification, that the Government accept that there is a social dimension to the Community. We implemented 18 of the 32 measures in the social action programme. No other country has implemented more. However, we could not accept further extensions of Community competence—not on health and safety, an area in which we are ahead of the rest of the Community—in relation to employer-employee relations. At the outset, we said that we would not allow the Community to adopt measures that would drive a coach and horses through hard-won trade union reforms of the past 10 years which reduced the days lost through strikes from 29 million in 1979 to fewer than 2 million last year. I was pleased that other members of the Community accepted our view and decided to drop the social chapter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To tackle effectively the problems of an area, we must consider housing problems alongside environmental, social and economic issues. Those need to be tackled as a complete package. For example, our new arrangements for area-based housing renewal ensure that our focus can be wideranging. We already have two renewal areas—in Holyhead and Cardiff—with several others in the pipeline. In those areas, local authorities are working closely with other public bodies, the private sector, and the community to support effective long-term urban renewal. In South Riverside, the housing revenue account will be complemented by the urban programme strategy. That co-operation will bring tremendous benefits for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing provision is of course as vital in rural Wales as it is in urban areas. On Monday, I was pleased to increase the reserve for rural housing authorities from £3 million to £6.8 million. Our purpose in establishing the reserve was to encourage districts to develop a broader range of cost-effective and innovative approaches to rural housing, in partnership with housing associations and local builders and developers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next year, I shall target a further £12 million to rural housing provision in addition to core funding. Of that sum, £10 million will be provided from central reserves for local authorities and £2 million will be deployed directly by Housing for Wales. I shall announce tomorrow the full extent of Housing for Wales' programme, but I can say now that its rural programme, together with the resources earmarked for local authorities, is expected to lead to 1,225 new units in rural Wales in 1992–93. That compares with plans at this time last year for 890 units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always acknowledged that a flourishing agricultural sector is vital to the economic, social, and cultural well-being of Wales. We are investing about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
£150 million in the industry this year, and the four agriculture Ministers jointly launched "Our Farming Future" last month, which outlines the changes that are required to enable the Welsh agriculture and food industries to make a continued contribution to the nation's economy and rural way of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the agencies is also vital. The Development Board for Rural Wales focuses on six growth areas and 12 special towns. No settlement in mid-Wales is more than 15 miles away from one of these growth points. The Board is also developing an innovative and imaginative western areas initiative to stimulate investment in the deeper rural communities of Wales, and during the 1990s it will put significantly more resources into them through its special rural action programme. I am delighted to welcome the securing of an important £6 million investment by the DBRW in close co-operation with Welsh Development International.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fisher Gauge, which I visited on my recent North America trip, and so met Bill Fisher and his colleagues, are pre-eminent in the field of precision zinc die casting technology. They chose to locate their European headquarters at the development board's new business park in Welshpool. That is very good news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WDA's work in support of rural areas is well known. At the beginning of last year, the agency launched its rural prosperity programme. As a result, 15 rural communities will benefit from a co-ordinated programme of action totalling more than £5 million. Throughout the Principality, rural towns and communities will benefit. Together, the agencies will continue to play a key role in creating a wide range of job opportunities in rural Wales and in strengthening local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Countryside Council for Wales—the formation of which provides the basis for a new, integrated approach to countryside policy—has already drawn up imaginative plans for developing its role. I attach high priority to ensuring that they are adequately funded, which is why for 1992–93, I have allocated an additional £3 million to the council for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agreed with the council that, subject to consideration of its proposals, it should launch a pilot scheme similar to countryside stewardship in England. Tir Cymen will be an excellent scheme, and I am making the necessary funding available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Around one fifth of the economy of rural Wales is estimated to be tourism-related, and the Wales Tourist Board plays the central role in the strategic marketing of Wales. I have therefore decided to increase the resources available to the board in 1992–93 by £2.5 million, which will enable it to mount a major new marketing effort in the UK and Europe. More than £400,000 will be specifically focused on rural marketing and projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1992 national garden festival will be the UK tourist event of the year. It was awarded to Ebbw Vale for three reasons—to clear up dereliction, create jobs, and stimulate regeneration of the whole area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Underpinning the garden festival itself is the extensive land reclamation scheme at Ebbw Vale. My
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Department, through the Welsh Development Agency, has already spent almost £20 million on this scheme, covering some 240 acres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to announce today that the WDA has come to an agreement with Wistech to acquire and reclaim the site as part of the company's plans to relocate to a more suitable site in South Wales. That will add 1.2 hectares of industrial land to the reclamation scheme at Ebbw Vale. That additional work to make further environmental improvements and enhance the massive regeneration of the area will be worth some £2 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Infrastructure is a vital part of any regeneration programme. We demonstrated our recognition of that in the 8.6 per cent. increase in local authority capital grant and credit aprovals that I am announcing today. For 1992–93, we have made £67.5 million of provision for transport grant assisted schemes, which will support 29 major road schemes—an increase of five on the current year. Nine of them are in the valleys, and a further two are in the Cardiff bay development area. I am also delighted that we were able to provide further support, through the Project of Regional and National Importance programme, for Mid Glamorgan county council's valleys rail development strategy. That is in addition to the £2.35 million we have already provided. It should lead to the enhancement and completion of the Maesteg line project, resulting in inward investment, economic development, and increased job opportunities in the area. Those provisions are on top of the £195 million for the central Government roads programme for next year, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport announced last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that in talking about the urban and rural regeneration of Wales, I thought that no part of Wales would be left out.

Regeneration must include an area's cultural and leisure activities. Quality of life should not be despised, and although thousands visit Wales for its scenery alone, those who live there are entitled to other leisure facilities as well. Projects included in the schemes are the restoration of Swansea's old guildhall, and the Newport transporter bridge in the PRNI programme. I have saved a most important new project of that type until now, because I wanted to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Minister of State. It gives me great pleasure to announce today the success of a PRNI bid from Aberconwy district council for a project that I know my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, I have announced support for 218 urban programme projects, 23 projects of special or regional importance, and 29 major local authority road schemes. There are many that I have not mentioned. There will also, inevitably, be disappointment because certain projects have not been supported.

In a forum such as this, where time constraints exist, my speech must be selective, but I am convinced that together, the Welsh Office, local authorities, and various agencies can press ahead vigorously with the development of the economic, social, and environmental fabric of Wales. We have the basis to secure the long-term prospects of both urban and rural Wales. We have an enviable tradition of partnership and co-operation in Wales. I hope that we shall all move forward together to build on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If 25 copies of "The Rural Initiative" were in the Library as long ago as Monday, why were not copies made available on the board for hon. Members at the same time? The media has made widespread references to that publication since Monday. Clearly, it could have been possible for the Secretary of State to give copies to members of the Committee. The right hon. Gentleman should take responsibility for that Departmental mix-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman nominated this date and the subject for debate. He referred to capital allocations and the urban programme. Surely he should have made a statement on those matters on the Floor of the House. He says that his rural initiative is important. He crammed a great deal into his speech, when he could have dealt with the matter more methodically, and with greater consideration, in the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On capital allocations, the Committee of Welsh Districts asked for a doubling of moneys for the renovation of council houses. The problem is severe, and that committee was looking to the Secretary of State to do the right thing. The construction industry is on its knees and needs help. Local authorities also need urgent help with housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister fumbled in Maastricht. He switched Britain to the slow track, which will create difficulties for the Welsh economy. We do not share the Secretary of State's rosy view. The social charter could have helped many people in the Welsh work force. A great opportunity for Wales has been missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement about local authority capital allocations, next year's urban programme and the opera house. No doubt the Welsh Office publicity machine, oiled by a 2,250 per cent increase in its budget since 1979, is already cranking out the story. Additional money is always welcome.

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The generous, or the naive, might believe that recent announcements represent a shift in Conservative policy away from the policies that have created unemployment, the housing crisis and the bankruptcies that the Secretary of State claims that he wishes to put right. Our experience offers another, more realistic explanation of the announcements. We have seen it all before—before the general elections of 1983 and 1987. We know what comes after a Conservative general election victory—a return to more cuts and privatisation. There can be no meaningful regeneration of Wales without economic regeneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh economy is locked into the second Conservative recession in 12 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the self-supporting market economy that the Secretary of State described in his eloquent introduction? Is it the 40 per cent increase in unemployment in the past year? Is it the rise in unemployment in 16 out of the past 18 months or the 88 per cent increase in bankruptcies? There have been 1,317 bankruptcies and insolvencies in the first nine months of the year. Is it the 5.4 per cent fall in output?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is the increases in unemployment in the past year: 60 per cent in Pembroke; 51 per cent in Brecon and Radnor; 47 per cent in Cardiff, North; 46 per cent in Delyn; 44 per cent in Monmouth; 31 per cent in Cardiff, Central. Perhaps it is the recently announced job losses in mid Glamorgan or the 150 Manweb jobs that will go in north Wales, despite a record profit increase of 47 per cent. Is it the closure of Brymbo steelworks in Clwyd, the loss of 200 jobs at Prime Cement on Deeside or the proposed loss of 200 jobs at Point of Ayr colliery? Is it the near-destruction of Laura Ashley—a company that found the going too tough after the disastrous errors of the Government's economic policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alternative view, however, was expressed in Wales recently by the Secretary of State for Employment. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wales has turned the corner on jobs."</p></blockquote>
I understand that he is a Welshman from Llanelli. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not under-estimate the hardships that it has caused. No one who was born and brought up in south Wales needs any lessons in the hardship unemployment brings. The signs are there."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State is far from reality if he can make a statement like that in Wales. How can the right hon. Gentleman speak convincingly about regeneration when he has so signally failed to turn round the situation in beleaguered Holyhead? The unemployment rate there, at 13.2 per cent., is the highest in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After cutting jobs at Holyhead, Sealink is now demanding a pay freeze, cuts in leave and further changes in working practices. Welsh Office Minister proposed and supported privatisation. The future of Sealink-Stena is in doubt, according to the 
	<i>Financial Times.</i> What is the Secretary of State's position on the ultimatum from the Swedish company? The Government have to face their responsibility in Holyhead. So far, ministerial stewardship has not been encouraging and Ministers have been over-sanguine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I shall draw the issue of RECHAR to the attention of the Secretary of State. It is a key issue for the valleys. The Government's behaviour in blocking RECHAR is nothing short of a disgrace. It is an appalling reflection on the Government and it shows how little the Government care about our coalfield communities. Over £18 million of European Community funds designated for coalfield communities in south Wales have been blocked by the Government. As Conservative Ministers squabble in the Cabinet, vital programmes to regenerate the valleys are being stalled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
RECHAR is already operating successfully in France, Belgium, Spain and Germany. It is giving huge help to communities in those countries, creating jobs and training opportunities. Those opportunities would be very valuable in south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Secretary of State for Wales to stand up and be counted on RECHAR. He should speak up for Wales in the Cabinet. He should defeat the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry because it appears that it is he who is causing the difficulty. The Secretary of State for Wales must do the right thing for Wales, the valley communities and coalfields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned housing. Conservative housing policies have been a disaster for home owners and tenants alike. The recent mortgage repossessions have turned many people's dreams of home ownership into a nightmare. There is a crying need for money for new council houses in rural and urban Wales. There is a record shortage of affordable homes to rent. Housing associations have been unable to make up that shortfall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only 338 council houses were started in Wales last year. That should be compared with over 4,000 in 1978. It is little wonder that council house waiting lists are over 60,000 in Wales. Waiting lists have increased by 45 per cent. since 1986. I am told that Cardiff has a waiting list as long as 7,000. In my own constituency the waitng list has grown by 50 per cent. since 1986. Housing policy is a mess. The housing record is a disgrace and Conservative Welsh Office Ministers carry all the responsibility for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers will agree that Wales has more problems with substandard housing than any other part of Britain. Therefore, I acknowledge the extra moneys announced for the renovation of private homes in Wales. Last week I was invited to visit homes in Adamsdown in Cardiff to see the work done by that excellent local authority. As a result of my visit, I ask the Secretary of State what help he will give to model local authorities such as Cardiff. The city council has doubled its spending on house renovation grants for the capital's worst housing. Now, however, Cardiff finds that the debt charges incurred under house renovation grant spending will not be subject to subsidy from the Welsh Office until a full year of repayments has elapsed. That alone costs Cardiff residents more than £293,000, or £1.50 per poll tax payer. There is the definition of a major problem faced by a superb local authority that is seeking to do its best for people who need help urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to explain whey the potentially important new house renovation grant initiative—minor works assistance for old age

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative comes in a glossy document, and it is a clever presentation. I find it to be a compendium of pretty technicoloured pictures, a policy precis and overview. There is even a lifeline being thrown out in one of the pages for the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett). There is a page on fishing and a beautiful technicoloured picture, arguably of his constituents. Unfortunately I understand that about six boats—over 100 people—are out of work in the very industry to which the Secretary of State draws attention. Indeed, the picture is headed with this thunderous truism:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In rural Wales the sea fishing industry is significant in social and economic terms."</p></blockquote>
Well if it is, why does the Secretary of State not do something about the boats that are laid up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman knew more about my constituency, he would know that since 1979 the fishing industry in Milford Haven has received £500,000, that the company that went bankrupt had £125,000, and that since it went bankrupt one of the boats has gone back into operation under the new management of the port authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A glossy document will not save the Under-Secretary's political skin. Mr. Nick Ainger will take the hon. Gentleman's seat from him at the general election—nothing is more certain than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document contains honeyed words about the development agency. I should point out that it was a Labour Government, and the then Secretary of State for Wales, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. John Morris), who legislated to bring the Development Board for Rural Wales into existence. It received a very tepid welcome from Conservative Members. Indeed, the then Opposition Front Bench spokesman on Welsh Affairs, the then hon. Member for Pembroke, Mr. Edwards, regarded it as an instance of totalitarianism at one stage in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State claims that resources for rural areas are being increased. If that is so, which Welsh Office budget will have to suffer so that money is available for the rural initiative? Secondly, on what basis will the allocation of money to local authorities be made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities have been led to believe that the Welsh Office will deploy a beauty contest approach to the allocations. I hope that the Department of the Environment's approach to the inner city programme is not adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The glossy brochure entitled "The Rural Initiative" contains some fine-sounding words about the Welsh language. No one objects to the sentiment, but the reality is different. The Secretary of State has failed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
commit the Conservative party to introducing a new Welsh language Bill. The right hon. Gentleman has dithered and delayed, despite the consensus in Wales on the matter. He is out of line.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a ridiculous question. Hon. Members on the Conservative Benches are so rattled that they ask the most ridiculous questions. The Secretary of State should tell the Committee what he and the Government intend to do. The right hon. Gentleman is dithering; he is hesitant and timid. The regeneration of the Welsh language must start in our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Secretary of State talk about regeneration when so many schools are crumbling away or damp, dirty and cold? Surely he must realise that even two years ago Gwynedd had a schools repair bill of £15 million? In Clwyd the schools repair bill was £13 million. West Glamorgan estimates that the cost of bringing its schools to a decent standard is £40 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding the glossy documents and the Secretary of State's fine and honeyed phrases, teachers and pupils in Wales are having to work in deteriorating conditions. Leaking roofs and peeling paint are all too common in education environment. That does nothing to help to achieve the standards that we want. Increasingly, parents have to provide the basics—not the luxuries—while the right hon. Gentleman reigns at the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to agriculture briefly, although the Secretary of State has drawn attention to some difficulties that he and I know face that industry. The recession has hit agriculture like every other industry. Recovery for agriculture in Wales is even less certain than that for other industries. The work of Dr. Peter Midmore at the University college of Aberystwyth shows the size of the challenge for rural Wales. That university's deparment of agricultural economics predicts that 12,000 farming jobs will be lost in Wales in the next decade. That shrewd and rational assessment shows that the industry faces major problems. Ministers must work even harder to produce the correct policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is remarkable what the Conservative party will do to save seats at the general election. We have seen that today, but the people of Wales will not be fooled.

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have the chance to speak. Tempting though it is to follow the empty, ponderous rhetoric of the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), in the interests of brevity I shall refrain from repeating anything that has already been said. That includes the excellent contribution of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who opened this morning's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two points to make, but I shall begin with a general appreciation of the excellent work of the Welsh Development Agency and of the Development Board for Rural Wales. I congratulate the chairmen of those agencies, Mr. Glyn Davies and Dr. Gwyn Jones. Yesterday, I met a group of Welsh businessmen and was pleased to find that there was general agreement that the WDA has a much improved reputation these days. Businessmen in Wales appreciate that it is now a much more effective and well-focused organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point is that proper planning must play an important part in urban and rural regeneration in Wales. Planning has always caused controversy in Wales, not least when aggrieved constituents are worried about matters being determined by appeal at the Welsh Office. However, a new tendency in planning is that permissions are being given by the other tier of local councils in Wales—the county councils, which are not regarded as planning authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee with individual cases, but three constituencies in Cardiff are affected by such permission being given by South Glamorgan county council. Permission has been granted for the Medicentre proposal in my constituency, for Corpus Christi high schol in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) and for a proposed social services facility that is causing much resentment among the people of Penarth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, we were warned privately that the proposal was a fait accompli and that it would not have been made had it not been approved already by the county council. It is very worrying that such an authority should take over the role of the planning authority proper, which is the district council. I note that, in connection with the Corpus Christi high school application, Mr. Roger Knight, Cardiff city council's planning officer, felt so strongly that he described South Glamorgan county council's action as an abuse of its powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will examine the involvement of this other tier of local councils in Wales in planning matters. I hope that he will ensure that there is no self-interest and that matters are handled in the best way. Further thought should be given to what system can be set up when there are single-tier councils in Wales to reassure everyone that all such planning matters are being carried out properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the debate in the Chamber a fortnight ago on the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill. I shall not go through the arguments again; I am glad that the measure is at last moving forward. The Bill will be considered in Committee after the Christmas recess and all in Cardiff are looking forward to its successful completion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Cardiff would like to know where Opposition Members stand on this most important matter. When the Bill was jointly promoted by the South Glamorgan county council and the Cardiff Bay development corporation, it enjoyed a fair measure of support from Opposition Members, not least from the shadow Secretary of State for Wales, whom we were pleased to see in the Lobby supporting us on various occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, we are seeing a retreat. An amendment has been put forward and, even though Conservative Members called for a clear statement on where the Labour Party stood, it was not forthcoming in the debate on 25 November. I say in all sincerity to the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) that it would be a matter of great regret if there were not the previous all-party support for this most important project. The matter should not become a party-political football in Cardiff, but should it come to that, we will seize that opportunity to tell the people of Cardiff what the Government have been and are doing to ensure that this exciting and important redevelopment takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As long as the Labour party hides behind the artificial smokescreen of its amendment, we must infer that it is moving in the same direction as the city council in Cardiff, which has drifted to the extreme left and is now petitioning against the Bill. I am sure that Labour Members will earn and deserve the censure of the people of Cardiff unless they come clean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only part of Wales is metropolitan; most of it is rural, with small towns and villages spread over wide areas. Against that background, I believe that the Government's policies are wrong in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rural areas are sustained entirely by the underlying great public services such as the networks of transport communications, energy supplies, rural schools and medical services. They are nationwide, public networks were cross-subsidy ensures that the cost and quality of services are equalised across the rural-urban divide and across the nation. That is a fundamental necessity and a fundamental principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under market forces—and the Government like marker forces—there is no way that rural communities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
could sustain any of that necessary infrastructure. Unit costs are high, so only public commitment and public subsidy protect rural roads, rail lines, schools and energy supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is simple, as is the difference between Government and Opposition Members. Rural Wales can only be sustained, let alone regenerated, if the Secretary of State follows policies of public support for public services—policies that are directly opposed to every philosophical axiom that his Government so tirelessly preach to the British people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe passionately in market forces. They believe, above all, in the substitution of private services for public services. The relentless gospel of privatisation marches on. There are only two models of privatisation. The first is monopoly privatisation, affecting telecommunications, electricity, gas and water. It leaves the rural areas entirely at the loss-making, high-cost end of the business. To sustain the rural communities at all, the Government are reduced to the ridiculous position of pleading with the companies not to enforce the free market norms in which the Government believe and to accepting regulation in which they do not believe. I know that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he had suddenly fallen in love with regulation, but we know that he will be persistently unfaithful with market forces. Can rural dwellers have any confidence in the long-term protection of such half-hearted and half-baked application?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second model is dismemberment privatisation, better known as selling off the juicy bits. If British Rail's profitable lines are sold off, the rural lines immediately become basket cases. The buses are the same. Rural services will then run only as long as the Government commit themselves either directly or through local authorities to generous large-scale subsidies to public spending in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did not get where they are today by committing themselves to public spending in principle. So in this model, the future is inevitably one of Treasury squeezing, cutting, reduction of services and closures. Those services are the life-support system of the rural areas. Now, I gather that postal services are threatened, too—and all for market forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can respect some fundamentalist faiths. I could even respect the Ayatollah Khomeini, but his particular dogmas would not have devastated rural Wales. Privatisation, hiving-off, deregulation, and the denial of cross-subsidy all leave the life-support systems of rural communities hopelessly at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the case only in Wales. With a sense of unreality I watch Conservative Members trooping into the Lobby to vote for policies that will crucify their constituents. I want a reversal of policy. In the short term, I want the Secretary of State—I do not say this in any belligerent sense—to ignore the fatwa against the public services proclaimed by the late Ayatollah of Finchley. I want him—I say this in the most friendly fashion—to elude the vice-like jaws of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and to recognise that rural regeneration starts with the network of great public service—it is the idea of public service, not just
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
private profit. I do not really expect a death-bed conversion, however. In the long run, say six months, I want a Labour Government to restore this most commonsense and practical of principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am really making a general point that divides our parties. If we want to live by market forces alone, let us consider the Third world, where rural communities are condemned to a desperately poor existence on the margins of life and where unregulated business and absurdly low taxes go hand in hand with pathetically inadequate public services. Conversely, if we look to sensible mixed economies, based on partnership between comprehensive public services, there will be a civilised party that binds rural and urban regions into a harmonious nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 12 years we have had a Government who denied that partnership, who saw public services as the enemy of private industry. That is a nonsense. Partnership is the key to a civilised society. If we dump the bar-room ideology we can begin to regenerate Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome several of the announcements made by the Secretary of State—the £2 million urban aid in Gwynedd, the opera house in Llandudno, for which hon. Members of all parties have campaigned for some time, and the additional cash for the Welsh tourist board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join in the congratulations on the work of the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. Substantially more work needs to be done on regeneration and those agencies play a valuable and active role, which should be built upon and not undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regeneration of urban and rural Wales is a broad agenda, as the Secretary of State's opening speech showed. I thought that the environmental aspects would be emphasised as they need attention. Environmental improvements in the old, industrial areas are mirrored by the need for improvement in the rural areas. In many centres in traditional rural counties such as Gwynedd, Dyfed and Powys, there is a need for what is analogous to the environmental improvements in the old coalfield valleys of south Wales. I hope that the agencies involved are aware of that. In the slate-quarrying areas of Gwynedd, for example, less work has been undertaken than in the coal-mining areas of the south. I realise that that is because it is more difficult, but more resources are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the old villages that were dependent on the slate quarries need regeneration. The parish of Llanllyfni is identified in one of the maps to which I referred in an intervention. It has been earmarked by the Welsh Office as in need of additional resources, and we look forward to receiving them. The fact that local authority schemes may not have been appropriate for this round does not mean that other agencies, such as the WDA, cannot put money into such areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Villages such as Deiniolen suffer enormous deprivation and towns like Ffestiniog need additional resources. I agree with the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) that a partnership between the public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
and the private sectors is needed if we are to find an answer to the problems faced in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the second time, the hon. Gentleman mentioned Llanllyfni. He will be aware that the Penygroes to Llanllyfni bypass on the A487 was added to the long-term programme in the roads in Wales update in February 1991. The public consultation exercise was conducted last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and I am glad that progress has been made, but there was public consultation in 1978 on a road scheme in Caernarfon—there is still no sign of it. The worry in Llanllyfni is that even though there may be consultation, it will be many years before the road is developed. The area needs a stimulus and the road improvement scheme will provide jobs in the area. It will improve the environment by reducing the pressure of road traffic and it will improve connections between the A55 and the Porthmadog area, to which I shall refer in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the old towns in the so-called rural counties—towns such as Holyhead and Fishguard in Dyfed—have suffered the devastating effects of economic change. Caernarfon has a significant, sensitive tract of land in the old port area which needs regeneration to be undertaken in association with local groups and interests. That will happen only if there is an external stimulus of outside finance, which needs to be organised by public agencies and in co-operation with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Areas such as Dwyfor have come high in several deprivation studies—there is rural as well as urban deprivation. The problems of those areas should be tackled. Towns like Porthmadog are centres for a large catchment area. Trawsfynydd nuclear power station falls within the Porthmadog catchment area. I raised that issue on the Floor of the House on Monday during energy questions. The uncertainty about employment at Trawsfynydd is a serious matter in the area. Many hundreds of jobs are dependent on Trawsfynydd nuclear power station and if it is to be run down, replacement jobs will be needed in that area. The linking of the A487 from the A55 through to Porthmadog and the improvement of the A470 are two schemes that will be important in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister of State, when he was responding to the WDA debate last week, whether he could make a statement that sufficient funding would be available for the agencies. The WDA, DBRW and Antur Dwyryd, the local enterprise agency, will need funds for that area once a closure decision is announced, either through the nuclear installation inspectorate refusing a site licence or through Nuclear Electric. As it is "name the prospective parliamentary candidate" day, I commend to the Minister of State what my nominated successor Mr. Elfyn Llwyd said on this matter. He suggested that £10 million should be made available to those agencies to undertake the work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that helpful intervention from my hon. Friend, and I agree wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
I suggest to Ministers that when employment has been run down in the old coalfield and steel areas, there has been significant finance available from the Government and from Europe. The closure of a nuclear power station such as Trawsfynydd would have an equivalent impact on its catchment area and equivalent finance should be made available by one mechanism or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many parts of Wales there is degeneration not regeneration, for example, in railway services. Something must be done to improve railway services and to stop British Rail running them down, especially the link from Holyhead to Crewe, the service from north Wales to London and the service between north Wales and Cardiff. The urban regeneration of Wales is not just a matter for the industrial counties of Wales, and I hope that the Welsh Development Agency will consider that when it allocates its finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need to avoid new despoilation. There is a danger that open-cast mining will create new problems. It will undermine the quality of life. Before giving the go-ahead to open-cast projects, we must think carefully about the effect that they would have on people living nearby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned housing. There is a major housing problem in many areas of Wales. I have read the Secretary of State's document and I believe that we need a more radical initiative. The planning and housing laws should be reviewed in order to safeguard young people who are trying to buy their first home. In an area such as Dwyfor in my constituency, it is next to impossible for young people on ordinary wages to buy a house. I have been approached by an estate agent from my constituency—not a member of my party—who advocated a two-tier housing market because that is one of the only strategies that will give hope to ordinary people in my area that they will be able to afford a house. It is that serious. We need radical suggestions and I hope that the Secretary of State will respond to the representations that I know he has had from a number of directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To enable rural regeneration to happen, there must be a new confidence in agriculture. That is not there now. The need to attack that problem is agreed by all hon. Members and we need action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of tourism in rural areas was mentioned. I welcome additional resources. Due to the private Members legislation introduced by a Conservative Member, the need for international marketing of tourism in Wales is in our minds at the moment. I welcome the fact that it is a Conservative Member who is introducing the Bill and I hope that the Government will support it on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Welsh language Act was also mentioned. The Welsh Office has had a long enough period between 1986 and 1991 to sort out the implementation of a new Welsh language Act and we look forward to an early statement, as do thousands of people in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned the effect of Maastricht and the agreement reached last night on inward investment. Will not it be helpful to be certain that we will be part of the single currency when we are trying to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
attract supranational projects from the United States and Japan? Wales has been successful in the past in attracting such projects. If that certainty was there, we would be much more likely to attract those projects. I hope that the Government will bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned the new regional committee, which was part of the discussions at Maastricht although it has not received much attention so far. The original French text referred to the new committee's members being directly elected at a regional level. That text was changed—I understand from friends in Brussels—at the behest of the British Government. We regret that change. If Welsh representatives on the committee are to have credibility, they need a base—a mandate—and must be seen to be democratic representatives of the wishes of the area that they represent. Only through a Welsh Parliament will that be achieved. There will be no resolution of the problem of regeneration until there is such a Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret the fact that this debate has been curtailed; we receive little enough time to debate strategic Welsh issues in the House. I hope that another Welsh Grand Committee debate can be arranged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate on the proposed assisted area status for the Monmouth travel-to-work area. My constituents, especially in the town of Monmouth, feel that they have lost out and are neglected. They believe that the borough council prefers Abergavenny and Chepstow and that Gwent county council gives preference to the valleys. I do not want to underestimate the problems of the Gwent valleys, but many people on my constituency believe that the town of Monmouth has lost out as an administrative centre. It no longer has its previous significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that one of today's announcements would concede assisted area status to Monmouth. I shall make the case for that. Monmouth lost assisted area status in the early 1980s. In the past few months, a campaign has been mounted by four bodies—the Monmouth chamber of commerce, Monmouth town council, Monmouth borough council and Gwent county council. The initiative began at a meeting that I had with the Monmouth chamber of commerce, which asked me to put the case to the Secretary of State. I suggested that we produce a document, which has now been drafted. I hope that the Secretary of State will allow me to bring a delegation to present it to him in the new year. Monmouth borough council would rather that I did not go, but it is important that those involved in the case for industrial regeneration should get together, even though we may represent bodies of differing political persuasions. I am especially grateful to Mrs. Shirley Smith, the president of the Monmouth chamber of commerce, for her work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case has four main points. First, there is the changing economic structure of the Monmouth travel-to-work area. The decline of the manufacturing sector has had an important effect on the area. Since 1981, the proportion of the work force employed in manufacturing
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
has declined from 28 per cent. to 10.9 per cent. In Gwent as a whole, 33 per cent. of the work force is involved in manufacturing. The service sector dominates Monmouth's economy and has the problem of low-paid, part-time work. Gwent has the lowest average earnings of any county in Wales according to the 1991 new earnings survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, unemployment is a key determinant in the criteria for granting assisted area status. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for our correspondence on the matter. The criteria for assisted area status should be more explicit. In my constituency the unemployment rate has increased by 44 per cent. over the past 12 months. During that period, unemployment in the Monmouth travel-to-work area has exceeded that of neighbouring travel-to-work areas that already have development or intermediate status. That inequity should be rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, Monmouth has not seen any significant industrial growth since 1984 when it lost assisted area status. It lost out in Wales so-called economic miracle in the mid-1980s. Many of the inward investment announcements seem to have bypassed Monmouth. Investment has been made down the M4, but not up the important roads that lead to Monmouth town and the surrounding area. Nine acres of the Monastow road industrial estate remain undeveloped. Some investment has been made by the Welsh Development Agency, but it has not been fully implemented. There is a feeling that the area has been neglected because it does not attract grants that act as an incentive to new firms to locate there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the report, a survey was conducted of 35 local firms—89 per cent of which stated that they had future expansion plans if the circumstances were right, but 68 per cent. said that the lack of Government grants and assisted area status was a key disincentive to expansion. The Gwent economic survey undertaken by Coopers and Lybrand shows that Monmouth has the potential for new technology companies. There has been a growth of those companies along the M4 corridor, but not in the 15 to 20 miles towards Monmouth. Projects have been lost because of the lack of assisted area status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, I wish to point out one anomaly. Monmouth is a small travel-to-work area and is defined by the border with England. That means that a small number of people are employed in the area which is surrounded by areas, including Gloucester, Cinderford and Ross-on-Wye, all of which have intermediate status. Monmouth is an island excluded from regional selective assistance grants and from European investment bank loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will give sympathetic consideration to the deputation that will come to see him in the new year to ask for assisted area status for Monmouth. That can be achieved by redefining the map of travel-to-work areas. If Monmouth were redefined as part of the Abergavenny and Blaenau-Gwent or the Newport travel-to-work areas, it would automatically benefit from assisted area status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Secretary of State about the need for inter-agency collaboration and for public consultation.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
People in Monmouth feel that that has not happened. Recently, I visited the Gwent training and enterprise council and met people involved in economic development in Gwent county council. We believe that we should collaborate more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monmouth area has a great deal to offer—good road links, a beautiful environment and good quality schools. We have had the valleys initiative; what we now need is a Monmouth initiative. There is scope for collaboration and for improvement in the level of employment and the quality of jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is good to see you among us again, Mr. Hughes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to keep my remarks short. The title of the debate clearly acknowledges the need for urban and rural regeneration in Wales. I thank the Secretary of State for "The Rural Initiative", for assistance to tourism and for the long-awaited initiative for an opera house in Llandudno. However, although it is Christmas, there is also an election coming. All those initiatives must not be allowed to overshadow the many problems in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is a low-wage economy with higher than average unemployment. Recently, unemployment increased by more than 50 per cent. in Brecon and Radnor. Wales has an appalling infrastructure in roads and in rail. It has a housing crisis, with 70,000 people on the housing waiting lists. It has a farming crisis. Its farms have the lowest incomes since the war, and that is having a serious effect on farming communities. It has limited democracy and decision-making powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must ask whether the Welsh system matches the needs of Wales. Clearly, it does not. For the purposes of economic regeneration, the existince of the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales is a positive advantage for Wales. Thank goodness there is a political consensus in Wales about that, and that even Conservative occupants of the Welsh Office, in particular, Secretaries of State, have been prepared to use those agencies for economic regeneration and, indeed, as pump primers for a mixed economy. The reality is that they have been unable to do without the WDA and the DBRW.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the pre-conditions for success are not only development agencies. First, we need a democratically elected Welsh Assembly for all Welsh Office functions. Secondly, we need a truly democratic Europe. Subsidiarity brings power down to grass roots. True federalism is the complete opposite of centralism. The Conservatives got it wrong at Maastricht in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we need a single European currency. I believe that the Maastricht opt-out clause shows weaknesses and is a barrier which prevents increased trade. It could break down barriers within Europe, if it were given the chance, but we are now hamstrung by that decision. Fourthly, we need more investment, and not only inward investment—which amounts to only 7 per cent in rural areas, as the Secretary of State told me recently. We must also encourage organic economic
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
growth within Wales by Welsh entrepreneurs. Fifthly, we need better education and skills training. I am glad to note that responsibility for that now resides in the Welsh Office. Earlier this year, the Secretary of State for Employment lost many battles with the Treasury over providing adequate finance for skills training. Let us hope that the Welsh Office can do better in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In urban Wales, we need greater diversity of industry and more manufacturing of better quality. I estimate that we need to find another 80,000 jobs in urban Wales to crack some of the problems. We need more research and development projects, better road and rail infrastructure and more houses to rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State announced his rural initiative for rural Wales. He referred earlier to slippage, but I suggest that the way in which the public relations of his rural initiative was conducted was more like a slippery slope. We are getting used to hearing about his initiatives by accident. I am sure that he would want to put that right. Sometimes, our Conservative opponents know more about the initiatives than we do. That is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trends that have occurred in rural Wales must be reversed. Although it came rather late in the day, at least we have the rural initiative to try to do something about that. The main factors that push young people out of rural Wales are the farming slump, the lack of housing for young people, especially houses to rent, and low wages. All those factors must be tackled. Within the rural initiative, £12 million has been earmarked for housing for next year. I calculate that that will provide about another 360 houses at a cost of about £33,000 per house. That is equivalent to about half the housing need on my waiting list for Brecknock. That gives some impression of how far there is to go, especially when we consider that Tai Cymru, has created 3,500 housing units this year. There is a long way to go. It should be possible to build 10,000 houses a year in Wales. The reason why council housing receipts cannot be used to build more council houses is beyond me. The Welsh Office must explain that conundrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In farming, the commitment to the family farm must be greater. What is happening in farming communities in Wales is nothing short of a tragedy. Single sons are leaving family farms, and that will alter the situation for ever. In addition, the summary contentions in the sheepmeat regime produced by Commissioner MacSharry, especially the limits on ewe premium quotas in hill areas, must be challenged. The ceiling of 750 animals is inadequate. It should be at least twice as high, as I hope that the Secretary of State has argued that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be direct payments to sustain family farms and lower interest rates. High interest rates have been a singular failure in the management of Britain's economy in recent times. The whole of Wales should be designated as an environmentally sensitive area. That should start with the national parks, which are already suffering from grievous planning disadvantages, for which there needs to be compensation. However, I am grateful for the 36.4 per cent increase in the funding for the national parks. That increase follows a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
period of underfunding, and is no less welcome despite the coincidental fact that an election is coming up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be no discrimination in Europe against Welsh farming, although that seems to be an element in some of the MacSharry proposals. Serious consideration should be given to the DBRW taking on some agricultural functions, especially in connection with the finance and building of abattoirs. At present, there are only four European Community abattoirs in Wales. Some assistance has been given to one of them, but the amount of help is small and the situation remains inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, greater investment is needed in roads, especially in a north-south road and the A470. Many of the road system's bottlenecks must be sorted out. The cuts in British Rail's public service grants must be restored so that people can travel to and from Wales and move around the country in a reasonable manner. It is essential that communities be involved in such decisions because it is important that there be greater democracy in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This has been a pretty good day for me. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has brought back almost half a loaf from Maastricht. That is as much as I could have expected realistically, and is a great deal better than the stage—prop loaf on offer from the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales has filled my Christmas stocking beyond all reasonable expectation. He has given me almost everything that I most wanted. I share the delight of the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) that at last there is to be a north Wales arts centre to provide a home for the great Welsh National Opera. The picture is very bright, and the splendid new theatre in Rhyl will improve that area's image immensely. I am thrilled by the announcement of what is to happen in east Rhyl, which has dragged the whole area down for a long time. That announcement and the co-operation with the Welsh Development Agency to improve the area is an inestimable boon. I am especially delighted that there is to be help for the adventure playground. There is a serious problem in that area, where young people do not have enough to do. Today's announcement will help enormously and there will be bonfires in that area tonight to celebrate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole package is a tribute to the way in which my right hon. Friend has worked with the statutory bodies—the WDA, the WTB and the DBRW—as well as with local authorities of all political complexions, with communities, with people and with private and public enterprise. That is the key to his staggering success. It is an example which others might do well to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to Rhyl bus station. It took an awfully long time to persuade a great public corporation
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
—British Rail—and the newly privatised organisation of Crosville bus services to recognise that not only should they produce a good balance sheet, but that they had a direct responsibility to their passengers. Such public corporations and private companies would do well to look at what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has done in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look around me in my constituency, I see an almost unbelievable improvement in the general environment. When I go to Towyn and Kinmel bay, so recently devastated by terrible floods, it is immediately apparent to me, as it must have been to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales when he visited the area, what a startling improvement has been made in its environment. It is a great deal better than it was before the floods and I think that everyone recognises that. The improvement is having a marked effect on morale in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was uncharacteristically in conflict with my very good friend the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) when he grossly oversimplified the picture when talking about the unrestricted play of market forces. None of us wants to see market forces dominating everything, but equally, it is foolish to deny that they have a vital role to play. Denying that gets people into the kind of mess that they got into in eastern Europe. Without allowing market forces some play, there is no way of finding out where resources are needed, even within the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has struck between the play of market forces, the useful role of intervention that the Government can play and the co-operation between public and private bodies, shows that he is turning out to be a very great Secretary of State for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tone for today's debate was set by the ludicrous paper chase in which Officers of the House ran up and down the stairs to try and compensate for the very late arrival of a pile of handouts which members of the Committee should have had yesterday. Many Opposition Members have been through their mail and have worked for a couple of hours before the start of the Committee, and handing in documents in the Members Lobby at 10.15 am simply is not good enough. There followed the ludicrous sight of the Secretary of State trying to defend this by making his announcements and then saying that they were not really new. He was right about that, because the repeated public relations initiative is certainly the mainspring of current Government policies for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State then came up with the proposal to concentrate on the most deprived areas, down to ward level. That is a return to the concentration on need that was the policy of the previous Labour Government. For the right hon. Gentleman to announce that as a piece of good news, with no apology for the intervening years of untargeted and idiosyncratic central decision-making, is out of place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the capital programme for local authorities in Wales, with £100 million needed for standstill in view
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
of the announcements that the Secretary of State has previously made and sought credit for, this is a minimum real increase. That capital is in itself greatly restricted by central Government decisions. We should remember that this is the Government who stopped local authorities spending their own money to build houses for the desperate families on their waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider this small increase in capital in context. Capital spending by local authorities and the Government contribution jumped in 1983, just before an election. At that time, I was chairman of the finance committee of Cardiff city council when it set the budget. The Welsh Office challenged us to meet an impossible target on renovation grants. We accepted the challenge and, in fact, beat it. But 1984 was not an election year and Government grants to the city plummeted from £,9.4 million to well under £1 million. That is why we say that we have seen it all before. There will be an election next year and mention has been made in this debate of the Government seats, such as Conwy and Pembroke, that will be at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Successive Secretaries of State have played games with local authorities in the run-up to an election. In 1981, the Government's contribution to local authorities' capital expenditure was 37 per cent. It has taken 10 years to get back near the levels of 1981 and 1983, yet the Government's contribution in the present financial year is only 11.6 per cent. That is the base for this year's modes increase. The United Kingdom, and Wales in particular, is being pushed further to the margins of Europe. We should have had a better chance of a full loaf had the Maastricht negotiations been undertaken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), the Leader of the Opposition rather than by he Prime Minister. My hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside has already criticised the loss off RECHAR, which is damaging the valley communities, due the Government's failure to work with and in Europe. There is a danger of the loss of Euro grants to cities such as Cardiff and I ask the Secretary of State to respond positively to the representations of councillor Jon Owen Jones, the chairman of the economic development committee of Cardiff city council, and to support Wayne David, our Member of the European Parliament, in seeking to keep the capital grant assistance. I am sure that the Secretary of State agrees that it is in the best interests of the Welsh Office, as well as of the communities involved, to retain that in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard some ludicrous party political rhetoric from the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones). If the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill had been introduced as a Government or hybrid Bill in the first instance, it would have been law by now. So, the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
we hope that the present Secretary of State will respond positively to the reasoned amendment that we put forward on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
References were made to the need for a Welsh language Act. The Welsh language should be matter of pride and choice—an opportunity for those who choose to use it, an encouragement to those who want to learn it and no threat to those who do not want to use it in our communities. It is clear that we need a Labour Government to introduce a Welsh language Act. Such a measure based on the Labour party policy document, which is published and in the public arena, on the years of discussion and inquiry by an excellent working party, in which I participated, and on the draft Bill from the Secretary of State's Welsh Language Board, whose members are frustrated and ashamed at the Secretary of State's failure to bring forward legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister of State confess to succeeding in preventing his third Secretary of State from responding to the pleas of people throughout Wales for a Welsh language Act?

The Minister's ludicrous attempt to intervene will not get him off the hook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to touch on respect for law and order and tackling the roots of delinquencies in rural and urban communities in Wales. When the Home Secretary announced last week the additional police numbers for forces throughout England and Wales, I was shocked to discover that Wales merited only one extra officer. I was astounded to find that South Wales police are not to have one extra officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the South Wales police area the crime level will be 22 per cent up on last year. I spent a Saturday night with police on patrol in central Cardiff and saw just how thin is the blue line that looks after law and order in the city. As my constituency includes parts of four different divisions, I have a unique opportunity to see the problems faced by the police in a variety of diverse communities. My hon. Friends could replicate that experience and express the same anxieties about rural and urban areas throughout Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must face two facts: first, his party is guilty for creating the conditions for crime and failing to tackle its root causes; secondly, it is guilty because the police do not have the tools to do the job. I set about finding out why no extra police were coming to help our communities. Given the title of today's debate, one of the reasons given is massively ironical: the Government cannot distinguish a rural community from an urban community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
In deciding police needs for each area, the Home Secretary gives a weighting according to whether the area is urban or rural. The formula allows a greater weighting per thousand of urban population. The Government use a bizarre and irrelevant definition of urban and rural. According to their definition, Cwbran is not an urban area, nor is Aberdare, Rhondda, Abertillery, Neath, Barry, Penarth, Merthyr, Pontypool, Port Talbot or Newport. The urban population of Gwent is nil, according to the Government's bizarre calculation; only Cardiff and Swansea fall into the urban category. No wonder the Home Secretary gave a derisory response to the heartfelt plea for more police to restore a sense of security to our communities. After such a crazy decision, how can we place confidence in Ministers who talk to us about the regeneration of our urban and rural communities? They can't tell one from t'other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that I had time to go into the Government's failure to tackle the root causes of crime. Suffice it to say that neither unemployment nor the lack of a decent home is an excuse for crime. However, failure to tackle the economy, to provide relevant training and to create long-term prosperity all help to create a second and third generation of young people growing up with despair an ever-present part of their community. I worked with that type of youngster; frustration with the actions of a previous Secretary of State led me to stand for Parliament. Those problems are not being tackled now. It is not healthy; it nurtures the likelihood of crime and damages victim and delinquent alike and their families and communities.

The Government failed badly even before they ran away from their responsibilities on Sunday trading. That spelt out in large letters the message that in Conservative Britain there is one law for the powerful corporations with a voice at the heart of the Tory party and another for ordinary individuals in urban and rural communities of Wales and England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before today's debate, I wondered how many key elements of regeneration for our urban and rural communities would be mentioned by the Secretary of State. I underline my choice of word because the subject of urban and rural regeneration in Wales is meaningless unless the communities in villages, towns and cities experience the promised rebirth. As it is their motion, the Government might have considered the meaning of "regeneration" that is given in the "Oxford English Dictionary":
	<br><blockquote><p>"To cause to regrow, to replace lost or injured tissue".</p></blockquote>
There is lost and injured tissue in the fabric of our communities in every part of urban and rural Wales. I would have welcome hearing the Secretary of State admit him complicity in the enormous hurt suffered by communities throughout Wales by the divisive, damaging and neglectful policies of the past 12 wasted years of Conservative rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage in such a brief debate, I emphasise that the announcement today of a few million pounds as an election bribe will not fool people in Wales. They know that the misery of a Conservative Government after the election will mean that money will disappear and
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
cuts will be made, just as they did after the 1983 and 1987 elections. Work is needed year after year, not just months before the run-up to a general election, to provide jobs and a healthy economy. People in Wales need decent homes and schools that serve the community and meet the education needs of children in Wales. "Our school in our community" is the Welsh tradition, and the Government must let us return to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Care for the elderly and disabled in Wales should be at a level that allows people independence and a sense of confidence and self-respect. Care in the community as planned by the Government does not have the resources to do the job. In travelling around urban and rural communities in Wales I have been shocked at how thinly the resources are being spread. The Government have failed on transport, training for young people and retraining for those who need to respond to change in the employment market. Health services need to be as local as possible to meet urgent and emergency needs, not the meddling and fiddling with opt-out trusts and the moves towards privatisation that the hon. Member for Pembroke, the Under-Secretary of State, is allowed to push on the local health authorities in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case the Minister of State is tempted to pretend that he did not hear the challenge from my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside, let me take him back to the Government's record. What do his hopes for a healthy local economy mean when we see a 60 per cent increase in unemployment in Pembrokeshire, a 47 per cent increase in Cardiff, north, a 46 per cent increase in Delyn, a 44 per cent increase in Monmouth and a 31 per cent in Cardiff, central? There has been a 40 per cent increase in unemployment overall in the past 12 months. It has risen in 16 of the past 18 months in Wales. Bankruptcies are up by 88 per cent in the first nine months compared with the same period last year. There has been a 5.4 per cent fall in output in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are on their last legs, desperate to run away from their responsibilities. Today's announcement amounts to an attempted bribe to the Welsh electorate combined with complacency and self-satisfaction. No one will be fooled by the glossy brochures. What we need is a Labour Government in Wales as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a red-letter day for Wales and for the United Kingdom with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's tremendous success at Maastricht. We began the day with a point of order raised by the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell), who referred to 
	<i>The Times.</i> However, he neglected to tell us the headline, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Major wins all he asked for at Maastricht".</p></blockquote>
This has been bonanza week for Wales with the announcement of a £29 million additional spend on the rural initiative on Monday and today's announcement, amounting in all to well over half a billion pounds of spending for next year. Yet the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) seemed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
belittle that spend. And there is more good news to come that will gladden the hearts of the people of Wales over the coming weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that in December 1989 my right hon. Friend's predecessor published a document called "The A55: The Road of Opportunity". It is two years since it was published and we believe it is now time to take stock. Much has been achieved and substantial public investment continues to be made in that area. As we have announced today, some 18 per cent of urban programme resources next year will be focused on north Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by my right hon. Friend's comment about taking stock of the A55. Can he say a little more about that, because what he has just said was rather tantalising?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend is tantalised. I shall go on briefly. Much has been done but much remains to be done. Many different organisations are involved in the process and we need to examine carefully what has been achieved, what is planned or already in the pipeline and how the future programme can be tailored to maximise the return from the huge investment in the A55. We have decided to launch a review of the road of opportunity programme. As a first step I am writing today to all the relevant local authorities and agencies to seek their contribution to the review and their views on the way forward. We shall naturally inform the House of developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The massive investment that the Government are making is designed to improve the quality of life of the people of Wales, as we promised in the last election and as we have sought to do year after year. It is happening, in spite of the worldwide recession from which we are now beginning to emerge. There is no doubt in my mind that we are well placed to take advantage of the recovery as it gathers pace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred to the targeting of resources to the deprived wards in Wales. We have targeted, and that has enabled us to fund projects in needy areas, even when they are not in the inner cities. Few of the deprived wards in Wales are in the inner cities, and they will receive more than a quarter of next year's urban programme allocation. The hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) mentioned Rhosllannerchrugog. He will be pleased to know that we have approved funding of about £80,000 for grants and loans for commercial premises in that village.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Holyhead has featured in several speeches. With my special responsibility for the Holyhead areas I do not underestimate the problems there. However, we must not lose sight of what has been achieved. Between 1986 and 1991, unemployment fell by 5.5 points. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary tells me that unemployment in Pembroke was running at 7,700 in January 1987 and was 4,700 in November 1991. The joint venture in Holyhead is in operation. Some £3.5 million have been devoted to the town's redevelopment this year, and there is £1.3 million for Holyhead next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) will have noted that it is one of the 28 towns on which the Welsh Development Agency is concentrating. There is £100,000 for Caernarfon for environmental improvements, and I am delighted to add that another £100,000 is available for Bethesda in my constituency. I know that the hon. Member for Caernarfon will not begrudge that money to the good folk of Bethesda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) will be aware that some £236,000 was allocated to environmental and recreational improvements in Raglan village, and for conversion of disused emergency bungalows into workshops in June this year when the rural initiative was announced. I have to remind him of the unemployment figures. In October 1986 there were 651 people unemployed in Monmouth, and by October 1991 that number has reduced to 401. That represents almost a halving of the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1979 we have spent £630 million on renovating older private housing stock in Wales, a significant achievement especially when compared with the £143 million spent by the previous Administration on all renovation. Since 1982 more than 13,120 homes have been improved under enveloping schemes at a cost of £93 million. Gross allocation for this year is £117 million. That includes private sector funding. It will result in a programme worth over £160 million. Gross allocations are planned to increase by 36 per cent at the end of 1993–94. By that time, Tai Cymru should have increased total housing association stock in Wales by more than a third since 1989. That is substantial progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside referred to RECHAR and additionally. Of course, we are worried that Commissioner Millan has not yet approved the RECHAR programme for industrial south Wales. We hope that he will do so, so that the funds designated for that area may benefit industrial south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom takes the anticipated European regional development fund receipts into account when setting public expenditure programmes, which are higher than they would otherwise be. Local authorities are the main beneficiaries of the ERDF. They benefit from a higher level of credit approvals. We must be clear that responsibility lies neither with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State nor with the Government. The Commission is holding up the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire, North (Mr. Howells) referred to Trecwn. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has asked the Welsh Development Agency, the West Wales TEC and local authorities to examine the problem and consider whether job losses could be alleviated, should the closure be confirmed. The consultation period has been extended and those organisations have been asked to report back to my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to all that has been said during the debate. I have even read the speeches that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside claimed that he would make, subsequently published in the 
	<i>Western Mail</i> on 19 November, but did not actually make. It is clear that there is a dearth of ideas among the Opposition. We have asked repeatedly for the contents of a proposed Opposition Welsh language Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth claimed that if an election had been held in October, a Welsh language Bill would now be in Committee. He and the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside, should, therefore, know its proposed contents. But they do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Livsey), I emphasise that the Government have
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
reduced inflation to its lowest level for several years. We have also reduced interest rates. It becomes ever clearer that we have followed the right policies and that they are beginning to pay off. The people of Wales realise that. A new Wales is about to rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
