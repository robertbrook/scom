	<br><blockquote><p>"paragraphs (a) and (aa) of.—
	<i>[Mr. Bill Michie.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing the following amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 18, in page 3, line 43, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Subsection (5)(aa) of that section shall cease to have effect.".</p></blockquote>
No. 5 in page 4, line 4, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any increase in the rate of mobility allowance specified in paragraph 3A of Part III of Schedule 4 to the principal Act after the coming into force of this section shall apply equally to persons of all ages who are entitled to a mobility allowance.".</p></blockquote>
Before we proceed I should like to answer the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), which appears in columns 52 and 53 of last Thursday's 
	<i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings, concerning the rights of Opposition advisers to special seating and/or communication with members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point obviously raises matters of principle, both in relation to the Chamber, on which Standing Committees try to model themselves as far as possible, and Standing Committees generally. Of course, it is not for me to rule on what happens in the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the Committee is now concerned, it seems to me that the press seats are made available for the press only, and for members of the press in that capacity only. As for communication between the public seats and members of the Committee, there has always been room for some flexibility and give and take, provided that the Chair is satisfied that there is no undue disturbance. Indeed, I have looked at the 1980 precedent, involving the same adviser, Mr. Lynes, and a similar Bill—the Social Security (No. 2) Bill—of that year. The then Chairman, Mr. Mitchell, ruled that this was a question of reasonableness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking (Ms Richardson) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have people in the the public gallery here. The problem is the difficulty of getting messages, notes, briefs and information from there to here. I recall that on the previous Bill there were two or three occasions when representatives from one or other of the charitable organisations were actually remonstrated with by one of the messengers."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
The Chairman replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a question of reasonableness. Obviously nobody wishes to prevent the Opposition from being supplied with information during the course of a speech, or anything of the nature. This is something that we can reasonably supply. It is, naturally, out of order for any adviser to sit in the Committee, as the hon. Member appreciates, but I should not be in any way opposed to a reasonable attempt to attract attention as long as it is not done by standing up and waving arms around. That is a reasonable request."—
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 22 April 1980; c. 23–24.]</p></blockquote>
That ruling seems to have met with general approval, and the precedent contained within it is the one that I and my colleague intend to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, and I believe that reiterating and putting back on the record the ruling that was followed on a previous occasion will assist us. Thank you very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our proceedings last Thursday, I was about to answer a point raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) and my answer was left hanging in the air. I shall return to it in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worthwhile to reiterate one point, particularly because of the reaction of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) to a point that I was making. The Committee will remember that amendments Nos. 17 and 18 were designed to enable people to qualify, for mobility allowance, for the first time, after the age of 65. I said to the Committee that we estimated that the cost of making that move would be about £1 billion. I thought I detected a look of surprise on the hon. Gentleman's face, but I assure him that the best estimate that we can make is that the extra cost would be of that order. Of course, if he and other members of the Committee think about it, it becomes obvious that the prevalence of all disabilities, but particularly difficulty with mobility, increases dramatically as age increases. The OPCS report, "Locomotion Disabilities Among Adults in Private Households" shows that in the age group 16 to 59, the prevalence is 31 per 1,000, from the ages of 60 to 74 it rises to 195 per 1,000 and over the age of 75 to 464 per 1,000. There is a tremendous increase in difficulty with locomation as age advances. That is the basis for our calculation of £1 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return now to the point raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood. The Government will have to look at this matter when we consider the findings of the OPCS reports. We shall have to decide whether our system of help with disability, and the benefit system in particular, is designed to concentrate on people suffering from disability during their working life, or people suffering from disability whatever their age, particularly as the aging process itself inevitably leads to some disability. I do not know where the balance will lie but we shall not be able to ignore it when we consider the overall findings of the OPCS reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for saying that most emphasis should be placed on those who suffer disability during their working life and as a consequence are unable to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
make the provision that the majority of able-bodied people can make for their retirement. That is a logical argument but we shall have to judge in due course where the balance lies between the two groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend give an estimate of the cost of extending the existing provision for life instead of until 80? I imagine it would involve only a handful of people. He mentioned the large figure of £1 billion, which illustrates the problem of giving people a mobility allowance, but I think that he had accepted that there is a difference between deciding to give someone a mobility allowance in old age and taking it away from someone who has already had it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter I received from the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, points out two anomalies. There is no age restriction on people whose mobility costs are covered by the 1976 invalid vehicle scheme; they will continue to receive that benefit after they have reached the age of 80. Similarly, the war pensioners' mobility supplement for people with a walking disability also continues beyond the age of 80. There are therefore two precedents for adopting the same line with mobility allowance as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I understand that. The cost of extending the allowance from 80 to life would not be great. It might cost a few million pounds but it would not be a great deal of money. By extending it to 80 we would effectively postpone for five years the decision whether to extend the awards for a lifetime. In the aftermath of the OPCS report, we shall be able to take a considered view on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be moving on to the question of whether to extend the allowance for life. Can we move back to the main purpose of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short)? The Minister rightly says that there is a logical argument for restricting the benefit to people of working age. The corollary of that is to maintain the age barrier of application qualification in its present form. When the mobility allowance was introduced by the Labour Government, it was made clear that although that was a logical means of maintaining the distinction, it was done on the grounds of economy because it was a new, and necessary, benefit. In order to restrict its cost at the early stage, that logical argument was pursued but it was not thought that that should stand for all time as a necessary qualification. It was a means of phasing in a high-cost benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only start from where we are—65 has endured throughout the life of this allowance. I am not seeking to prejudge the view that the Government will eventually take when they have all the OPCS reports. The cost of £1 billion would have to be weighed in the balance against other priorities that may emerge in our consideration of those reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), admitted that the other amendment was a probing
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
amendment tabled to see whether the Government had any intention of paying mobility allowance at a different rate from that which would apply to people under the age of 75 or 80. The amendment is not needed, and the hon. Lady probably recognises that, because the law already states that any increases to the rate of the allowance must apply equally to all beneficiaries. There would need to be a specific provision in the Bill if we wanted to restrict the amount payable to any group of recipients. There is no such provision, which is clear evidence that we have no intention of restricting the rate of mobility allowance payable to those who benefit from the extension of the age 75 cutoff, or to any other group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our record on mobility allowance shows our commitment to it. We took mobility allowance out of tax and increased it in real terms, and since we came to office in 1979, the number of beneficiaries has increased by five times. It is too early to take a view about the shape of mobility allowance or its relationship to other benefits, subjects that are dealt with in the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys' study. I hope that the explanation and undertaking that I have given will be sufficient for the amendment to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised when the Minister produced the figure of £1,000 million to pay for the changes that are proposed in the group of amendments. I should like information on the series of figures that he gave on the proportion per 1,000 head of population at various ages. Do those figures refer simply to people suffering from restricted movement, or to the proportion per 1,000 head of population that would expect to qualify for the benefit? There is a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the OPCS study used as its criteria. I suspect that it would not have used the stricter interpretation. Like other members of the Committee, I have sometimes been surprised when constitutents have been refused mobility allowance, despite their circumstances, because the qualifications are so tight. We should know whether the OPCS definition uses a less strict test. That would mean that the full cost of paying mobility allowance to those who cannot move unassisted would be less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cost savings can be made by increasing the extent to which mobility allowance is paid. The Government have done quite well with the allowance. It is one of the better benefits, and has done reasonably well in their hands since 1979. One of the most cost-effective ways to use the allowance is to use it to keep people out of institutional care. If folk are severely restricted in their movement but are otherwise fit and intellectually bright, there is nothing to prevent them from living at home if they have a wee bit of assistance to get out and about, do their shopping and visit their friends. The mobility allowance goes a long way to meeting the costs involved. We would keep many people out of residential care if we used the allowance more intelligently. Of course, I understand that a balance has to be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do I detect that the Minister is committed to an extension in some direction? As he has to consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
all the angles, he cannot put a figure on it or tell us in which direction the Government will move. It would be helpful if he would confirm what I understood him to say—that he is committed to some extensions in some directions at some stage in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would probably be unwise to go any further than I have gone. As I have said, when we consider the OPCS information, we shall have to look at this aspect in the round. However, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) may have detected where my sympathies might lie, although I am not committing the Government to a particular action. When I gave those relevant OPCS figures, I was not suggesting that the figures per thousand would constitute people's entitlement to mobility allowance. They simply show the increasing mobility difficulties as age approaches, and a percentage of those people would qualify for mobility allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face the prospect in the coming decades of an ageing population, with more and more people living beyond the age of 80 and therefore qualifying for mobility allowance. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the precise formula that led me to the figure of £1 billion, but if he drops me a line I shall give him the workings that might help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return briefly to amendment No. 5 before letting my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) speak about the main amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted with interest what the Minister said. I am not sure that I would go so far as to say that I welcome it, as he did not say enough and was extremely cautious. He showed that he was sympathetic, but unfortunately sympathy does not pay the bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that if the Government intended now to freeze the mobility allowance or to change the way in which it is paid as a quid pro quo for the age change in the Bill, such a change would need to be in the Bill. Naturally, we recognise that, but the fact that the Government do not intend to proceed in that way this year does not guarantee that the measure will not be in next year's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister chose his words with obvious care. He said that there is no provision in the Bill and that that is clear evidence that the Government do not intend to make such changes—I am not sure whether he then said, "at the present time", as that would have been rather blunt. He told the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that is too early to take a position on the overall shape of the mobility allowance provision until all the reviews have been received. Although we all hope that that means an improvement in the way in which mobility allowance is paid—the Opposition will continue to press for such an improvement—we should be going too far if we were to read a substantial reassurance into the Minister's words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
I do not wish to be ungenerous to the Government—perish the thought. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and, earlier, the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) praised the Government—indeed, the Minister praised himself—for continuing to pay mobility allowance. We are glad that the Government continue to pay it. The number of people who became entitled to mobility allowance increased, and the Government continued to pay the allowance and even improved it. However, that is not exactly a revolution; the Government are simply carrying out the initial intentions of the previous Labour Government, who increased mobility allowance, but they are not making substantial improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be borne in mind when discussing the Government's record that they have cut disability benefit sharply. Any increase in the amount of money being allocated is often largely due to the number of people who have gradually become entitled to claim those benefits. We welcome the fact that the Government have nevertheless continued to pay at least some of them, but we should not go over the top in praising their record, particularly considering the resources that they have had available during their term in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am pleased that the Minister has at least given qualified assurances that there will not be a new clause to change the position. I hope that that also means that there will be no clause to freeze mobility allowance next year or in any future year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish quickly to respond to the lack of answers to amendments Nos. Hand 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that it is impossible to help everybody in the world, but I am concerned with fairness, rather than cost. It is unfair that someone who is struck down with a disability a few days before reaching the age of 65 will receive at least 15 years' benefit, while someone who is struck down a few days after the age of 65 will receive no benefit. He will be unable to appeal and there will be no consideration of his needs, problems or medical condition. Not all people can qualify because they are over 65, looking a bit groggy and cannot walk as well as they could before. As has been said, the rules about qualifying for disablement benefit are strict enough. One is not likely to be considered favourably just because one has a limp. It is almost a miracle when someone receives approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that every old age pensioner over the age of 65 who is now groggy through age should slip through the net and finish up being a financial burden to the state. The examination process provides the structure for making such decisions. It is better to make a judgment on the medical condition of that person rather than on the fact of age. The Minister said that mobility dramatically declines as age advances, which is obvious. However, knowledge of that fact does not make older people more used to it or give them the ability to cope with it. The opposite is true. If an older person loses the use of one of his or her limbs, he or she will find it even more difficult to be mobile because general strength, physique and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
physical ability have gradually deteriorated. Therefore, those people probably need more help over the years than some of those who have rightly qualified before the age of 65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how many people are involved, as I am not sure that the Minister gave a satisfactory answer as to how the figure of £1 billion is arrived at. That sum must mean a hell of a lot of people. Let us assume that it is £1 billion. There must be many people in the country who would be definitely in need, according to the Government's criteria, if there were no age barrier to mobility allowance of one form or another. Therefore, the fact that a large sum of money is involved has increased my concern for the ever-growing numbers of people who are written off from any financial help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our previous sitting, it was pointed out that our whole social structure has changed. More and more people in that age group are living on their own. They are not living in communities where their family or friends live near them, or in the sort of accommodation that they lived in in the old days, with larger rooms and easier access. We are talking about old people living in flats on first, second and third floors who cannot move about without physical financial help to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often in the new estates old people live further away from the whole communities—from the city centres, places of entertainment and hospitals—than in the past. Therefore, they have added problems on top of their disabilities. Yet the Government are not prepared to consider the possibility of help for these people over 65, which is absolutely necessary. I hope that they will think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Labour Government decided some 10 years ago to extend the payment of mobility allowance beyond 65 to 75, they must have considered, as we have to consider, whether it was right in those circumstances in cost terms, or in terms of the basic philosophy behind the benefit of helping people of working age, whether to extend the qualifying age, as well as the payment age, from 65 to 75. They clearly decided against it. I cannot believe that they did not address this issue. Until we have the full findings of OPCS and can see what action we have to take about the overall shape of benefits, it would be wrong to make any commitment to this vast sum of money. We need to consider the matter in the round, and against other priorities that may emerge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said in our previous sitting that the reason why it might be possible now is that we are in a so-called boom time. When the Labour Government were in power, they did not have the benefit of North sea oil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 4, line 4, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any savings of mobility allowance paid under that section which the recipient intends to use in connexion with mobility shall be disregarded in calculating the amount of any income-related benefit payable under Part II of the 1986 Act.".</p></blockquote>
The Committee will see that the amendment is reasonable. Under the supplementary benefit regulations, if a disabled person were saving his mobility allowance to buy a car—which is an eminently sensible thing to do—or for other purposes that would increase his mobility, that money was disregarded and did not count as part of his capital. Many of the factors previously disregarded under the supplementary benefit regulations were reproduced in the income support regulations, but this for some inexplicable reason was not. The factors that continue to be disregarded are intimately analagous with that which we are proposing now, for example, personal possessions,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a car, furniture and fittings in your house, and family belongings are generally ignored in the calculation of capital."</p></blockquote>
The exception is where an item has been bought specifically to bring the capital amount below the level of the limit. Therefore, if a car itself is disregarded, the savings for it, which can be seen as deferred payments for it, should also be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other heading is "earmarked capital". If the capital for sale of a house is ear-marked for house purchase in future, it is ignored for up to six months, or longer in certain circumstances. Our amendment deals with a similar circumstance. People save their money to reduce their dependence on the state and thus increase their mobility. With the present price of cars, their capital could soon reach £6,000 and their entitlement to income support would be eliminated completely. This comes under thrift, one of the litany of virtues of which the Government approve. I shall be uncharacteristically brief in introducing the amendment because I have firm confidence that it will be accepted by the Minister with enthusiasm and gratitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I must disappoint the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), doubtless to the astonishment of the Committee. I have two reasons for doing so. First, when the mobility allowance was introduced, as the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
Gentleman has reminded us, this facility existed under the supplementary benefit regulations. Then the limit of capital that one was allowed to hold to qualify for supplementary benefit was £2,000. That was raised in due course to £3,000 and as a result of the reforms of the social security system in April 1988 it was doubled to £6,000. It would take some five years continuous saving of the mobility allowance to breach the £6,000 limit. There has been a substantial alteration in the amount of capital that can be held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second reason is simplicity. We want to treat the capital limits across the three income-related benefits as equally as we can. We want to retain the inherent simplicity of the schemes. Under the supplementary benefit system, there were great difficulties in deciding whether the amount of capital held by a claimant had been produced by savings from the mobility allowance or from other sources. Furthermore, it is difficult to make adjudication decisions about the source of the savings. In the light of those two reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, although first I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Simplicity was promised for the scheme and everyone has been greatly disillusioned by what was produced, even allowing for the immense complexity of the previous system. A rapid change in the capital allowance was made within months of the previous law coming into effect. The point has not been made that the sum involved will not be made up entirely from allowances paid for mobility. It is likely that the individuals involved will have other sums too, and that the small amount of savings will rapidly take them over the modest £3,000 limit. Many people have small nest eggs such as insurance policies. Income support is reduced if capital exceeds £3,000, although the first £250 is regarded as having an income of £1. The amount that people are saving to buy a car would rapidly put them over that limit if they have any assets as many people do. Those assets might come from, for example, from the sale of a house, a divorce settlement or an insurance policy. The Minister's response was disappointing because, as the proposal would be valuable to only a small number of people, the sum involved would be small and would not be an immense burden on the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain optimistic that good sense will prevail. We should allow the Minster some time to reconsider the figures. There was a slight disagreement between us earlier, which was resolved in my favour. If the Minister will give our proposal his mature consideration, he may in time agree to what is a blazingly reasonable mendment. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), I shall not detain the Committee for long. However, I take this opportunity to return to the matter raised by my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). I refer to the award of mobility allowance to people whose physical ability is not impaired, but whose mental capacity or behavioural problems may, in practice, impair their ability to use their limbs. I draw the Committee's attention to that point and to the Minister's remarks on the previous amendment, because, on Friday night at my advice bureau, a constituent came to me with precisely that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West said when we debated amendment No. 24, we hope to raise the matter on Report. I should like to put a further example in the arena so that the Minister can consider the matter afresh before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West that at present there is no need to change the law, but that guidance to the adjudicating authorities may be of assistance, and that some monitoring will take place. In our debate on 19 January, the Minister said that people who need physical support should qualify. He said that sensory deprivation and mental handicap can affect people's physical capacities and that evidence is now emerging that examining doctors take that into account when they assess walking ability. Later in the debate the Minister said that case law was already dealing with the purpose of the amendment to a considerable extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to the case of Denise Clayton, a constituent of mine. Denise is severely mentally handicapped, apparently as a result of being born with phenylketonuria. Her physical fitness is not particularly impaired, but, as the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham), said was the case in some of his examples, her mental handicap is increasingly affecting her capacity to use her physical abilities and prevents her from having mobility. She has become more and more withdrawn and unwilling to leave her home or have any social contact. The only time that she leaves home is if, with the greatest difficulty, her parents can persuade her to go out with them in their car. That is not an easy undertaking, and the whole family has to work at it for a long time. It is the only aspect of mobility that Denise currently enjoys, and that has been the case for a considerable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of Denise's condition which makes hers a particularly difficult case is that she is terrified of doctors. That does not help in assessing her physical or mental condition. I am grateful to the Department for its understanding in trying to obtain an assessment of Denise's condition. Nevertheless, she has just been refused mobility allowance on the ground that she is not physically unable, or virtually unable, to walk. Those are the straightforward conditions laid down, but no reference was made to her mental handicap, although I hope and presume that that was taken into account. I cannot summarise her case better than to say simply and bluntly what her father said to me on Friday night: she might as well not have legs, because they are not the slightest use to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all recognise the difficult considerations that the Department has to take into account, and I am not asking the Minister to put himself in the place of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
the tribunal. However, that is yet another case that casts doubt on whether case law is progressing and whether guidance is being considered in the way in which the Minister hopes. It raises the question whether the Department should not, at a later stage, consider an amendment along the lines of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the opportunity of this debate to insinuate some thoughts in the Minister's head. I welcome the clause, and I assume that there will be no move by the Opposition to vote against it. That would be a strange move and I would not support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the Minister has said. The main body of his argument is that he needs to study the OPCS review and to hold things in the balance. However, I recommend that he least consider the strong case for increasing the age limit at which one can apply from 65 to 70. If he is looking for suggestions, I hope that he will earnestly consider that. I do not know how much extra it would cost. It would be a small but significant step for the Government to contemplate taking it on board in their future deliberations. I say that because it is my experience in constituency cases and otherwise that people over the age of 70 begin to suffer from the general wear and tear of life in a way that, sadly, tends to render some people incapable of independent, free, painless movement. People at the back end of their 60s are invariably restricted in their movement because of some accident, mischance, disease or injury. There is a case for increasing the age limit to 70 for that reason if no other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some terrible potential anomalies. For example, I heard of a car crash in which a husband and wife were both severely injured and both suffered bad spinal damage. One of them was under 65 and the other was 67, so one was rendered eligible for mobility allowance and the other was not. Such anomalies are difficult to justify and the Minister could meet some of them, some of the complaints that have been raised and some of the experiences that I have come across as a constituency Member of Parliament if he would consider that extra five-year period during which people could make claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is whether the Department will give serious consideration to the publicity material that is made available to those who may potentially be eligible for mobility allowance. There is nothing more frustrating than, a year after losing his entitlement because he is too old, someone finding that he could have made a claim and would have qualified had he known about it. I know that the Department takes some steps to make the availability of the benefit known to potential claimants. More could be done, and I hope that the Minister will consider carefully what publicity material, leaflets and advertising the Department could take on to ensure that everyone entitled is advised and informed timeously so that they do not miss the benefit simply because they have run out of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon. Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
Kirkwood) and for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) have said. I shall consider the publicity, but the fact that mobility allowance has proved so popular and has expanded so rapidly in recent years is an indication that it is becoming much more generally known. However, if we can do more, I shall certainly consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we follow the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of adding another five years to the qualifying age, it would not prevent the anomalies that he mentioned, because people of 69 and 71 would be treated differently. That problem would remain with us wherever the line is drawn—if a line is to be drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are genuinely committed to monitoring the benefit and shall look at its shape in the aftermath of the OPCS reports. I hope that the hon. Member for Derby, South will write to me about this. I shall ensure that it is borne in mind when we consider the matter at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with people aged over 55 and below retirement age, who are unemployed, seeking work—these days one must really show that one is seeking work to be entitled to benefit—have paid their stamps, are entitled to unemployment benefit, but who also receive a small occupational pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
Under the Social Security Act 1988, anyone over the age of 55—it used to be 60, but that is another example of the Government whittling away people's rights and entitlements—who receives an occupational pension of more than £35 a week has the excess deducted from his or her unemployment benefit. Thus the Government penalise those who have had the foresight and luck to pay into an occupational pension. Despite the Government's rhetoric, it is better for people to spend their money and make no provision for old age. If they do so and are entitled to an occupational pension before full retirement age, the Government will penalise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments refer to the many people who are forced to retire early. In the west midlands many people have worked from the age of 14 or 15 to the age of 55. They were thrown out of employment during the great recession that was induced by the crude monetarism which was introduced after 1979. They have spend a lifetime of work and no one can question their willingness and desire to work. Moreover, they have had great difficulty in adjusting to unemployment. Those people are actively seeking work under the stringent requirement of the current provisions of restart and so on, which will be tightened even further under clauses 7 and 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members sit there, not listening—like lumps of lard, as we say in the west midlands—disconnected from the reality of ordinary human beings' lives. That is why I have picked out a letter which describes the kind of individuals who will be affected by this legislation. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am nearly sixty years old, and am an unemployed design engineering consultant. Since 1983, when my company stopped trading, I have been able to obtain only short-term contracts of a few months duration. In 1986 I decided to sell my home in Wembley and come to live in Somerset, which meant that I no longer had to have a mortgage, overdraft, etc."</p></blockquote>
he was trying to be responsible and not to be a burden on the state by claiming benefit. He went on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My wife, incidentally, has multiple sclerosis, and is confined to a wheelchair, and I have a war disablement pension, although I am fit and and able.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>My problem is that since my arrival in Minehead, the local Department of Employment has continually harassed me regarding my 'availablity for work' status. Initially, they stated that, as my wife was an invalid, I was not always available for work. I disputed this, because it was not true. They eventually accepted this. However, they are now stating that I am only prepared to accept a post as an engineering consultant or designer. This also is untrue, since I have filled in all the necessary forms, insisting that I will accept any job in this vicinity which I am mentally and physically capable of doing.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I may be wrong, but I have the feeling that I am being victimised. Perhaps others have the same actions taken against them, but in my case it has been unrelenting, for 18 months. Perhaps this is the policy which they now have to adopt, and if so,"—</p></blockquote>
I guess that this man is a Tory voter—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall have to accept it. I have tried for jobs over this whole area, and elsewhere, and have tried to get work at home, but all to no avail, and I am at a loss to know what else I should do."</p></blockquote>
That is just one of the many stories. Here is a responsible guy who lost his full-time job. We shall return to his harassment about availability for work later. This man has a one-year entitlement to unemployment benefit while looking for a job and is allowed to keep that benefit only if his occupational pension is less than £35 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
The provision flies in the face of the adjustments that we need to make in our benefit system to recognise the fact that we are all living longer. We must cease to think of a finite age when all work ceases with full retirement and think much more of flexible retirement people can make their own choices according to their health, needs and wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government allow retired people to keep their pension if they earn less than £75 a week. People who have been forced into early retirement, who have lost their full-time job but are still actively seeking work and who have made provision to receive an occupational pension are allowed to keep their unemployment benefit only if the occupational pension is less than £35 a week. That is grossly wrong and the Government should reconsider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee can choose from three amendments, depending on how mean the Government want to be about this. Amendment No. 12 suggests that the limit of occupational pension before loss of unemployment benefit should be £75 a week. That seems to make sense given that retired people who have a pension are entitled to keep £75 a week before their pension is lost. How come a woman aged over 60 or a man aged over 65 can keep £75 but a slightly younger man or woman can keep only £35? There is no sense in that. There is a strong case for treating both groups similarly. We have been promised that the £75 limit for pensioners will be phased out, but instead of that it has not been increased for three years. That does not arise from these amendments but it is unfair and an outrage. It illustrates the failure to adjust to the fact that people are living longer and want a phased and more flexible retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 increases the £35 limit that the Government introduced in 1980 in line with average earnings. We must keep benefits in line with the general standard of living in society and not allow pensioners and others to be left behind and impoverished. If the £35 limit were increased in accordance with the increase in average earnings it would be £66.50. The Government should accept £75 but if not there is a clear and logical case for accepting £66.50. This is a serious issue and something needs to be done. If the Government are consistent and behave as meanly as they have in the past about the uprating of pensions we would expect them to uprate the limit only in line with the movement in prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 26, one would be allowed to keep £53.50 a week of one's occupational pension before losing any unemployment benefit. The case for this is overwhelmingly clear. It is an issue about which Tory Back Benchers should be concerned. They always claim to speak, not for the poorest who did not have a chance to lay down occupational pensions, but for those who did. Now, when such people become unemployed, and actively seek work and jump through all the hurdles that Government have put in place—even the greater hurdles that will be a result of the Bill—they lose their entitlement to unemployment benefit because there is an unfair limit that has to not been uprated for many years. I am not as optimistic as my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), but I hope that the Government can make a concession on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 14 moves away from the specific figures proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). It suggests that we should build into the legislation a method of index-linking it, so that a future increase is built in at this stage and the figures do not become frozen and static. Amendment No. 14 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In subsection (1) of that section, at the end there shall be added the words 'increased each year to restore its value in relation to the general level of earnings in Great Britain'.".</p></blockquote>
The phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"general level of earnings in Great Britain"</p></blockquote>
is the language of the 1975 Act. It would require that the occupational pension limit above which unemployment benefit is abated should in future be increased each year in line with average earnings. Whatever that figure may be—whatever the Government would be prepared to concede—it is important that we ensure that it is not allowed to remain unaltered for years on end, as has happened since 1981. When the figure was introduced in April 1981, it was then related to the general level of earnings. This is a plea for that relationship to be restored. I am not asking for the whole scheme to be abolished. The amendment specifies that the annual increases should be in line with average earnings rather than prices. We have had this row before. The earnings index is more appropriate for this purpose because occupational pensions are based on pre-retirement earnings. In other words, the pensions of those paid by the final salary schemes will reflect the level of earnings at the time when they are awarded. That will not be the case with money-purchased pensions, including personal pensions to which the abatement will be extended by clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of the money-purchased pensions is totally unpredictable and cannot be set out in advance or built into legislation. No index of earnings, prices or anything else will be more likely than any other to produce the right answer. We ask that the earnings index become the monitor for the scheme in future. In December 1987 there was an attempt to raise the £35 limit, which the Minister turned down on grounds of cost. He said in Standing Committee at the time:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To commit ourselves to the uprating principle would tie the Government's hands in an important area in an undesirable way. It would be difficult to estimate the cost. It is much more sensible for the Government to be able to judge the cost year by year."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 8 December 1987;c.479.]</p></blockquote>
If the uprating principle is built into the earnings index, it is possible to estimate the cost and judge it year by year. Otherwise, it seems that under this legislation there is means testing for older unemployed people. I hope that the Minister will agree that the uprating principle is acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On cost, the Minister may say that it is a matter of budget priorities. If so, I hope that he will support this proposal as a priority rather than the other proposed measures such as increasing mortgage tax relief to make life easier for people who are suffering
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
as a result of the Chancellor's current policies, or providing tax relief for pensioners who have private health care. I hope that the Minister is prepared to accept this modest proposal before this other budget priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To talk about cost in this context is misleading. If the limit were uprated annually in line with earnings, there would be no cost at all. If anything, there would be a saving, because the value of occupational pensions can be expected to rise faster than earnings. So the number of people losing all or part of their unemployment benefit would increase year by year. In that way, the Government would make a saving. There would be a cost only in that the Treasury would no longer make an additional saving each year as a result of freezing the £35 limit and budgeting for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In December 1987, the Minister for Social Security said that such a proposal would tie his hands. It is not appropriate to negotiate every individual case every year. Such annual budgeting is not appropriate in many other areas of Government policy where payments are linked and there is a built-in framework of increases. The amendment suggests that the level of earnings can provide that increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the proposed higher figure, and that he will also accept the need, which is built in to the group of amendments, for increasing that figure regularly every year. Amendment No. 14 would simply provide the Government with the means of doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the rule is simple. Unemployment benefit has generally been regarded as compensation for loss of earnings for people who have unwillingly been deprived of work and wages. I do not believe that retirement at an appointed date which has been known in advance for years, after a long career and with a substantial pension, constitutes unemployment in quite the way the was intended under the national insurance scheme, when it was first created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be aware—perhaps he is not, because I sometimes wonder what goes on in a Tory advice bureau—that many people who have been thrown out of work before they planned to leave, negotiate with their pension scheme and are given the choice of taking some of the pension earlier because of their circumstances, but it is less than it would have been had they continued working. The sum of slightly more than £35 a week is not a substantial pension. Will the Minister please talk about the real world and real people, not those who take planned, highly rewarded retirement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real world is somewhat more complicated than the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) has suggested. Many people with an occupational pension scheme retire when their scheme comes to fruition. They know that date in advance; it is at the end of their working life. Of course, there are people who are obliged to retire earlier and as the hon. Lady said, after negotiations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
and adjustments, their benefit may not be as much as it would have been if the pension scheme had gone to full term. But the rule is that the trigger begins at £35, only when there is an income of that level from the occupational scheme. Only then does it begin to abate the unemployment benefit. The trigger is £35, and it has remained so since the rule was introduced in 1981. At present, unemployment benefit for a couple is not extinguished until the pension rises to £88 a week. That amount will increase because the figure is not simply static, as the hon. Lady suggested; the amount increases as unemployment benefit rises. There is total extinction at £88 now; from next April, it will be £91.10 a week, so movement is built into the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that was taken by the National Insurance Advisory Committee at the end of the 1960s. It pointed out that circumstances were changing. When the rules were established, few people retired on an occupational pension scheme, and it was suggested that there was an anomaly. The Labour Government of the time accepted that and put down regulations in 1970. The fact that those regulations were lost due to the general election was not the immediate fault—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister remind me of that date? Did he say that the report was issued in 1968?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it was 1968. The regulations were laid down by the Labour Government in 1970, just before the election, and they were lost with the election. But the Government retained the general view that the report was correct, because they re-introduced regulations in 1976. I believe they were lost that time as a result of an internal rebellion in the Labour party, so I accept that, within the Labour party, there are differences of opinion on the matter. However, as a point of general principle, this Government agree with the two previous Labour Governments in accepting that the National Insurance Advisory Committee had a good point. The question at issue, reflected in the amendments, is the point at which the trigger should be set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 12, which was moved by the hon. Member for Ladywood, would raise the figure at which entitlement is extinguished from £88 a week to £128 a week. I think that she based that on the £75 earning rule for the retirement pensions because she explained it. I understand the argument, but it is erroneous. Under the earnings rule, pension is abated or lost when a pensioner is working and earning more than £75 a week. The clause provides for an occupational or personal pensioner who is not employed, so the parallel is not a good one. However, I accept that it is properly argued in relation to amendments Nos. 13 and 26, because the increase to £66.50 under amendment No. 13 is connected with the rise in earnings since 1980 or 1981. That would take the £88 to £119.50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister does not want to play games by quoting the upper limit and distorting figures. The £66 is the lower limit. Would he like to spell out the way in which the money is lost pound for pound between £66.50 and whatever
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
he said—£118, perhaps—rather than constantly referring to the upper limit and pretending that the Government have been more generous than they are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Lady has said it quite clearly, and so have I. After abatement, an occupational pensioner couple with a high enough pension—over £35—will be left with £88 a week. I am trying to stress that it is not as small a figure as the hon. Lady implied. She spoke of £35, but such a pensioner couple would have £88.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is giving those figures, will he also say at what level the £35 was extinguished when it was first introduced in 1980, and to what that figure has been uprated? He is not comparing like with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not comparing the 1980 and 1981 figures, and cannot immediately give the hon. Lady that figure. I am talking about the current situation and the situation after next April. I am not making a direct connection and saying that the value has been maintained since 1980–81, because it has not. We have left the figure as it was. The hon. Members for Birmingham, Ladywood and for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) would accept that someone with an occupational pension over £35 and an adult dependant would have an income from his pension and from unemployment benefit of £88 per week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never understood one part of the Government's argument. Will the Minister explain why those whose resources take the form of investment income rather than occupational pensions are not subject to the means test if they become unemployed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because, as I said earlier, the income stems directly from an occupational pension scheme. A pension is paid at the termination of the employment during which contributions have been made to a pension scheme. The pension comes into play only because that employment has stopped, whereas income from investment, savings and other sources can be enjoyed whether or not a person is working. We are talking about pensions that are paid when people have completed the career during which the pension has been earned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—especially as I did not hear all of the Minister's preceding remarks—but that is not all that we are talking about. I accept that in some cases, people will have come to the end of their full working life and will be drawing their pension. Even in some of those cases, such as the police or fire services, part of the contract for an occupational pension scheme requires most people to retire at the age of 55. Should they subsequently have difficulty in finding employment, they would be entitled to benefit at the full rate, without abatement of their occupational pension. Last year, the Government unilaterally changed that scheme without consultation and in the face of considerable opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) said, substantial numbers of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
people are unfortunately forced into redundancy and early retirement. They have drawn on their occupational pension not because that is in their best, long-term, financial interests but because they need the money to help them to keep body and soul together. They are already losing out from their occupational pension scheme because, as the Minister will readily appreciate, they will get nothing like the pension now. They are paying the penalty for having had to take redundancy or early retirement. Many of those people will have reached nowhere near the end of their careers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that that will be true of many people who retire and negotiate with their company their entitlement under the pension scheme, but the majority know when they will retire from their company scheme. The hon. Member for Derby, South painted the picture of members of the police force joining the pension scheme and calculating that they will receive a year's unemployment benefit at the end of their employment. I do not believe that they make such a calculation. If a calculation is made, it is that they must retire at 55, will probably get—as most do—a different job, and will enjoy that pension unabated, because it is unaffected by other earnings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all understand that, but if they are unfortunate enough, as many will be in the present climate of employment, not to find employment they would expect to be able to draw unemployment benefit, like any other citizen expected to do until last year. The Minister is omitting from his rewriting of history the fact that if those same people who retire from the police or fire service, obtain further employment but are made redundant two, three or four years later they will have had to pay extra contributions for those years after 55 but will still not be able to draw unemployment benefit. If they get another job they will again be expected to pay contributions but will not earn a right to unemployment benefit. The Minister can describe that any way he likes but he cannot make it just.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of how one views the role of unemployment benefit and the nature of occupational and now personal pension schemes. Circumstances have changed a great deal since unemployment benefit was introduced and developed. All those changes make the £35 abatement rule much more sensible and fair. It now corresponds with what most people regard as the purpose of unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few minutes ago I was asked how the present position compared with 1981 when the first abatement was introduced. Unemployment benefit was then £32 and, 10p for 10p, it would mean that with the £35 allowance all entitlement to benefit would extinguish at £67. Now it is £88. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that there is no movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two points were made. One, which I did not entirely follow, was made by the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
Leeds, West. He suggested that if an increase in line with earnings each year was built into the rules, the Treasury would benefit. It is always interesting to know of potential benefits to the Treasury but the reason why there is no change here is not that it would be expensive so much as that there are better ways of directing resources than to a group who are well advantaged compared with others who want a job and cannot get one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would not be a cost to the Treasury if the limit were uprated annually because the value of the occupational pension would be expected to rise faster than earnings. It would thus float people out of the unemployment benefit scheme: they would lose their entitlement to unemployment benefit and move up out of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not consider that that would be a saving compared with keeping the figure at £35 as it is at present. I will read what the hon. Gentleman said in 
	<i>Hansard</i> and see whether I can follow his point then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is linked to the level of earnings and the value of occupational pensions rises faster than earnings a saving is obviously made because people are floated out of unemployment benefit at the other end. If it is linked to earnings a saving will almost certainly be made otherwise something is going radically wrong with the pensions market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his clarification. The other point—about means tests for unemployment benefit—was made by the hon. Member for Ladywood. I hope that she will forgive me if I misheard her, but I think that she suggested that there should be, or that we were about to introduce, means tests for unemployment benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not use the phrase—my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) did. There is a means test in the system. A means test is built in in that up to a certain level of occupational pension a person can keep his unemployment benefit but not beyond. My hon. Friend used the phrase in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. In 1980, when the regulation for 1981 was brought in, we based our judgment on the circumstances of people who, by and large—I know that—members of some schemes who retire earlier—retire at a planned age from a business or career and consequently receive a substantial income in excess of £35. I appreciate that arguments can be made for figures other than £35. I could make them myself. One can also argue for less than £35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister deals with the figures again, I should like to clarify a point. The Minister has stressed the issue as he sees it. Early retirement, to use his phrase, is the crucial issue. Would the Minister still think it reasonable to make the deduction if the person was "actively seeking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
employment" and therefore clearly not retired? That is the reality as described by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would be retired from the job which produced his pension. It is a special situation. It is easy to adapt it to suit one's argument but it is difficult to get away from the argument that the payments are made because work for a particular job for a number of years has ceased. The payments continue because of a right that was earned during that job. That is quite different from the normal unemployed person. Having said that, I agree that it is a matter of judgment at what point one places that trigger. It has been at £35 since 1980. I can see arguments for it being different. I can see theoretical arguments for it being less and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, with his ingenious mind, could also make a valid theoretical argument for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not suggest that that is the way we see it. It is our job to look each year at the level. This year, like last year and the year before, we do not feel justified, in view of the other priorities— 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> An extra £2.50 and £3.50 is coming in in October for older and disabled pensioners on income support. That is a good example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the pensioners who will get the extra money in October are deeply grateful to the Minister. Will he now introduce a new uprating of that figure because of the latest inflation figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, those are decided annually on the rate of inflation at the appropriate time. If there is an extra upwards blip in inflation, the benefit comes through on the due date. If it goes downwards, that is taken into account in the same way. None of those movements in the inflation rate are ever missed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could cast his mind back to the decision that his Government took in 1980 to break the link with earnings. Pensioners are still being penalised because of that callous decision nine years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument is not strictly within the bounds of the clause so that I would be brought to order if I pursued it. We said before the general election that we would attach the uprating to the level of inflation. We have done that. Indeed, we have done rather better than that. Secondly, what matters to pensioners is their overall income. Under this Government, pensioners' average total income has risen much faster than it did under the Labour Government, which the hon. Gentleman presumably supported. The real interests of pensioners are better served by what has happened since 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is probably the last intervention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the debate carries on too far down that track—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting, but it is drifting away slightly. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to distract the Committee from the subject, and I support the Chair in this matter. The Minister has left one point unclear—it may be minor to him, but it is major to me. The rate of inflation for pensioners is higher than the retail price index, as that includes items that are not necessarily major items purchased by old age pensioners. The pensioners' index shows a higher rate of inflation than the retail price index. Therefore, not only did the Government break the link with earnings in 1980, but they have disregarded advice from many organisations that they should consider the pensioner's and poor person's index rather than the ordinary retail price index. I wish that the Minister would come clean and admit that the Government are seeking to devalue the pension rather than increase it in real terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will call me to order if I pursue the hon. Gentleman down this path, Mr. McWilliam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not call the Minister to order if he pursues the hon. Gentleman down that path. It is one thing to argue about the level of state pensions and quite another to argue about the cost of the amendment to pensioners in general, which is quite in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is right. The inflation rate at present has been increased particularly because of higher mortgage interest payments, which most pensioners do not have to pay. Before the hon. Member for Ladywood tells me that there are some pensioners—particularly those at 55—who are still paying off their mortgage, I admit that that is so. However, the inflation rate exaggerates rather than under-estimates the increased cost to most pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we should argue only when there are differences in opinion and not get muddled about the facts, the Minister must know that various studies are done of the consumption patterns of people at different income levels. Pensioners and others at low income levels have a different pattern of consumption, and so the inflation rate for them is different. Indices are produced by various academics. The low pay unit used to produce them, and it is now producing another. It shows that in recent years, before inflation took off again as it has now, for poorer people the inflation rate was higher than the inflation rate registered in the retail price index. Those are the facts, and the Minister must know that. I hope that he will confirm them so that we do not argue unnecessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have differences of opinon as to what the costs are, and how they have moved, but, as I said in answer to the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn), total pensioner incomes—not pensions—have risen faster under this Government than before, and faster than earnings in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
We are talking about occupational pensioners who are in receipt of a substantial occupational income, and they cannot be bracketed with the poorer pensioners. There is an increase due next October in the income support for poorer pensioners, who have a particular call upon the public purse, which is why we are making these adjustments to the income support levels for them. We are not proposing to move the £35 figure this year. However, we consider the figure each year. Bearing in mind our other priorities, we would not be justified in using resources to increase still further the advantages undoubtedly already enjoyed by those with substantial occupational pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detect that the Minister is more uncomfortable about the amendment than he has been about anything else today. I have listened to his defence in my normal objective manner, and he is losing by a long margin. I understand the differences of opinion about how to treat occupational pension income and the argument about deferred earnings. However, Committee members should bear in mind the fact that he has omitted to mention that people who receive occupational pensions will have paid not only national insurance contributions in order to qualify for unemployment benefit, but tax on their occupational pensions. They pay every way and still have their benefit docked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister thinks that people plan on the basis that they will get abated unemployment benefit, he is quite wrong. In my experience, people are surprised if they are unfortunate enough to be hit by that. I have had one or two cases, but not many, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) has had more, because she has a bigger electorate, and one that is probably proportionately more troubled than mine. Severe difficulties are caused, and the Government are quite wrong to treat occupational pension incomes simply as deferred earnings. They should be put to one side and abatement should not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a perfectly logical argument for increasing the £35 to £75 as the amendment suggests. There is no argument for not indexing the £35. If I understood the Minister correctly, he said that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) could, if he put his mind to it, come up with a theoretical argument for reducing that figure. That thought defeats me entirely. It would cost some £5 million, or £10 million if he went back to the 55-year qualification and the hon. Member for Ladywood said that a cut had been made by increasing the age to 60. It would cost only some £5 million to index the £35 from the 1981 figure to the figure that we are discussing. That would satisfy me although it might not satisfy other members of the Committee, including the Member for Ladywood, and I would understand that. If the Minister had said, "OK, fair dos, we shall index it. The threshold will go up according to the retail price index", I would settle for that and he could sustain his argument. Instead, he has stonewalled the Opposition's proposals, based on the amendment,
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
and I am not surprised that he looks uncomfortable. I know that in his heart of hearts he is uncomfortable because one does not sit through Standing Committees for hours watching Ministers carefully without detecting the nuances of how they feel about what they are given. He knows that he is on a sticky wicket, and should do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the remarks of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I think we all have some sympathy with the Minister who is seeking, unsuccessfully, to defend the utterly indefensible. I remind the Committee that the Minister had a range of options from which to choose. They were ably set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood and the least of them was to index the limit in line with prices. The Government will choose none of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the advice of the national advisory committee, given as long ago as 1968–69, on people drawing substantial occupational pensions who had completed the full term not just of contracts that might not take them up to retirement age, but of contracts that would normally take them up to a more general retirement age—usually the age of at least 60, and certainly not as low as 55. In those circumstances, the committee advised consideration of whether people should be able to draw unemployment benefit when they are fully retired and not attempting to look for work, as opposed to being unemployed. Of course, that was a period of fuller employment than has ever been enjoyed under this Government and the existing legislation. It was much simpler then to conclude that when someone who had had a well-paid professional job all his life reached 60 or 62, he was properly retired. It is different now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that when people who work for the police and fire services reach the end of their contracts at the age of 55, that is the decision of society rather than the decision of the individual involved. However, I do not believe that anyone, including the Minister, envisages that those people retire then. They are expected to look for work and they expect to look for work. We all hope that they are successful in obtaining other work. They are not retired at all. They have simply, through society's decision—perhaps unwillingly—left the job in which they may have spent a substantial part of their adult lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that unemployment benefit was intended for those unwillingly deprived of work and wages. One could not better describe the position of people forced to take early retirement or redundancy who then have to draw their occupational pension. They do not have substantial pensions, as the Minister suggested, but because they have so little entitlement to income of any kind, they are forced to act against what is undoubtedly their best interests, to and draw on their occupational pension. That is to their long-term disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that a couple of our comparisons were invalid. He made great play of the fact that although the extinction begins to bite at £35, the entitlement to benefit is not wholly extinguished
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
until £88 has been reached. When I challenged him to tell us how that compared with the reality of the situation, he was quick to say that he was not making a direct comparison—and very wise that was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood him to say that when the provision was originally introduced, full entitlement was extinguished at £67. He did not tell us what that would be in today's prices. Judging by the other figures that we have heard, I believe that on a straight comparison with today's prices, entitlement would be extinguished at about £100 or £102, which is substantially higher than the Minister's figure. He was quite right to be careful and say that he was not making a straight comparison. Not only have the Government frozen at £35 the figure at which entitlement begins to be lost, but they may even have worsened the position on the range of income over which benefit entitlement is extinguished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made another point which I thought was wholly misplaced and misguided when discussing amendment No. 12, which deals with those who are fully retired and drawing their retirement pension, and are allowed to earn £75. The Minister said that that was not a fair point because the amendment dealt with those who were by definition, retired and were in work and it was wrong to make the same provision for those who were unemployed. He mentioned earnings from work. First, I feel sure that the Minister will concede that the whole point of the provision is that occupational pensions are treated as earnings. We are comparing like with like—occupational pensions are being treated as earnings and earnings are being treated as earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also suggested that fully retired people drawing their full state pension who are lucky enough after 60 or 65 to get work are allowed to earn £75 will be doing substantially better than those who are not in work and who are allowed only this abatement for £35. Therefore, the Minister is saying that people who draw a pension and have a job are treated at least twice as generously as those who may have been forced into early retirement and have no job. May I gently remind the Committee that the figure of £75 has not been uprated for several years? In that sense, we are comparing like with like. This is yet another area where the Government, despite their promises, have chosen to make savings at the expense of people in retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which the Minister presented his case implied that £35 was too generous in 1980.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Minister then strayed into suggesting that if we were unwise enough to say that £35 was not the right level, the Government might reduce it. Perhaps he was right to warn us, as the Government's natural inclination is to cut rather than improve benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, the Minister seemed to be unable to make a case for anything except leaving the £35 limit where it stands and where it has stood since 1981. This provision applies only to people who are unfortunate enough to receive their extra income
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
from occupational pensions. Successive Governments have encouraged them to save through that means. Similar or much more substantial incomes from investments that are not in the form of occupational pensions will not be affected one jot. This is not a matter of treating people on the same level of income in the same way; the provision will hit people who have saved through occupational or, in this case, personal pension schemes, simply because that is an easy and convenient way for the Government to save money. It is utterly indefensible and the Minister has failed to defend it. To be fair to him, nobody could defend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is at least decent enough to be embarrassed. First, he said that people who deliberately retire early with a substantial pension should not be entitled to unemployment benefit, but we are not talking about such people. An uncle of mine is doing just that: he is an accountant who has taken out an extra pension and is planning to retire early. Does anyone think that he would put himself through the humiliation of attempting to prove that he is available for work? Such a process now involves a system of pure humiliation, with restart forms, enormous questions, and letters questioning one's entitlement. People are humiliated even if they want only to receive stamps to see them through to retirement, because they receive income for their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about that group of people, and it is a fabrication to pretend that we are. They would not be willing to go through the system of proving that they were available for work, let alone actively seek to obtain the provisions in the Bill. So the Minister cannot hide behind that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point should really make the Minister squirm. If £35 was the right limit in 1980–81, how can he possibly justify allowing it to be eroded? For the reasons that we have already given, £75 would be a better limit. If someone who has just retired needs that amount of money and is allowed to have his pension as well, why does not someone who is just a few years younger also need it? Even if the Minister does not agree with our argument, it is indefensible for him to say that £35 was right in 1980–81 but should now shrivel away so that that group of people is annually worse off. We saw the Minister squirm, and he said that there is a case for increasing the amount of money that that group of people can keep, but that there are other priority groups, such as disabled people. Let us be clear about the Government's other priorities. They say that they cannot accept one of our amendments because of the pressure on their priorities for other groups of people.

In 
	<i>The Observer</i> last week, William Keegan referred to a study published by the Child Poverty Action Group called "Changing Tax":
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the best explanations of the tax system under Thatcher comes in a new work by John Hills, of the London School of Economics. He analyses the combined effects of changes in tax and social security over the past 10 years, and finds that 'the cuts in direct taxes, have been entirely paid for by cuts in the generosity of benefits'. There has thus been 'a major redistribution from

	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
those on low incomes to the better off, with the bottom 50 per cent, of families losing an average of £8.50 a week, while the top 10 per cent, have gained nearly £40 a week per family. By comparison with what would have happened if the 1978–79 tax and benefit levels had been uprated in line with the growth of national income, Mr. Hills states, 'the bottom half of the population has lost £6.6 billion, of which £5.6 billion has gone to the top 10 per cent.; indeed, £4.8 billion has gone to the top 5 per cent."</p></blockquote>
Let us keep clear the fact that the Government's priorities are that they will not look after this group of people with occupational pensions who are seeking to get work before they retire, because they want to give more and more money to some of the richest people in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to an important point. Is she aware that the figures she quotes from John Hills in the Child Poverty Action Group study are a serious understatement, particularly for people in inner city areas, where rent increases for council tenants have been very high and are likely to be higher in the next two or three years? The efforts of the previous Social Security Bill to reduce the housing benefit available to people in real terms because of high rents means that the loss of income to people on low incomes in urban areas is even greater than she suggests. She is dealing solely with national taxation and benefit figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The rent levels for council housing now are horrendous. People who get full housing benefit are protected. People with a better income buy now. The group is trapped; older low paid workers who cannot get any help are paying full council house rents, which are very high. My hon. Friend is right, and that is an additional factor that is not taken into account in those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister, is there any hope of any rationality in processes in the House these days? Does what we say in these Committees matter at all? If it does, the Minister should undertake to consider the matter again, at least to uprate the £35 limit so that it is worth as much as it was when the Government laid it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that does not occur, this is merely a crude process of ignoring any argument, statistics and justice and ripping away from the less well off in our society more and more in order to give it to the better off. The Government may as well stand up and admit that that is what they are about. We all ought to consider whether it is worth participating in the farce of discussing matters as if the Government were capable of being persuaded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pick up a few points that have been made by the three previous speakers, although not all of them, as many were repetitions of points that had been made before and on which I have commented. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) appears to believe that there should be no abatement at all, although that view is not taken up in any of the amendments in the group. I think that he is mistaken, but he could repeat his arguments in the next group of amendments, as they virtually produce that result.
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
When it comes to the use of resources, it is right not to make changes that especially assist those among the unemployed who are better off than most because they have the benefit of an occupational pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South referred to amendment No. 12, which I suggested made a less logical connection between the £75 earnings rule and the uprating of the £35 abatement of unemployment benefit. The hon. Lady half answered her own question. A rule that reduces the amount of pension to which a person is entitled because of earnings elsewhere is different from a rule that applies to those who, at the end of a period of work and as a result of contributions made during that time, receive a substantial pension. If the hon. Lady wants to make a comparison about generosity and otherwise, she should look at the abatement to which unemployment benefit is subject when an unemployed person earns. That limit is £2 a day. Although the £35 has not changed from what it was in 1981, is still generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ladywood made a general point about tax and benefit levels. That brings us to an argument that is well outside the subject of the amendments. I can understand that it has some bearing on the view that she takes of them and that which I take of them. The speed of growth in the economy over the past few years owes a considerable amount to the tax and benefit changes that she criticises. She will not accept that, but that is what the Government believe. Before we came to office, we said that such changes would have a dynamic effect on the economy, and the progress of the economy has demonstrated that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the country be said to have a successful economy when more than half the population is getting worse off? The Minister says that he needs more inequality to get more economic growth. If the economic growth of the Government is averaged out it is no better than that of preceding Governments. It was terribly bad at first and improved a bit more rapidly for a time. Is it economic growth and is it progress if nearly half our population is becoming worse and worse off? That is the Government's dilemma. Our society is becoming increasingly divided and impoverished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It would not be a success if that were the result, but that is not the result. The benefits of growth in the economy are widely spread. I would not deny for a moment that plenty of matters need further attention, which they will receive. If we return to the growth that the hon. Lady's Government achieved before we came into office, a larger number of people will be very much worse off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting a little wide. This is not a general debate on the state of the economy compared with the state of the economy under previous Governments.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand your guidance Mr. McWilliam. Let me return to the cost of the amendment. The Minister was talking about the different priorities. I have calculated roughly—fag packet stuff as usual, which is all that Opposition Members can manage—that it will cost about £5 million to index this £35 threshold from its 1981 value. The Chancellor of the Exchequer sits on a surplus in the public account of £15,000 million. Where is the priority there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The surplus and what it is prudent and sensible for the economy to spend are quite different. I will not pursue the hon. Gentleman down that track. If he does not understand the point, I shall be ruled out of order if I try to educate him now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can explain why it is prudent and sensible to spend £1 million publicising the Secretary of State for Health and his Minister of State but it is not prudent to spend not much more on a measure of this kind, which will stop saving being discouraged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on my right hon. Friend's decisions on that because I do not know the detailed arguments that he used. It is clearly a matter of judgment rather than principle or something that can be established by a set of rules, and I am sure that his judgment is right, as we are right to retain the figure of £35 as the point at which abatement is triggered, rather than move it to £40 or £32. It seems sensible in the circumstances to keep it there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolute nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not absolute nonsense. I make my final point, which I have made twice before, for a third time because it underlines the Government's position. We are not stuck fast on the point of £35 and I have been endeavouring to tell the Committee, and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire in particular, that it is a figure that we look at each year. There is certainly hope for future years and I should not like the hon. Gentleman to leave the Committee thinking that our decision not to uprate it or change it this year means that it will never be changed. That is a matter for judgment next year. He may hold me and the Government to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will look carefully at the figure and in the light of all the other pressures on budgets and of other requirements, will make their decision. We have not done so this year because, as I have already said, in view of other priorities it does not seem right at this time to use resources to increase still further the advantage undoubtedly enjoyed by a group that already has a substantial occupational pension and is not among those to whom the hon. Member for Ladywood sympathetically and understandably referred as being among the poorest. The point is that they are not among the poorest and that is why we decided to leave the figure as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
bogusly registering themselves for employment when they have left a job with a pension and being allowed to draw unemployment pay when they are not really looking for work at all? I think that it is and that there is a loophole that is meant to be plugged. People should not be entitled to benefit at all if they are already on a pension, although I know that they are. If they need extra money because their pension is inadequate, they can to to other forms of supplementary benefit. Does the clause deal with some other abuse of the system?

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not want to stop the hon. Lady, but her question is really appropriate to the stand part debate. Having looked at the amendment, it seems perfectly reasonable that we have such a debate, so may I suggest that it would be better for her to put it then, rather than while we are debating this group of amendments, which deal purely with the abatement resulting from occupational pensions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for that correction, Mr. McWilliam, but all the same it is awfully confusing to sit here for half the morning debating a clause of which one does not quite understand the significance.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I think that we have a problem in that the hon. Lady is referring to an amendment and calling it a clause.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) is referring to an amendment or a clause, her point is a substantive one.

Therefore, I would have thought that the Minister should reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) within your ruling, Mr. McWilliam.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause to which the amendment applies is to extend to personal pensions the rule that abated unemployment benefit for those who were in receipt of occupational pensions. The rule applied equally to those who were seeking hard for work and to those who put their name down as available for work, but rather hoped that none would turn up. The clause is not in any way plugging a loophole. It is intended to extend the rule that presently exists for occupational pensions to personal pensions that have been available since last July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should applaud the extremely accurate description that the Minister gave his hon.

He has made it even more clear to his own Benches that all his talk about whether people are retired is so much hogwash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is about the extension of a principle that we find objectionable and are seeking to amend. The principle in the clause is that people who are looking for work should nevertheless be denied unemployment benefit although they might, for the same period, still be required to pay contributions.

	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 4, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In subsections (1) and (6) of that section, for '55' there shall be substituted '64', and in subsection (6), for 'fifty-fifth' there shall be substituted 'sixty-fourth'.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to raise the age limit from 55 to 64 so that, although people may receive
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
occupational pensions, they may also receive unemployment benefit. When the Minister was challenged about the reasons for setting the age limit at 55, during a sitting of the committee considering the Social Security Bill in 1987, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only defence that I have is that the 55 age limit, like the previous 60 age limit, is arbitrary. There are people on both sides of the line. I accept the need for tidiness and overall fairness, but our intention in the clause is to concentrate the benefits that are available on those who need them most. It is a logical and defensible age for us to have taken for the purpose."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 8 December 1987; c. 455.]</p></blockquote>
Either the age 55 limit is arbitrary or it is logical and defensible. It cannot be both. In the absence of any better defence since that date, we must conclude that it is arbitrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic of the amendment is that an age limit of 64 would affect only men in the year before they reach the state pension age. Having lost their employment and become entitled to an occupational pension, they may not be particularly anxious to find another job in the short period that remains before they are entitled to state pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument has been put more than once. Indeed, in the debate that I have just quoted, my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it is the Government's intention to concentrate help on those who are in greatest need, it is irrelevant to have the age barrier, unless the Minister produces information to show different levels of income for different age groups."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 8 December; c. 455–456.]</p></blockquote>
In reply, the Minister simply repeated that it was an arbitrary line to take a step in the direction of concentrating the help to those in the greatest need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason to suppose that an unemployed person aged 55 is less in need of unemployment benefit than an unemployed person under 55. It is unjust if not cruel that, after many years of contributing to the scheme, he or she is not entitled to unemployment benefit. The Government have always argued that they are depriving one group of people of benefits that they have earned on the grounds that they are concentrating such funds on those who need them most. That may sound all right, but there is no evidence that those savings have gone to the neediest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report by Professor A. B. Atkinson and John Micklewright published last year by the International Centre for Economics and Related Disciplines identifies 38 significant changes made since 1979 in benefits for the unemployed. The vast majority of those were cuts rather than improvements, so the Government cannot back up their argument that some people will not receive benefit but that others will. They are clearly keeping the money for themselves, for whatever reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people are entitled to full unemployment benefit. They often need it because, five years before they are entitled to a state pension, they find themselves without a job. To refuse to give them benefit is cruel and does not cushion the unexpected disaster that has befallen them. It cannot even be justified on the ground that the Government are short of money. The money is there. They stash it away and refuse to pay it to those who we believe are entitled to it.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
That is hardly likely to encourage people to get a decent pension scheme and not to live on the state. Those who have decided to pay into such a pension scheme find that they are not only denied unemployment benefit but penalised through their taxes. A constituent of mine receives an occupational pension and has a few bits of savings and is now paying over 41 per cent, tax, which is more than Sir Ralph Halpern who pays only 40 per cent. tax. What a way to thank people who have taken on the responsibility to help themselves in their old age. The only people who seem to be exempt from this restriction are those who invest and can receive an income from their investment. Ordinary people with ordinary pensions are not so lightly dealt with. We ought to press the Government not to find money that is not there but to pay out the money that these people have contributed over the years and let them have some justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last group of amendments were the soft attack on the Government's position, and contained proposals to ameliorate the £35 rule. The amendment would negate the position that the Government have adopted, and contradict what the National Insurance Advisory Committee recommended in the late 1960s. Although the previous two Labour Governments took this on board, for one reason or another, they were unable to do anything about recognising that the position was, and is, changing. It changed with the growth of occupational pensions. People are in receipt of substantial pensions not merely at the time when they come to state retirement level but earlier—some at 60 years of age and quite a number at 55. Hence the adjustment that the Government made in the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognised from the quotation given by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) the careful, fluent and accurate words of my hon. Friend the Minister of State. The hon. Gentleman took some exception to the word "arbitrary". He should not have done so because my hon. Friend always uses his terms carefully and exactly, possibly a little archaically. He used the word arbitrary in the sense that the decision derives from common sense and judgment rather than a disembodied principle. Last year he took into account the fact that many more people retire with an occupational pension and that these pensions come to fruition at earlier dates. The amendment cannot be accepted because a change has come which makes it more necessary to make these adjustments earlier and have the abatement at the earliest time because many more people are involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that more and more people are retiring at 55 under occupational pension schemes. I am sure that the Minister would agree that the logic is that we should lower the retirement age to 55.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because I do not think that everyone wants to retire. We are talking about unemployment benefit. We are not obliging people to stay retired. We are saying that if they have not got a job and are in receipt of a substantial
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
occupational or personal pension after a point—the point at issue in the previous group of amendments—their unemployment benefit should be abated. I do not think that we want to lower retirement ages as a result of that. That is a live issue, although not one for discussion here. All I can give the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley is the answer that I know that he must have been expecting, if not from when he came to the Committee Room this morning, then at least since the previous debate—that the Government find this unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only repeat for the fourth time that when people are in receipt of a substantial occupational or personal pension, it is right that benefit should be abated. It is a question of what level, and we keep that regularly under review. However, the fact that it should be abated is a principle to which we should hold. The amendment would prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether, since the previous Bill, the Government have spent any time considering our predictions. As people are likely to lose certain benefits through occupational pension schemes, the best idea is not to have such a scheme but to invest that money and get the income from some other source.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not the best idea, because the occupational pension scheme that begins to be drawn, say, from the age of 55 is available for the rest of the individual's life. We are talking only about unemployment benefit during the 312 days for which it would normally have been available under the present rules. It is a denial of the full unemployment benefit rate during a narrow period, but there is no doubt that every individual in receipt of an occupational pension has made a good investment that will last him for the rest of his life. It is because it is a good investment that those people are not among the poorest of the unemployed. Therefore, not to abate benefit is not to assist those who need help most. The resources that could be directed towards them are not well directed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit casual. What sums of money are we talking about? Would the cost be met from the surplus in the national insurance fund? How many people are retiring with fat pensions that take them out of the category of needing full or abated unemployment benefit? Perhaps by the end of the century, the scenario that the Minister says exists could come about. Once personal and occupational pensions properly mature, he may have a stronger case. The Government's argument is ahead of its time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be prepared to consider the issue further down the track when the occupational—particularly the personal—pension schemes have properly matured. However, to say casually that folk do not need the allowance, and not to say how much it would cost if we implemented the amendment, is more casual than the standard of service that we came to expect in 1986. Ministers in charge of the committee then would attend with their homework
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
properly done and tell us how much the amendments would cost.

The amendment deserves serious consideration. If the Government think that they are getting away for all time with the standpoint that they have adopted since they reduced the age to 55, they are wrong. These are valid arguments that become more valid the more money the Treasury has available to expend. Prioritising and targeting of benefit becomes less of a tenable standpoint for the Government if there is £15 billion across the road in the Treasury coffers available for expenditure. How much would the proposal cost to implement? What facts and figures do the Government have that enables them to send Ministers to Committees such as this and take such a hard, intransigent line against a perfectly reasonable and logical proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point on which I agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). The Government are frequently ahead of their time. They are certainly ahead of Opposition Members, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about figures and chided me for not producing any. There are figures, but the debate does not hinge on them, as we are discussing a matter of principle—that it is wrong to abate unemployment benefit because of an occupational personal pension, whatever its size. I questioned the hon. Gentleman on that point during our last debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at the figures and two of them have stuck in my mind. Moving the age limit on abatement last year from 60 to 55 meant that, in total, it affected about 45,000 occupational pensioners at a cost of about £65 million. That shows the kind of league that the figures are in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained to my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay, the clause refers to personal pensions, which will be included for the first time, but for the foreseeable future, the effect will be negligible in financial terms, because it will take time for those pensions to build up. So it will take a long time to affect someone who has retired or ceased work on a personal pension, even if the figure remains at £35 a week. It is a matter of principle and knowing what is right rather than of figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fag packet arithmetic is the order of the day among Opposition Members, as we have access to no better information. The Minister mentioned £65 million, which sounds like an awful lot of money. I may be wrong, so will the Minister circulate a note to all members of the Committee telling us how he arrived at that figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman would like that information, I shall first check whether the figures are accurate. If they need any minor adjustment up or down, I shall let members of the Committee know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot argue at great length on the issue because we have already argued at considerable length on the general principles involved, and I should be repeating
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
myself. However, I shall say for the fifth time that it seems wrong to the Government and the National Insurance Advisory Committee—indeed, it seemed wrong to the last two Labour Governments—that benefit for people in receipt of substantial occupational pensions should not be abated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not argued that people on a pension, no matter how generous, who plan their early retirement, should be able to claim unemployment benefit. We are talking about people on small pensions who did not plan their retirement but found themselves unemployed and are actively seeking work. Will the Minister please respond to what we are talking about, and not pretend that we are discussing an entirely different group of people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I misunderstood the purport of the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Heeley. I thought that it sought to move the abatement provision up to the age of 64 so that there would be no abatement at all for people under 64. That is what I was talking about and if I am wrong, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment negates the Government's policy, which was derived from recommendations by the National Insurance Advisory Committee, which were accepted by the last two Labour Governments. We do not believe that it is right or proper to go back on that policy. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend to oppose the amendment if it is pressed to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) are saying. The occupational pension scheme payment is not necessarily large. We have a different language nowadays. What is now called early retirement used to be called redundancy, getting the push or not being needed. People are not saying, "I've done my calculations, I'll get my unemployment benefit and my occupational pension scheme and I can live quite comfortably till the official retirement age of 65." Many of them have been told by their employers, "Look, you have to go one way or the other so why not take early retirement?" Those people may find themselves with a considerable drop of income, with the same outgoings and without any time to adjust. All we are saying is that they have paid into the system, why can they not get their money back out when they are 64?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. Gentleman mentioned the last year in the way that he has—the year when one is just coming up to retirement. As I said, the Government's policy since 1981, in line with the NIAC, is to have an abatement—not for any occupational pension but for one that brings in an income of over £35 a week. That is a policy that we argued thoroughly this morning under when discussing amendments. The earlier amendments would have ameliorated that position—this one would actually destroy it. For that reason, and as this is our policy, I must ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if it is pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 4, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1 A) After subsection (1 A) of that section there shall be inserted the following subsection—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1B) For the purposes of entitlement to any benefit, a person who, but for the provisions of subsection (1) above, would be entitled to unemployment benefit in any week, shall be entitled to be credited with earnings for that week to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as if he were entitled to unemployment benefit in that week.'.".</p></blockquote>
I shall give a little preamble to this amendment, because that will give me a couple of days for more detailed preparation. It will also give the Minister a little more time to think of what I might say whan I come to the substantive point of what I shall be saying when I am fully prepared. I have a starting block on the amendment, which is a fairly technical one. The Minister may want to accept the amendment now—he is a decent sort of fellow, so perhaps he does. He has all the charm of a ticket collector, does he not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that the reduction of the age at which abatement of unemployment benefit commences, from 60 to 65, has produced an unfortunate anomaly that this amendment seeks to remove. Unemployed people over 60 have national insurance contributions credited to them automatically up to the end of the tax year in which they reach the age of 64. Those contribution credits can be of great importance in protecting their pension rights and those of their widows, and that is the subject of this amendment. Until this year, loss of unemployment benefit as a result of occupational pensions abatement did not affect entitlement to credits because the abatement affected only those over 60. However, from 1 January 1989, those aged 55 to 59 are also subject to the abatement but they do not have the same entitlement to automatic contribution credits as those over 60. As a result—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
