	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Myer. I did not receive notice of the meeting of this Committee, but fortunately no harm has been done. I presume that it has something to do with the printing dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>PROHIBITION OF NEW FEUDUTIES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 9, leave out from 'feuduty' to end of line 2 on page 2, and insert 'or any conditions'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 16, in Clause 4, page 3, line 21, leave out from 'force' to end of line 22 and insert 'without any conditions'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a layman in this Committee, I recognise that I am very much in the hands of the Philistines, with so many representatives of the legal profession here, particularly on the Opposition benches. However, being a simple person, I have tabled a simple amendment which is self-explanatory and obvious. It may not be a practical amendment from the legal viewpoint,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
but this defect, if it exists, can surely be overcome by my legal colleagues. I hope that any fault in the drafting of the amendment will not preclude its acceptance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as the time is long overdue for abolishing this outdated and outmoded payment of feuduty, so has the time come to abolish the feudalistic conditions so frequently imposed in the past. When ground is purchased, the superiority should rest solely with the purchaser and, subject only to the statutes as controlled by the planning and building authorities. For far too long we have allowed some of our feudal landlords to act virtually as planning authorities as well as ground superiors. We in Fife—and this is generally so throughout Scotland—have suffered over many years and in the not too distant past from the frustration created by such feudal landlords. The public authorities in Fife and even in the Borough of Buckhaven and Methil have been in many cases the subject of protracted negotiations because of the consequent attitude of this feudal baron.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely my right hon. and learned Friend can understand the need and desire of many people and of public authorities in Scotland for real freedom subject only to the public welfare as cared for by public authorities and not by the personal prejudice of the feudal barons, be they old or young.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases the title deeds of property in Scotland are couched in such obscure language that an owner has of necessity to incur considerable legal expenses if he desires to make alterations for his feu, because as a layman he is generally not able to decide what he can or cannot do. If he is a retired pensioner he may not be in a position to meet such legal fees. Even worse, he may not be able to appeal to the appropriate tribunal to be freed from some unreasonable condition of his feu once he has discovered this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had such a case only a few weeks ago in my constituency. Even the neighbours of this constituent, who was greatly perturbed and concerned, came to see me about this and expressed strongly their hope that the Bill will not only remove conditions from future feus but eliminate the existing conditions, where the right has been given to redeem the present feuduties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this is a matter which comes under Clause 4, but I observe that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
you, Sir Myer, have decided to link Amendment No. 16 with Amendment No. 1. Therefore, the arguments I adduce in favour of removing conditions from future feus apply to the feus which are likely to be redeemed in future. I appreciate that the drafting of my amendment may not conform strictly to legal requirements, but I hope that in replying to my special plea the Lord Advocate will undertake to accept the principle of my amendment and correct any drafting errors in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. Ronald King Murray)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the point my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) has made. I think I should be correct in saying that he is conveying to the Committee two elements of disquiet. The first is that we are not at this stage dealing with the phase 3 reform—a radical reform of the system of feudal land tenure—and, of course, the Government share his concern. We should have liked to be doing a phase 3 operation, as no doubt would the Opposition, although they had much more opportunity to do it than we have had in a few short months. Both sides of the Committee are dedicated to a phase 3 operation and I think many of us would wish we were doing that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the realities of political life are such that we are now concerned with a phase 2 operation, which I think is a pretty good one. The effect of amendment—and I do not dwell on any technical defects; the point is the important thing to discuss—would be to convert the Bill from a phase 2 Bill to a phase 3 Bill. That is a far more complicated and difficult operation, as I am sure my hon. Friend recognises, than would be involved simply in the amendment and the associated Amendment No. 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In inviting my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment, may I say that the Government will move apace, given the opportunity to do so, with the phase 3 Bill. We shall do our best to get on with the job of the review and reform of the system of land tenure in Scotland in the direction that he desires, namely, to get rid of the feudal element and to replace it by a modern and equitable system of land ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Implied in the amendments is the doctrine which I cannot accept that there
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
is no place at all for land conditions. On reconsideration, my hon. Friend may feel that he has gone too far. It is clear that there are many fields in which it is perfectly reasonable and proper that there should be conditions running with land. Indeed, to some extent it can be said that people south of the Border envy us the system of land conditions running with the land that we have in Scotland because it enables sensible, practical neighbourhood arrangements to be made which are to the benefit of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of a landlord or a superior imposing something upon inferiors. It is rather a mutual arrangement for the general interest. May I give some examples? In the management of common property, for instance, where there is amenity ground shared by several houses, it is highly satisfactory to make the necessary regulations by conditions which run with the land. At present we call these feudal but under a system of reformed land law we shall have to think of a better name for the conditions which go with the land and provide a right to each of the proprietors to exercise the necessary rights and to accept the necessary obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar obligations arise in regard to car parking areas, where there is a common car park, or in regard—this is an obvious example—to flats and tenements, where it is highly desirable that there should be some common burden for maintenance, and so on. Bearing in mind that, by and large, the objectives which my hon. Friend seeks are shared, not only by the Government, but probably by almost everybody in the Committee, perhaps my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Lord Advocate. I endorse all that he has said. If the amendment were carried, a contractual right that sometimes arises which is very useful for a proprietor, could be removed. It arises in the particular situation where there is a common feuing plan and a number of plots with an obligation to enforce similar conditions on each feu. For instance, if I were a proprietor and you, Sir Myer, were my neighbour and you were breaching the conditions, I could sue you. However careful a planning authority is, it cannot give that particular right. So whatever
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the phase 3 Bill is to be, I should like to think that that very useful right, which is not much used, but is available and is a sanction against people doing ridiculous things with their properties, will be retained. If the amendment were to be passed, that right would go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) for raising this amendment. It has given an opportunity to debate, albeit briefly, some of the much wider issues. I support what the Lord Advocate has said, in that simply to try to get rid of all the feudal conditions in one step like this would be throwing out the baby with the bath water. As he said, in certain conditions, if one gets rid of the word feudal and talks about land conditions, there are land conditions—I spoke about this on Second Reading—that can be useful and can provide a useful form of control to people's mutual advantage in particular areas. I support very much what the Lord Advocate has said. Knowing that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy is a reasonable man, I am quite sure he will have been persuaded by the arguments of his right hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one point. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that he hoped to move on apace with the phase 3 operation. As he knows, this was our intention when we were in power, although certain other matters, such as land registration, might have to come before a phase 3 Bill. In going towards the phase 3 operation, I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will continue what we intended, which was the widest possible consultation with all the bodies involved in Scotland. This is an extremely complex operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having had a little to do with consultations that followed the Green Paper on land tenure reform, I know the tremendous breadth of observation made to us, the tremendous number of bodies with interests in this and with very constructive points of view to put forward. It will be very helpful to those bodies which are in consultation with the Government if the right hon. and learned Gentleman will give an assurance that these consultations will continue as widely as possible so that people who have interests in land conditions generally and in the kind of phase 3 operation we are discussing will have the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
fullest opportunity to put their points of view to the Scottish Office and to consult with Ministers should that be necessary. If he could give that assurance, I would support what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said in asking the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily give that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My impression when I tabled this simple amendment that it would be described in the Committee as raising a whole host of complications has proved to be correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) said that there could be land conditions which cannot be covered by restrictions of planning and holding authorities. Nevertheless, I am impressed by my right hon. and learned Friend's argument that he proposes to proceed apace with a phase 3 Bill which will eliminate to a large extent the feudal conditions about which I and my constituents are very much concerned. As he has expressed considerable sympathy with the point I made earlier this morning, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 9, leave out from ' feu-duty ' to end of line 2 in page 2 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'provided that nothing in this section shall affect the binding nature of any conditions included in any deed executed after that date which contains a grant of land in feu'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment follows upon the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in the course of the debate on the principle of the Bill. During that debate the Lord Advocate made it clear that he did not view Clause 1(1) as creating a legal fiction. With respect, I suggest to him that this is not the case and that on re-reading this subsection the words "as if" clearly create a legal fiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to seek to find some other way of affecting the purpose of the Bill, which is the reduction and abolition of the one penny feu which was in the previous Bill, while,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
at the same time, not creating a legal fiction. The right hon. and learned Gentleman would accept that legal fictions are not enjoyed by the law of Scotland; in fact, they have sometimes been described as obnoxious to the law of Scotland. It is really on his behalf that I should hate to see him go down in history as the first Lord Advocate to introduce English legal principles into the law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the amendment may not be completely watertight, but I hope he will accept that it is a way of effecting his purpose without creating a legal fiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) for raising this point, particularly in view of the explanation that he has given, that this arose out of my resistance to the proposition he invited me to accept on Second Reading, that I was the father of a legal fiction in this part of the Bill. At that time I rejected the accusation he made on the basis that what the clause he seeks to amend does is simply to cut out of the feudal package the thing we want to excise, namely, the feuduty. I still maintain that is what it does. If one is excising the feu duty without doing any possible damage to the feudal package, then that is the objective I seek to achieve and the wording of the Bill as it stands achieves exactly that objective. It does it very concisely, with a smaller number of words than the hon. Gentleman uses in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that lays me open to the accusation of fathering, however indirectly, a legal fiction, then I am prepared to take it. If it is a legal fiction, I have to stand by it. However, after fair consideration, I think it would be wrong to say that every time one uses the words "as if" a fiction is introduced. One could say for example, that "her face lit up as if from within". That is a description of how somebody appears; there is no fiction in it at all. The words "as if" are often used in a purely descriptive sense. If one were to use any other words here one would be in danger of damaging the feudal package and it is that feudal package that we want to maintain entire, with the excision of the feuduty itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a difficult operation because, after all, hon. Members who were present
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
during the Committee stage of the previous Bill will recollect that the Conservative Government were quite willing to consider other ways in which the feudal package could be preserved. However, they took the view—and there was some legal justification for it—that if one took away the reddendo the requirement to give something in respect of a tenure—then the feudal package would fall apart, land conditions and everything. This was a perfectly respectable legal view to hold and the Lord Advocate of the day, now Lord Wylie, took that view and expounded it very convincingly to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Labour Government came into office, I took a different view. I took the view that we could do it a different way, and this is the other way we have found which would be effective and safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two conflicting requirements. One is the requirement of keeping the feudal package together. There are those who say there must be a reddendo for that, although, frankly, I do not agree, but one cannot put their view at nought. That is a valid legal view which may have some effect at the end of the day if the matter ever came to the courts in litigation. On the other hand, there is a desire on which we are united. There are differing views on reddendo, but we are united in the desire to excise feuduty from the feudal package now and not leave it until phase 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two things can be reconciled and are reconciled effectively and with economy of words—albeit at the risk of my achieving the fame that the hon. Gentleman wants to attach to me or the disfavour that he wants to attach to me—in the Bill as drafted. It is proper that I should point out that this requirement for a reddendo stems not from statute but from common law. Whereas it is easy enough to say that by statute we will abolish feuduty, it is not altogether a simple matter and not a matter which can be satisfactorily dealt with by the amendment. It is not satisfactory to patch up the common law in the same way. As it now stands, the clause seeks to say that feuduty goes, but the package is preserved in such a way that any common law requirement that may continue for a reddendo is covered and if to say that it is a legal fiction to say that the package continues as if there was a reddendo, I have to accept it as a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
fiction but to say that it is the best, most economical and least damaging way to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the amendment is adequate for our purpose. It refers only to the binding nature of any conditions included in the feudal grants, but by implication it would not preserve the feudal relationship for any other purpose; for example, it might well cast doubt on the rights of over-superiors or on the rights of heritable creditors over superiority. These would not fall within the four corners of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, a very small point of criticism but it is a technical criticism. The hon. Member has not put down amendments for the same purpose to Clauses 4 and 5 and that would have to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment and perhaps temper the criticism that he sought to cast upon me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I agree it creates a fiction and fictions have been repugnant to the law of Scotland for very good reasons. The law of Scotland is basically a law of common sense and a fiction is not particularly good common sense. I am not saying this because I have any objection to borrowing good ideas from English law; I take the view that one should borrow the best ideas one can. But I am against borrowing ideas that may worsen the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment in addition because it makes the matter clearer. I admire the paucity of words that the Lord Advocate has managed to achieve and I take the Lord Advocate's point that he achieves his purpose with this short form. As a lawyer reading the clause for the first time, I had doubts about the binding nature of the conditions. I had to read it a number of times to reassure myself, and therefore, in the interests of clarity, it is better to reaffirm that the conditions are of a binding nature until such time as we look again at the whole nature of the feudal system and call it something much better. A smaller number of words does not always produce greater clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to reddendo, with all respect this is rather an obtuse argument. By the way the Lord Advocate has worded the clause, he has done away with reddendo. It is quite clear that, for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
purposes of the Bill, the Bill will rule the law and we do not need to worry about reddendo. For these reasons, I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to become involved in legal arguments amongst so many people who are learned in the law, which I am not. We put down this amendment simply to register once again our concern—and I am glad that we have the support of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing)—that in legal terms a fiction has been perpetrated, for which I rely on the advice of my hon. and learned Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations have come to me from the Scottish branch of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and I find it interesting that it, too, has expressed concern on this point. A paper submitted to eight members of the Committee says that a feuduty should be retained of one penny per annum if asked to ensure the binding nature of the agreement involved. It is interesting that a professional organisation such as that of surveyors who have to deal in property believe that it would have been better to have kept the Bill as it was when the Conservative Government introduced it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we shall persuade the right hon. and learned Gentleman on this point. He regards it as rather an important point in the Bill, as I gathered from the Second Reading debate. But I beg him, even at this late stage, to consider this in view of the weight of opinion not only from those in the legal profession but also from those such as chartered surveyors who have an interest in this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that some interesting arguments and very clear points have been put by hon. Members and I have taken note of what they have said. This is a key matter for the phase 2 Bill. Perhaps I should elaborate slightly on the arguments which I deployed earlier. I do not for a moment doubt that it is better to word a legal operation of this sort in such a way that it does not involve legal fictions. I therefore accept what the hon.

	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be. We have to face the realities of political as well as feudal time-tables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could present the arguments in a little more detail before we move to a decision. The amendment is radically defective in the sense which I have already indicated. It provides that nothing in Clause 1 is to affect the binding nature of conditions in future feus. That is quite clear from the wording of the provision. But the need to have a feu duty in order to establish a feudal relationship stems not from statute but from common law. It is at least doubtful whether the wording of the amendment would he sufficient to override that common law requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have pointed out that this is not necessarily a view which all lawyers would share, nor one to which I adhere, but it is a view which was sufficiently cogent to convince the last Government on the best legal advice which they could obtain. One must take that into account. The hon. Gentleman should take it into account even more than I because it was his Government's view that this was a matter of doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share that doubt to the extent that it is important that any wording of the clause should deal with that specific difficulty which weighed so large in the previous Government's considerations. My drafting of the Bill—if I may accept the paternity of it, which is a little unfair because it has been drafted by expert draftsmen whose ability I cannot claim to equal—deals satisfactorily with the matter, and I do not think the hon. Member for Berwick
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
and East Lothian would suggest otherwise, apart from the general criticism of fiction which he put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put to him the choice which I have myself taken. At the risk of being pilloried as the father of a legal fiction, I should rather accept that than take the risk of damaging the land package with which we are concerned in the Bill in the phase 2 operation. It is in that light that I present the case to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The preferable approach in this situation, with the requirement to meet the contingency of the common law view of the feudal package, is to provide for future feus to have effect as if a feu duty were payable—in other words, as if the common law requirement were met. In addition, the amendment is not truly a proviso of a consideration we may see. This is a cogent argument. It is not a proviso. It does not derogate from the absolute prohibition of future feu duties which is provided for at the beginning of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to aspects of the feudal relationship, other than the enforcement of land conditions, which the hon. Gentleman highlighted, as I have already pointed out, the amendment is inadequate. It does not cover the other aspects which are at present covered by the clause. The existing wording will ensure that for all other purposes the feu grant will operate as if there were a feu duty. That is the effect of the word "otherwise". For all other purposes it is a general provision covering all the contingencies and not just dealing with one which is, of course, the important one, as the hon. Gentleman has highlighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers only to the binding nature of any conditions included in the feudal grant. By implication it would not preserve the feudal relationship for any other purposes. For example, it would seem to throw doubt on the very important sphere of heritable securities, not to mention over-superiorities which are, perhaps, a more esoteric field of the law. Heritable securities are very important, and I do not think one would want to run any risks with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not make it clear that a grant in feu will continue to create a new estate in the land and will not merely be a disposition with conditions enforceable by the disponer. It is preferable to say, as does the clause, that the grant has effect as a feu but without a feu duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
These reasons are strictly lawyers' reasons, but they are sound and good reasons and I do not apologise to the Committee for elaborating them a little more than I might have done. May I say to the hon. Lady that I understand the criticism that has been made; I face up to it. But this is a phase 2 operation. It is not a Bill, if enacted, that will last for ever. It is an interim, holding operation to excise the feuduties, which everybody wants to do, and to do the least damage to what is good in the existing system of land tenure until the phase 3 operation comes round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time element is very important and I hope that the legal arguments that I have presented are sufficiently cogent to convince the hon. Lady that this is not an amendment which should be supported. In any event, perhaps she could be persuaded that, in view of the fact that this is no more than a holding statute, the arguments which she advanced are not as cogent in this case as they might be in a phase 3 Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I regret that he is not prepared to accept the principle of the argument which has been advanced from this side of the Committee or to consider the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, because I realised that the amendment is not as comprehensive as it should be, especially in the rather esoteric respects that he highlighted, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, which I do with sorrow, and if the right hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to go down in history as living in a world of fantasy and fiction, then so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These essentially drafting amendments will not lead me to wish to go either to the stake or to the barricades in their support. The purpose of the amendments is very simple and straightforward. Line 25 of Clause 3 refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the effect of increasing the total amount of fueduty exigible in respect of any land;"</p></blockquote>
The term "exigible", as I understand it, is in the present tense, yet it refers to a deed or deeds which will cease to have any effect. My amendment is slightly more grammatically appropriate. I hope that the Lord Advocate will be able to consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point of these amendments. I think the Committee is grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the point about the meaning of this clause. It appears to me that the words merely make more explicit, by the hon. Gentleman's way of looking at it, what is already quite clearly intended by the wording of the Bill. That is indeed the way he presented these amendments. The effect of the amendments would be to replace the existing reference, by reference to the "total amount of feuduty" beyond that which would have been exigible,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of any land prior to the execution of any such deed".</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with charters of novodamus. On Second Reading the hon. Member for Dumbartonshire East (Mr. Henderson) put a strong point about this rather archaic type of deed. I think he may have been talking with some of his learned friends since then, and has perhaps a better idea of what a charter of novodamus is meant to mean—a Latin phrase which is common currency in Garscadden, where my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Small) got many of his Latin phrases, and he would have no difficulty in dealing with the phrase "charter of novodamus". It is simply a new grant of land used to correct an error in an existing charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where this sort of correction has to be made, I think it is important that the power to have a new charter should be very strictly limited. The object of Clause 3 is to prevent, in any such regranting of a charter of a land tenure, the feuduty being increased. That is the object of the exercise. If this can be done in a simple and concise way without unnecessary or otiose words, then it is better. These words do not add to the clarity of the clause although the intention of doing so is clear and I understand it. In fact, I think they raise a certain amount of doubts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing wording of Clause 3, page 2, lines 24 to 26—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which does not have the effect of increasing the total amount of feuduty exigible in respect of any land;"</p></blockquote>
achieves the object which the hon. Gentleman sets out to achieve with clarity and precision. The words which the amendment seeks to add do not contribute anything in clarity and are redundant. The fact that they are redundant is not necessarily an argument against including them in the Bill. It could be said that perhaps it makes it easier to understand. Even if it makes it easier to understand— I do not take that view—if the words themselves themselves are unnecessary there is a risk that it will alter the meaning in such a way as to introduce ambiguity and doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two respects in which such ambiguity and doubt could be introduced by these amendments. One is the conditional tense, or the subjunctive mood or whatever is the right grammatical English phrase for it. "Would have been" exigible is what is included in the amendment, but, strictly speaking, I should have thought that what the hon. Gentleman had in mind was that feuduties "were" exigible. That he has couched it in these terms—"would have been" exigible— may raise a doubt about what period of time he is referring to. I should have thought that without the words of the amendment there is no doubt that one is referring to feuduties that were exigible in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
In addition, whereas the words "any such deed or deeds" are used properly and accurately earlier in Clause 3, if they are introduced again in the place where the amendment seeks to put them, there is a degree of doubt about what deeds are being covered. I do not think that doubt exists in the earlier reference, but I think it does in the later reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. I think we would share the desire to have clarity here and that on reflection he will feel that it does not add to the clarity of the words as they stand but, indeed, introduces the doubts which I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Lord Advocate, for the simple reason that I should understand it better his way than if the amendment were added.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Member referred to ambiguities in clauses. The purpose of this amendment is, I still believe, to remove a potential ambiguity. The right hon. and learned Member will accept that the only persons likely to benefit from ambiguities in clauses are members of the profession to which both he and I belong. Nevertheless, if the Lord Advocate is satisfied that the present wording of the clause will deprive both himself and myself of any future employment in this respect, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 34, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and the total amount exigible in respect of each of two or more feu-duties contained in such a deed or in two or more deeds executed on the same day, shall be such part of the total amount of feu-duty which would have been exigible in respect of the totality of the land affected by such deed or deeds as is equal to that part of the totality of the land which said feu-duty is exigible in respect of'.</p></blockquote>
May I, in moving the amendment, apologise immediately to the Committee for its total inelegance. Nevertheless, I believe that it will help to meet the possible problem arising through the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
present wording of the clause. The second part of Clause 3 refers to the situation where a new charter or new deed has replaced one amount of feuduty which was exigible by two or more feuduties. The clause rightly says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the total amount of feuduty exigible in respect of any land … to the extent that—"</p></blockquote>
it is greater than that which would have been previously exigible shall he disregarded and the deed shall "be void and unenforceable". I have no objection whatsoever to the purpose behind that. The point of the amendment, however, is to deal with such a situation when, or if, it arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, the present clause, while it declares that the new sum total feuduty shall be void and unenforceable to the extent to which it exceeds the present feuduty, does not declare how the reduction is to be made. It may be that the ordinary principles of the law in regard to allocation deal with this point. If not, I suggest that some amendment to the clause is required to ensure that a reduction in the amount of feuduty applicable in each of the new feuduties where a reduction had to be made should bear some proportion to the area of land to which the feuduty bears relation. It is with that in mind that the amendment has been tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this point. It touches upon the general point made by the hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) in the last debate, namely, the desirability of limiting very stringently what can be done in charters of novodamus. The Bill sets out in a modest way to do this in regard to the feuduty. But this being a phase 2 operation we cannot go beyond it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has raised another aspect, namely, the desirability of having an equitable arrangement in regard to allocation of feus in charters of novodamus. The purpose of the amendment I can well understand. It is a reasonable objective. It is to ensure that provisions relating to two or more feuduties are contained in a single charter of novodamus, or in two or more charters executed in the same day, the effect of which is that no
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
one feuduty gets priority over the others. The amount of feuduty which may be imposed on any land is to be limited to an amount bearing the same proportion to the total feuduty exigible under the original deed as the area of that land bears to the area of the total land granted by the original deed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the hon. Gentleman as he was moving the amendment—indeed, I think he honestly said it—felt that this might not be the answer but that the objective in achieving fairness should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I answer the hon. Gentleman by saying, first, that I understand the objective, but I think that this kind of problem would be more appropriately left to the phase 3 operation. In so far as he sought to deal with it with regard to feuduty, it is appropriate to consider it in a phase 2 context. However, to seek to do the sort of thing he is seeking to do in the amendment at this stage cuts across, for example, the very important jurisdiction with regard to unallocated feus which exists in the Lands Tribunal at the moment, and the important provisions under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act, 1970, which are associated with the Lands Tribunal jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have the undesirable effect of restricting the freedom of parties to charters of novodamus, in the circumstances with which we are dealing, to vary the liability of feuduty within the overall limitation of liability under the deed which the charter of novodamus replaces. I shall give an illustration of the effect of introducing a rigidity without a more equitable background which can allow one to consider whether it is fair to do it in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only restriction which is desirable or is required in Clause 3 is the restriction that there should be no increase in the amount of the feuduty to be extracted from the land. That is the way we are approaching it and it is the purpose of the Bill, of course, to excise the feuduty. Therefore, the object with regard to charters of novodamus would be to ensure that there should be no increase in any feuduties which may be extracted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A restriction of the type envisaged by the amendment would prevent the parties to a transaction from taking account of other factors which it is obviously appropriate to take into account. For instance, if a superior in receipt of an unallocated
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
feuduty of £40 per annum from four uneconomic grazings of an acre each agrees to vary the feuing conditions to enable one grazing to be used for commercial development, then all four proprietors and the superior would probably, from a common sense point of view and from the point of view of what is fair and equitable in these circumstances, be perfectly prepared to accept that £37 of the £40 should be allocated to the commercial development and that the uneconomic grazings should each bear £1 or that the unallocated portion of £3 should remain on the three uneconomic grazings. I think hon. Members, when they consider it, will feel that that arrangement would be perfectly proper and appropriate in these circumstances. However, that would not be possible if the hon. Gentleman's amendment were given effect to, because there an artificial equality would be imposed upon the situation and the results would be very unfair. It would mean that the uneconomic grazings had to bear an equal share of the commercial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further serious objection to the amendment, and I heralded this by my reference to the phase 1 Act of 1970 and to the jurisdiction of the Lands Tribunal for Scotland. Both a notice of allocation of feuduty under Section 3 of the 1970 Act and an order for allocation made by the Lands Tribunal under Section 4 of the Act are deeds within the meaning of this Bill. Therefore, the proposed amendment might have the effect of inhibiting proprietors from seeking an allocation of feuduty. I do not need to elaborate the complications that could result in the operation of that very reasonable jurisdiction which the Lands Tribunal enjoys if the hon. Gentleman's amendment were to be carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of these arguments, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for the comments which the Lord Advocate has made, and I am glad to hear that he accepts the general purpose behind the amendment as being desirable when phase 3 does eventually arrive.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a situation where the total amount of feuduty that will be demanded under a
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
charter of novodamus exceeds the amount previously exigible, can the Lord Advocate explain why, in terms of the present wording of the clause, the reduction that will have to be made will be made?

There may be a simple explanation in terms of allocation, and I should be grateful if he could give it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, in the situation envisaged by the hon. Gentleman, the feuduty will remain precisely as before, unallocated over the whole area of land involved.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Lord Advocate, but he has not answered my point. It may be my fault because of the way I expressed it. I envisage a situation in which an original area of land of, say, 100 acres had a feuduty of, say, £10 imposed on it. As a result of a charter of novodamus, the area is divided into two lots of, say, 75 acres and 25 acres. The sum total of the feuduty that it is desired to extract is, say, £15. Clearly, in terms of the clause, and quite rightly, that sum would have to be reduced to a total of £10, because no overall increase is allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to find out from the Lord Advocate if, given that a reduction of £5 is required, the £5 will come from new vassal A or new vassal B, or will they both have to bear some element of the reduction and, if so, in what proportion and how will it be determined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of this amendment is to simplify the Bill and to try to help those who will operate the Bill, the superiors and the vassals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in the Bill as it stands is that a proprietor who wishes to redeem a feuduty in terms of Clause 4 will give the superior or his agent a notice of redemption in, or as nearly as it may be in, the form contained in Form 1 of Schedule 1 to the Bill. That form is complicated. It is in legalistic language, and although solicitors and those trained in the law would understand it and find it quite simple it is not a form which an ordinary person would find easy to remember. Unless people had a copy of the Act they might find it difficult to send the right form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to create a position in which a proprietor who wishes to redeem a feuduty can give notification as informally as possible. It seems unnecessary to require a proprietor when he merely wishes to give notice of his desire to redeem a feuduty, to go to a solicitor and incur the expenses involved in order to have the proper notice drafted.

This notification is important, but I hope that others on this side of the Committee will agree with me that the same purpose could be served by an informal notice, so long as in that notice the land on which the wish to redeem the feuduty exists is described. This can be done in a simple and informal way, and the need for this notice, as it is in the Bill at present, would serve only to create complications and extra expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be cases where the proprietor is not a man of means and may not be a man who has a solicitor dealing with his
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
affairs but is one who would have to find a solicitor in order to have this notice served, because it is unlikely that people of this sort would have copies of this legislation in their houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that as a result of the arguments I have put forward on this amendment, which is trying to simplify and clarify, the Lord Advocate will feel able to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish strongly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) in this amendment. I think it would benefit the present framing of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate may remark that as presently phrased the Bill says that the notice must be in or as nearly as may be in the form in the schedule. The Bill as it stands does not require an exact repetition of the words in Schedule 1 and this clearly is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Lord Advocate to comment on why it is necessary in the first place to have anything in the nature of Schedule 1. We do not suggest that, for instance, Form 2, the receipt that is given, should be in anything other than legal language. Clearly where the feuduty has been redeemed and a receipt is to be granted by the superior, it is eminently desirable that this should be in definite and strict language as it might be the subject of future dispute. Here we are talking about the notice of intention that a vassal wishes to have a feuduty redeemed. As the Lord Advocate will willingly agree, for the most part superiors are more likely to be informed about the legal requirements of the situation than the average vassal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real danger that a superior who is not enthusiastic about wishing to have the feuduty redeemed could use the phrasing that is presently in the Bill as an excuse for not agreeing to the redemption of feuduty. He could simply say that the vassal let him know that he wanted to redeem the feuduty but did not do it properly. Therefore, he could delay it for a further six months. A vassal who thought that he was entitled to have his feuduty redeemed but who is given some legalistic reply by a superior might, rather than incur the expense of seeing a solicitor, simply say that obviously what he thought he was entitled to do he is not entitled to do, and therefore give up the whole idea or incur expense by taking legal advice on his rights.

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
If the Lord Advocate is not enthusiastic about the amendment, I should be interested to hear why he feels it is absolutely necessary to have a legalistic framework for merely giving a superior notice that a vassal wishes to exercise his rights under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) has moved the amendment most persuasively. He has been persuasively supported by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). I am deeply sympathetic with the object of the amendment. All of us should wish to see the arrangements in the Bill of such a nature that an ordinary lay person could send the requisite notice without undue formality. That is the objective of the Bill and of those who drafted it. I hope that it may be seen that the Bill as drafted achieves this objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentlemen recognised that there were qualifying words in the Bill as it stands which move away from rigid and legalistic requirements. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands pointed out that whereas the receipt may be required to be in a formal, legal guise, perhaps there is not the same requirement for the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy with the object of the amendment and if it were shown to me that there was a defect that could be cured and that there is something legalistic which is an obstacle to an ordinary lay person writing a requisite notice of an informal type, then I would be prepared to consider what amendment could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that, in the event of the arguments which I am deploying being successful and the amendment being withdrawn, I will look at this again to see whether any defect requires to be cured in order to meet the objective of the amendment. I do not think there is such a defect. I hope that the Committee will feel when I have deployed the arguments that there is no defect of this kind. In other words, although the criticism is valid, in the sense that the objective must be to have a door open for informal notices to be sent, the Bill adequately meets the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I point to one of the difficulties. I do not want to be nit-picking in any sense, but, looking at the words of the amendment, almost at once one finds
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
oneself up against the kind of difficulty which arises in this field. The amendment refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"notice of his desire to redeem the feuduty exigible in respect of such"—</p></blockquote>
up to there it is perfectly straightforward—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of such land as he describes in said notice".</p></blockquote>
By the word "describes," the conveyancers know at once that normally that would mean a conveyancing description. The amendment is defective in that it would invite the informal letter to be informal right up to the point where the land is described and one would tend to find, if the amendment were made as it stands, that the law would say "description" there requires an adequate conveyancing description of the land. That would not be the objective that hon. Gentlemen are seeking to achieve at all, nor that we are seeking to achieve in the Bill. That is a defect in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give a little more detail. The Bill refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"notice of redemption in or as nearly as may be in the form contained in Form 1 of Schedule 1 to this Act,"</p></blockquote>
Admittedly, wording like that is a bit formidable, because ordinary people are not all that attracted by forms and they are usually rather repelled by the word "schedule."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that is in the Bill, it will be the Government's objective to ensure that there is maximum publicity to the public generally about the rights of redemption which would be given to proprietors of land if this Bill were enacted. Therefore) one hopes that the forms in question wil, be readily available and that people will not have to face the difficulty of being repelled by the technicalities of having to look up a statute, but they will readily be able to obtain in the usual places, like post offices and citizens advice bureaux, the necessary printed form which they would have to fill up with the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take it in good faith that the Government's intention is to ensure, as was the previous Government's, the maximum publicity and maximum availability of guidance and of forms. Therefore, perhaps the difficulties he highlighted are not as great as he indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
I come to the other main argument. Without going too deeply into the matter, I think there are other arguments I could adduce, but I feel that perhaps the most important point is to refer to the schedule itself and point out that all that is required in the schedule is the simple and basic information which is necessary in order to carry through the transaction properly and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All one has to provide if one is a proprietor is one's own name and address and the date of the signing of the notice. Normally one would do that, of course. There would be the date at the top of the letter and one would sign at the bottom. There would be an address. Secondly, there would be the name and address of the superior or his agent. That would normally be the person to whom the proprietor pays the feuduty. One would probably be addressing that person in the text of the letter itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, one would want to mention the term day on which the proprietor wishes to redeem the feuduty. Again, all the publicity would be in terms of the fact that the option is to be exercised in regard to a term day ensuing after the date when the proprietor indicates his desire to redeem the feuduty. Fourthly, there would be the amount of the feuduty. If one were referring to a feuduty that one pays on the land, it would be quite natural to include the amount of the feuduty. Lastly, the schedule requires sufficient identification of the land in respect of which the feuduty is exacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one thinks about it that is what is spelt out in the schedule—no more, no less. Is that not exactly what the hon. Gentleman seeks to have spelt out in any event in his amendment? It seems that the saving words—the words which both hon. Gentlemen referred to—"in the form or as nearly as may be in the form" simply provides that if an informal letter is written by, for example, an old lady who wishes to redeem her feuduty and does not want to get involved in the clutches of the legal profession, will secure that if she just writes down the commonsense facts, which are outlined for her in the schedule, the formal letter will be as good as a formal notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that, I hope that hon. Members opposite will feel that the schedule is a useful guide and that it enables somebody to write an informal
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
letter if he wishes to do so. Secondly, it is the intention of the Government to ensure that the public are well aware of the rights which are to be given to them under this legislation. I hope that hon. Members will accept that in these circumstances the very laudable objective which they seek is adequately met by the wording of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should repeat that if a specific defect, as distinct from the general objective which we all share in the Committee, can be pointed out to me I undertake to look into that aspect of it and see whether an appropriate amendment could be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Lord Advocate has opened the door to informality with the use of the word "nearly", but I should like to ask him a question. Can I postulate a notice by an old lady off her own bat who does not actually refer to the Act—in other words, sends in something without Section 4 of the Land Tenure Reform (Scotland) Act 1974. Let us assume she makes no mention of the Act itself but just says that she wishes to redeem the feuduty of her house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question would be, if she missed out a reference to the term Whitsunday or Martinmas, surely she could be protected by the practice of just making it with the ensuing term. It is really open to a lady to write it informally? Has the Lord Advocate, by the use of the words in Clause 3, not made it likely that there would have to be a reference to the Act? If that is the case, then I must fall down on the intention of the amendment, although I take the point about the word "describes" which I had not considered until the Lord Advocate pointed to the difficulty of that word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the intention of the amendment quite seriously because, as a solicitor in practice, I know that many people, particularly old people, regard a trip to the solicitor as an extraordinary event, a bit like going to the dentist, perhaps worse. One would like to save old people particularly, or people who are not accustomed to dealing with property, any unnecessary expensive trouble. I wonder whether the Lord Advocate really has opened the door to informality by the rather strict wording of the schedule. Surely he would have to interpret his word "nearly" as allowing only a minimal variation and probably leave the framework
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
of formality which I should like to see removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have some sympathy with the intention of the amendment. I certainly know with pleasure that even members of the legal profession can draft an amendment with defects. However, my right hon. and learned Friend spoke about the degree of informality and how it is set out in Schedule 10. He referred to the fact that the maximum publicity would be given. It is all right for my right hon. and learned Friend to make such a promise in the Committee, but these promises are not always kept to the strict letter of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask him whether, in giving this publicity, he would consider making these forms freely available in post offices throughout the country. This is only one of the ways which would help people who are not inclined to visit solicitors and who want to redeem their feu with the least possible inconvenience to themselves and the least possible expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also inclined to support the view that an even greater degree of informality would have been better, if it were possible along the lines suggested by the hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing). But in view of the fact that it is unlikely that this can be done in the short time available, if my right hon. and learned Friend accepts the suggestion of making the forms available in the post offices we on this side of the Committee will be able to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as a layman like myself finds it hard to see a difference between "describe" and "identify", so it is that Whitsunday and Martinmas may have some particular legal significance such as "describe" had which I failed immediately to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the Forms in Schdule 1, I wonder, if it is necessary to keep in the terms Whitsunday and Martinmas, whether it might be thought appropriate to have a footnote on the Form to indicate what date of the year these festivals fall upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Lord Advocate for the assurances he has given that he will reconsider this matter. Before I am prepared to consider with- drawing the amendment, there are certain
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
questions I should like to ask him. First, he pointed out that in the Form there are certain words in italics and that is really all that has to be filled in. But in order for the right hon. and learned Gentleman to be right in this respect, he would have to ensure that every proprietor had a Form. I think that publicity in the papers, magazines, leaflets or circulars would not be sufficient. This is a difficulty in his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also take the Lord Advocate's point about the word "definition" in my amendment. But I would equally say that sufficient identification has certain legal ramifications which could cause equal complications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real defect—which I did not mention when moved the amendment because I had not actually considered it myself at that time, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman himself pointed to his own defect—is what do the words "as nearly as may be" mean? If one is talking about the possibility of legal disputes in the future, it may well be that somebody who wrote an informal letter might find himself facing litigation, or some form of legal action, because the superior could argue that this was not "as nearly as may be" in the form set out in the schedule. Clearly the words "as nearly as may be" are open to all sorts of different interpretations. I am sure the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows from his own experience, as I know from my short legal experience, that it is words of that sort to do with Forms of that sort—this has arisen often in terms of notices to quit—where a slight variation in the word has given rise to litigation. This is a difficulty and a defect within the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, before I consider withdrawing the amendment, I should like to know why we have this clause at all, if the right hon. and learned Gentleman is correct that a simple letter from an old lady will suffice, forgetting the Form at the back, forgetting that she might not know when Whitsunday or Martinmas is, but taking it that she can just write a simple letter saying that she wishes to redeem her feuduty. It becomes totally superfluous. If that is the case, then the situation which this amendment seeks to provide exists already and the whole clause and Form 1 in Schedule 1 are totally unnecessary. Until I have an assurance from the Lord Advocate as to why this clause is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
in the Bill and that he is right in what he said, I am not prepared to consider withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) had his tongue in his cheek in the last comment he made, because he must realise that, on the hypothesis he puts, namely, if the old lady could write a letter without regard to the schedule or to the requirements of the Bill, ignoring them entirely, clearly it could be argued that the schedule was unnecessary. But the point is that she would have to include in her informal letter what is desiderated in the schedule to the Bill. It is clear that, if she did not do that, the informal letter would not be effective. I do not think the hon. Gentleman meant simply to put a debating point. The substance of what he said was that, as he said originally, the schedule is too technical to meet this situation. It does not give adequate guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I indicated very briefly when I replied to the hon. Gentleman at the opening of the debate that the Government's intention was to have a printed form of notice and I referred inadvertently to the probability that it would be available in post offices. I think that I should have said in public libraries and citizens advice bureaux. I cannot undertake that the forms will be available from post offices, although I should like to see that done and it may be possible. In any rate, there should be maximum availability of an appropriate printed form. My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) has pressed this point upon me, and I entirely accept the way that the point was put. It would be desirable, and I accept on behalf of the Government that simple printed forms should be readily available, requiring people to put in in the appropriate place all the essential information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that perhaps meets the real point of the hon. Gentleman's criticism. If these printed forms are to be available, readily understood and accompanied by a simple guide explaining how to fill them in, it may be that all the difficulties that we have dealt with may be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be sufficient for the hon. Gentleman in this context to be prepared
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
to consider withdrawing the amendment. I should go a stage further. Not only the hon. Gentleman who moved the amendment and his hon. Friend who supported it, but also my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy, the hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) and the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson), have put points to me which are worthy of further consideration. I should not attempt to answer today the hon. Lady's point, for example, but I should like to consider that very carefully to see whether reference to the section or the Act is essential. These are matters of great significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East rightly put the point that we talk glibly in legal context of Whitsunday and Martinmas often, as the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian pointed out, without remembering what precise dates they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not take up further time of the Committee, but I most earnestly undertake to consider these points seriously and assess the extent to which the defects that have been pointed out are serious, and I undertake that, if so advised, an appropriate amendment will be tabled by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Craigen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to simplify matters all round, because I doubt if many old ladies will understand the formula in the Bill and they will be driven into the clutches of the lawyers to work it out unless they happen to have their own accountant. I have no doubt that both lawyers and accountants would charge them a hand- some fee and at the end of the day they might decide not to proceed to redeem the feuduty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose is, therefore, to simplify matters and the period of five years was chosen because it is quite a fair length of time and, in these inflationery times, a number of superiors would be glad to relieve themselves of the diminishing value of the annual feuduty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not put down an amendment on this, but I should make the point to the Lord Advocate that perhaps "extinguish" would be better than "redeem" and perhaps "extinction" would be better than "redemption" throughout the Bill. It would clarify that it is the feuduty which concerns us and not the various responsibilities that go with the possession of the feu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, since I submitted this amendment only yesterday, I am quite prepared to concede that the Lord Advocate may not have had sufficient time to study the matter in detail. Therefore, I should be happy to leave it with him until Report, because on reflection he will agree with me that the amendment clarifies matters and makes it simpler for those people, purchasers and owner-occupiers, whom he is trying to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of Amendment No. 9 in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) and for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) and myself was put perhaps better than I can put it by my hon. Friend the learned Member for Cathcart in the debate on principle. I know that the right hon. and learned Gentleman heard the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment starts from the principle which this side of the committee accepts that a just return must be given to the superior and that this can be calculated only on the basis of some form of Government stock. This principle is accepted in the Bill and not disputed on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
The point of the amendment is that to take 2½per cent. Consolidated Stock is not logical in terms of feuduty. Feuduty is paid gross and is taxable at the end of the year. As the Lord Advocate knows, Consolidated Stock has tax deducted at source. The purpose of this amendment is to try to find a proper comparison and some form of Government stock which, as in the case of feuduty, is paid gross. As a fluke, a coincidence or fate, the 3½per cent. War Loan is one of the few Government stocks—I think that I am right in saying it is the only one—where tax is not deducted at source. Because the 3½per cent. War Loan creates an exactly similar situation in tax terms to the payment of feuduty, this amendment tries to get some logical comparison and consistency between the feuduty element so far as tax is concerned in the hands of the superior and what would come out of this clause of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If we eliminate the words in the clause and insert "five times the annual feuduty", as my hon. Friend has suggested, we would overcome all the difficulties which the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the amendment, but I cannot understand how to do this calculation. I took the Bill into the Common Room in the Glasgow Sheriff Court and asked 30 lawyers if any of them could do the calculation and none of them could do it. However, they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
may not have been the most intelligent cross-section. I simply make the point that it was very complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say very seriously to the Lord Advocate that the obligation is placed on the vassal. Some of these superiors may not be delighted at the vassal trying to redeem the feuduty. Unquestionably, there will be some people in that category. Let us imagine such a person seeking to find some irregularity if the obligation is on the vassal; the vassal will have to do the calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point and the principle of the just return, but I cannot see anything unjust in five times the feuduty. If that is the only objection to the hon. Gentleman's simple amendment, then let us make it six times the feuduty, or seven times. The principle behind the amendment is simplicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There once was a time when Scottish Acts of Parliament sometimes had five lines and some of them lasted for hundreds of years with no loopholes. We seem to have come to an age when the more complicated it is the better it is regarded. I am quite prepared to have extra words, but I suggest that this is too complicated. I cannot see any logical argument against simplicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the formula of the amendment is wrong at five times the feuduty, but I support the principle behind it and make the point that the obligation is laid on the vassal. If the vassal did not send the right money or could not calculate, he may just accept the fact that it is too difficult to redeem the feuduty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I should like to draw to the attention of the Lord Advocate is indirectly related to the problems which are currently being discussed under the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a question to his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, asking:
	<br><blockquote><p>"what has been the basis of the calculation of the value for death duty purposes of the ownership of feus during the past decade."</p></blockquote>
The answer I received, after a little delay, was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The market value of a feu depends on such factors as its size and the location of the property. The value therefore depends on the facts of the particular case."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
This did not seem to provide an answer to that question which I hoped to have for this debate, unless it is to say that the value of a feu for death duty purposes is market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I should like the Lord Advocate to look into is that in certain cases there could be an injustice where a death duty has been paid on the ownership of feus at a rate very substantially more than that which we are very properly thinking of in terms of the Bill. Therefore, it is a matter of tax relationships between the Inland Revenue and individuals. This is shown up by the fact that a large institution or a large proprietor can set the losses it may have in this way against capital gains tax, but someone who has only one feu does not have the buying and selling of a property and valuations and is not making other capital gains against which he can set these losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where these circumstances arise, where the loss is being created, in a sense, by Act of Parliament, for reasons which I entirely support, I think that consideration should be given as to whether losses made in these circumstances could be set against income tax in the ordinary way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The main argument in this short debate, which has been very useful, has been directed to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) in a very straightforward and clear way. I have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment which he seeks to have made to the Bill. The idea of having a simple multiplier is very attractive. On the other hand, the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) rightly put his finger on the difficulty of that sort of formula. However simple and attractive it may appear to be, inevitably there is bound up in it the possibility of injustice and unfairness where there is no social reason at all for introducing any degree of unfairness or injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main criticism is one of detail. The multiplier of five would not be appropriate, although, on the face of it, it is attractive.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
The multiplier of five would be inappropriate particularly because—I have to set this in the wider argument that I present about the 2½per cent. Consols—under the provisions of the Bill as now drafted and of the Bill introduced by the previous administration, the 2½per cent. Consols formula would at present give a multiplier of 6½. That is a more favourable multiplier than it was at the time of the last Bill, as it happens. It has gone down even since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asks why we should not accept the fact that it may go down further, and take the simple multiplier of five. I think that in the present situation to go straight to a multiplier of five, though arithmetically attractive would be wrong, because it would—in view of the formula which has been in the air for so many months now—appear to involve an element of expropriation. One would be taking away —½per cent. from the formula which has been widely publicised and has been widely accepted as being a reasonable basis for a redemption formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend indicated at the beginning that he was flexible on this matter. Perhaps he will be prepared to consider the arguments I have put to him. I listened to his argument; I have sympathy with it, but I think the simple multiplier is not appropriate now. It is not appropriate, for example, in a time of great change in interest rates. It could lead to great injustice. The inflexibility of the rigid multiplier could lead to results two or three years from now quite different from those he contemplates at present. The unfairness can count one way in one economic situation and the opposite way in another. For example, if the change in interest rates is one way it can be unfair to the proprietor; if it is the other way, it can be unfair to the superior.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that this matter has been very seriously considered, and the Government have reached the view that, although it appears to be attractive, the disadvantages are quite considerable, and the injustice created might also be considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I turn to the other aspect, which was argued very cogently to the Committee by the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian—the matter of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
2½per cent. Consols. In regard to the argument which his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) advanced on Second Reading, I would merely reply as I did then. To some extent the argument appears to proceed on the hypothesis that people actually invest the proceeds of the redemption money in this stock. Of course, there is no obligation whatever to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more material point of this argument is why have this particular stock as the basis for the redemption formula. I think the arguments when considered fairly are pretty compelling. The last Government clearly reached this view. The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian may care to have a note of it. The point was put very strongly by the then Lord Advocate Lord Wylie. In the Official Report he will find the reference in the report of the proceedings in the First Scottish Standing Committee, 4th December 1973, columns 146, and 154 to 155. The Government then accepted that the 2½per cent. Consols basis was preferable to the 3½per cent. War Loan, which is the alternative suggested in the amendment we are debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other very cogent arguments relate to the precedents for this type of formula. It is the formula used in the redemption of standard charges under the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925. The 2½per cent. Consols are the normal basis used in legislation for the conversion of annuities to capital and of capital to annuities. The Government annuities' tables are based on 2½per cent. Consols and these tables are used in calculations made for the purposes of the FSSU, federated superannuation scheme for Universities, the Workmen's Compensation Act 1926, the Police Pension Act 1925, the Firemen's Pension Scheme Order 1971 and the Intestate Estates Act 1972. The 2½per cent. Consols are generally accepted as the proper index of the level of the money market. For these reasons, apart from any other, there would appear to be no sufficient grounds for departing from these well authenticated precedents and these well precedented legislatic practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are in addition these reasons. All newspapers which quote stock prices, even the smaller local newspapers, quote 2½per cent. Consols, but many of them do not quote 3½per cent. War Loan. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
are some people who pay both a standard charge and a feuduty. If the 3½per cent. War Loan were adopted for feuduty redemption, there would be an inconsistency between the two. There would be one formula for feuduty and another for standard charge, and that would appear to be inequitable and unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easier to calculate redemption money. This is an arithmetical point which may appeal to the Committee. It is easier to calculate by reference to 23½per cent. than 33½per cent., because it is easier to multiply by four and to divide by 10. That is something that even I can do, but 33½per cent. is not so easy. Perhaps the hon. Lady could ask her husband for an easy formula for calculating at 33½per cent. I do not think there is one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence to suggest that the 23½per cent. Consols formula is not equitable for both parties. It has been accepted as reasonable, for example, by the Church of Scotland, which is a major holder of superiorities. It is the formula, as I pointed out, which has been used very widely in previous statutes, and is used widely in many pension funds, and so on. For these reasons, I hope that members of the Committee will feel that, although there are certain unsatisfactory characteristics about this formula, it is one which meets the equity and fairness of the situation, which, after all, is the most important objective, and if we have slight complications in achieving equity and fairness, surely it is a small price to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I wish to raise is that which I raised when we debated the matter on principle. While I have no objection to the general question of the redemption of feuduties by law when the property is sold for the first time after the passing of the Bill, I believe that there is a strong danger of a grave injustice being done to possible house purchasers; and it is in the interests of the buyers of homes that I make the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause as it stands, when the house is sold for the first time after the passing of the Bill, the vassal who is the seller will have to redeem the amount of the feuduty involved. I submit to the Committee that there is a very strong risk that this amount will be passed on in the price that the purchaser of the house is expected to pay when acquiring the house. At a time of rapidly increasing costs as regards the purchase of homes, even the amount of, say, £100 which might be involved could be a very substantial figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
It may be suggested by the Lord Advocate or by other hon. Members that it is unlikely that, if the seller of a house has decided on a price of, say, £8,000 or £9,000, he would increase the price by £100 simply to take account of the feuduty. The danger as I see it is slightly different. There is a strong danger that, if the house was offered for sale at, say, an upset price of £7,000 and the purchaser offered £7,000, when the missives were to be completed, the seller would accept the offer, subject to the various conditions normally to be found in missives, and one of these conditions might well be that the purchaser of the house should reimburse the seller for the amount that he has had to pay to the superior in order to redeem the feuduty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the figure that we are concerned with, which may be about £100, would not be included in the price of the house but would be an extra condition imposed at a time when the buyer of the house had made an offer which was to be accepted. As we know, the amount of mortgage which the buyer of a house might be able to expect will not take this into account. Many purchasers of homes find it difficult enough as it is to raise the cash required to pay the deposit or the initial amounts required in order to purchase their houses, and if there were to be this extra condition imposed it could prove a serious handicap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is not an argument which goes against the general objectives of the clause. I should be happy to withdraw my objections to the clause if the Lord Advocate would express an interest in seeing before Report whether it would be possible to include in the clause some provision whereby the seller of a house, when redeeming his feuduty, would be prevented from passing on the cost of so doing to a potential buyer. If the Lord Advocate expressed such an interest I should be happy to support the clause as it stands; otherwise I should have grave reservations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting his point so shortly and clearly. I certainly am interested. He posed the problem and suggested the outline of a solution. Frankly, I am doubtful whether an effective solution along those lines could be found, but that will not prevent me from doing my best to find an effective solution, and I undertake to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
It is right, however, to put the matter in the appropriate context. There are two considerations which should weigh here. The first is that new houses in future will be built and sold without any feuduty and that will probably tend to keep the market down. The second is that, as the hon. Gentleman recognised, the amounts of money involved are extremely small compared with the purchase price of houses nowadays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the figure of about £100, which in the case of a house with a purchase price of £15,000 or £20,000 is a very small item. Even in the case of the lower-priced houses or flats, which can still be found for a few thousand pounds, it is a small, comparatively small, amount. In these circumstances, the hon. Gentleman may agree with me that it is unlikely to make any material difference to the general trend of market prices for houses. However, I have expressed the necessary interest to the hon. Gentleman and I hope that the Committee will approve the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 11, in page 8, line 28, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(8) In cases where owners of property enter into agreements with a local authority to sell their property voluntarily and require, in consequence, to redeem their feus, the basis of compensation and calculation of purchase price shall take the cost of redemption into account.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates entirely to a situation in which a house has been acquired by compulsory purchase by the local authority. Its purpose is that, in such a situation, the basis of compensation and the calculation of the purchase price shall take the cost of redemption into account. It seems unfair that, when the owner of a house has been required to sell his home, at no wish of his own, to the local authority which is acquiring it by compulsory purchase, he should, in addition to the general inconvenience and possible finance loss involved, also have—at a time not of his choosing—to redeem the property because of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
requirements of the Bill. It is well known that the general rules of compensation have created a great feeling of injustice amongst many proprietors of homes in Scotland. The purpose of the amendment is simply to ensure that, if the local authority, for good reasons, requires to acquire a property compulsorily, the amount which the owner has to pay to redeem the feuduty should not be a further burden but should be taken into account when determining the proper level of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) is perhaps under a misapprehension as to what the clause in fact provides. The premise of his argument appeared to he that there was a possibility of the cost of redemption being passed on to the ordinary person, as distinct from the authority. That is not the case. If he looks carefully at the wording of the clause he will see that subsection (1) applies to acquisitions of land
	<br><blockquote><p>"by an authority possessing compulsory purchasing powers"</p></blockquote>
and I take it he is satisfied, as his hon. Friend was not, on Second Reading, that that in fact applies to all the bargains, whether private or compulsory, by which an authority of that kind acquires the necessary land. The hon. Gentleman has nodded his agreement to that. In other words, Clause 6 arrangements are to apply not only to those transactions where the acquiring authority actually uses its compulsory powers, but in all cases where it acquires land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) further provides that the clause is to apply
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not there is an obligation to pay valuable consideration—"</p></blockquote>
Accordingly, it will apply whether or not there is any payment or whether it is a gift, and so forth. In each case, whether it is a gift and there is no payment therefor, or there is a payment of some kind by private treaty, or it is a payment under compulsory purchase legislation, the redemption money will be paid by the acquiring authority and the burden of paying it will not rest upon the ordinary subject from whom the land is acquired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, I advise the Committee that the amendment is unnecessary. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
clause as it stands achieves exactly the objective that the hon. Gentleman seeks. Indeed, if one were to try to seek some method whereby this would be prevented from being passed on to the proprietor of the land, there is a risk that it might have the effect of damaging the perfectly clear provisions which already exist. Therefore, I do not think there is the argument which the hon. Gentleman felt there was at first sight. On the general lines of the argument which he presented in regard to Clause 5 one might think of a formula, but here the possibility of a formula would rather damage the clarity of the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is perhaps one of the most important amendments that has been put before the Committee this morning. As the Committee will see, the clause as it presently stands provides for transitional and supplementary provisions to take account of deeds granted in implementation of an obligation entered into before 8th November, 1973, and seeks to ensure that, where an obligation is entered into before that date, and notwithstanding the Bill, the imposition of feuduty will not be forbidden in terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
Clearly it is simply the date involved to which I have taken exception. The date 8th November, 1973 was presumably chosen because that was the date of the publication by the previous Government of their similar Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly the intention of the present Government to maintain this date. My amendment, however, seeks to bring forward the relevant date to 10th April, 1974, which was the First Reading of the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the element of retrospection that I take particular exception to. I can see a good argument for saying that, once a Bill has been published and the contents of that Bill are known to the public, then any superior or individual who wishes to enter into a feudal relationship should take clear account of the intention, or apparent intention, of Parliament to pass legislation of a particular variety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are concerned with under the present wording of the Bill is an attempt by the Government to impose on the public a date which was relevant to a Bill which has totally disappeared as the result of the dissolution of Parliament. Once Parliament was dissolved, I submit that any member of the public who wished to enter into a legal relationship involving a feudal concept was quite entitled to take the view that because of the dissolution of Parliament—indeed, because of the change of Government—the previous legislative programme had little force and could have little effect from then onwards; and until such time as the incoming Government published a similar Bill, declaring an intention to achieve a similar effect, then any agreement entered into prior to that time should have such legal force as would presently apply for any agreement entered into before 8th November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see any argument in terms of fairness or justice for back-dating this provision until 8th November. It was introduced originally only because of the dates involved in regard to the previous Bill. The situation has now changed considerably and the equivalent date would be 10th April of this year. I ask the Lord Advocate very seriously to consider this. He will appreciate that rules involving retrospection are considered to be very undesirable in all but the most exceptional circumstances. I think he will also agree that there is unlikely to have been any major introduc-
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
tion of new agreements of this type between the two dates involved. It is not as though many people took advantage of the dissolution of Parliament in order to enter into any such agreements, but if any individuals did so then they were quite entitled to and it would be wrong and highly unfortunate if Parliament by this clause, were to introduce yet another element of retrospection for a situation that simply did not merit it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) in this matter. I agree with him that it creates an element of retrospection, although it may not be the normal sort of retrospection which one finds. What was logical in the first Bill has, in this Bill, become illogical because there is no reference mark for the date unless one realises that it was originally tied to the dating of the first Bill. It could create—I put it no more strongly than that—unfairness on people who are affected by this clause, where these unfairnesses were specifically excluded before because the original Bill was dated earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the best way of defining our objection is that it appears that the Government, in this instance, are stealing time on a specious reason. That is why I support the remarks and the amendment moved by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) and for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) have put the arguments fairly and squarely. I quite accept the premise which they put forward: that is, other things being equal, there should not be retrospection. One cannot include retrospection unless there is a special reason justifying it. I submit to the Committee that in this case there are very special reasons justifying the very mild degree of retrospection involved in this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be useful if I indicated to the Committee that the effect of the amendment would be to allow deeds which impose a new feuduty to be executed up to 10th April 1976—that is, two years ahead from the earlier date, 10th April 1974—and that would be a different two-year period from the two-year period provided in the Bill which, as the hon. Gentlemen rightly pointed out, is the two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
years which was provided in the Conservative Bill published on 8th November 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentlemen who have spoken accepted the very fair point that there was nothing wrong with 8th November 1973 in the earlier Bill. The argument, therefore, narrows down to the question whether, on balance, it is appropriate to keep that date, with the disadvantage of a slight retrospection, or whether we ought to go, in a full-blooded, straightforward way that the amendment seeks to do, for a new two-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with that I should make two particular points. First,the idea of having a date earlier than the date on which a bill comes into force with the Royal Assent, or later if it is provided in the Bill, is a common one and is not usually regarded as retrospection. It is of course common in Finance Bills, but it is common in other Bills as well to take an earlier date if it was a date when there was publication of a policy to which the Government attached importance and in regard to which they had made a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to hon. Gentlemen who have spoken and who are interested in this subject that the choosing of a date of publication is well honoured in legislation and it is a type of retrospection which is perfectly innocent and carries no kind of sinister connotation whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Bill, although it is a stronger and more powerful weapon than the previous Bill, nevertheless has the same objectives and this aspect of the Bill is quite unchanged. This aspect was intended to safeguard the situation where there has been a contract for the feuing of land over a period of time. Obviously one cannot, without gross unfairness, chop down in the middle of that contract and have no feuduties created over part of the scheme and some created over most parts of the scheme which happen to come earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentlemen will consider the matter for a moment, they will agree that it is better to stick to the original date, when this was stated as a public policy by the then Government and accepted by the Opposition as the appropriate date on which this change of policy should operate. I should have thought that hon. Member opposite would on reflection have thought it right that we should adhere to the previous Government's date in this matter. There is no difference of view on the policy
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
appropriate and there has been no change whatever in the drafting of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, but not least, hon. Gentlemen who were present at the Committee on the last Bill will recollect that the Lord Advocate of the day referred to a possible loophole in the Bill. Perhaps hon. Members who are interested will read the proceedings of the last Committee on the subject. The hon. Gentleman who moved the amendment and the hon. Gentleman who supported him may care to consider that there is a sense in which the Bill cannot be effected even in this regard until the Bill is given Royal Assent. There is some kind of continuing loophole here. I hope that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) who leads for the Opposition will confirm this because, as I understand it, this loophole has not been closed. It would be unfortunate if an additional loophole were opened up by accepting a different commencement date for this essential two-year interim period which must be provided for fairness in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not elaborate the argument. I simply point out that if the amendment is given effect, not only is the loophole spoken about in the last Committee enlarged, but it may invite people—it may need legal ingenuity which is beyond me, but not beyond those interested in making use of such a loophole—to open it up. Obviously such a loophole would be expanded if the amendment were given effect to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentlemen who spoke on this clearly pointed out that, if there are cogent reasons why a degree of retrospection should be allowed, apart from the arguments already deployed, there is room for the amendment to be given effect to. In Committee on the previous Bill, I pointed out on behalf of the Opposition that, dealing with the loophole closely related to this part of the Bill, a future Labour Government reserved the right to introduce retrospective legislation in order to ensure that the loophole was closed. I therefore present the argument to hon. Gentlemen on that basis as well. It was foreshadowed then that the Labour Party would undertake to do the best it could to stop any breach of the gap or opening of the loophole which had been shown to exist. It would be fair to say that we gave notice then, in effect, that if the present Bill were introduced by ourselves, a situation which we did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
envisage, we would present the Bill with the same date of commencement in regard to this clause as the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument which may be more attractive and perhaps more persuasive to hon. Gentleman who has spoken is that in this clause particularly the continuity of intention between the two administrations is clearly embodied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. If he does not do so, I must advise the Committee that, for the reasons I have indicated, we wish the date to remain as it is in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his explanation, but my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) has a certain amount of merit on his side simply because the previous Bill did fall and we are now talking of a new Bill being enacted by a new Parliament. An element of principle is involved here, for one still uses the date for a previous Bill which lapsed because of a General Election and a change in Government. On pure grounds of principle, I have a lot of sympathy with my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say at the same time that I appreciate absolutely the reasons which the right hon. and learned Gentleman put forward. When I had certain responsibilities for handling the earlier Bill, I supported the fact that the effects of the Bill took place in relation to any new arrangements from 8th November. It was the right thing to do, and as the right hon. and learned Gentleman quite correctly pointed out it is a perfectly respectable precedent where the intention has been made absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman two questions. He may not be able to answer immediately, but I should be interested to learn if he can do so. First, I should like to know whether there has been any similar precedent for a Bill of this nature, where there has been this element of retrospection—and a perfectly respectable one—in an original Bill, where the Bill has lapsed because of a General Election and been re-introduced—as the original date for retrospection has been maintained
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
over the passage of the introduction of a new Bill and a new Parliament. I should be interested to know whether there is a precedent for this in other Bills. It might help to guide my hon. Friends as to how we should proceed on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to my second point. I appreciate also that this is probably a fairly difficult one to answer, because to get access to this kind of information would be difficult. Has there been any evidence or talk of any sort of anyone trying to take advantage of the fact that the original Bill lapsed and that the date might be changed to a later one? One could take advantage of a loophole such as this. I appreciate that it might be very difficult to give any guidance to the Committee on this point. It would be helpful to know whether there has been any evidence from any of the professional organisations or others involved in it. I appreciate these are not easy questions to answer on the spur of the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish where I started. As a supporter of the original Bill I am not opposed in any way to the element of retrospection. It is necessary, unless the intentions of the Government are to be thwarted. Certainly very clear notice is given the moment the Bill is published. My hon. Friend was right to raise it this morning in his amendment, because there is a definite change here, a matter of principle in that a Bill has dropped and people in the country may justly conclude that new arrangements will come in later on. They are entitled not to anticipate exactly what might happen but to carry on under the law as it was in the earlier part of this year before any legislation was enacted. For these reasons he was right, but I should be interested to hear what the right hon. and learned Gentleman may have to say on the points I have raised with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Lord Advocate in the matter. Continuity of legislation which I should like to regard as non-controversial is a good policy. It is a good thing to have. One would always want to encourage opposing parties to give assurances of continuity. There would be no real practical advantage in a party giving such an assurance if it makes no difference in the end to the time scale of the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
The second point I want to make in supporting the Lord Advocate is that there was a great dissemination of public knowledge about the intention of this Bill and the previous one. In other words, there was an appetite to get on with redeeming feuduties on the part of very many citizens. It is certainly my experience that many people are waiting to get on with it as soon as they can. It would be a pity if we slowed down the operation when both sides have been anxious to co-operate so well to proceed with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady for the second time today, in fact the second time in my life, that there is a wide desire to see the Bill progress through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the argument of the Lord Advocate is somewhat weakened by virtue of the fact that this Bill was not concluded as part of the legislative programme announced in the Gracious Speech. This is very unfortunate. When I questioned the Secretary of State as to whether the Labour Government would bring in a Bill, in spite of the fact that it was not included in the Gracious Speech he would give me no answer. It was therefore reasonable for people to feel that there was no undertaking that the Government would take up the Bill from the previous Administration and this makes more difficult the questions of practice and principle which we have to consider in the amendment this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the members of the Committee who have raised many interesting points in the course of this short debate. With regard to the point made by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson), I myself do not have a copy of the Gracious Speech and I cannot therefore answer at the moment the point which he made. It would, however, be fair to point out that what is sought to be highlighted in the Queen's Speech is not so much things which may be taken up again from a previous Administration but rather new legislation. I am subject to correction here, but it is not the practice to include in the Gracious Speech Bills other than major ones which might be re-introduced dealing perhaps with a matter in a different way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed the omission from the Queen's Speech of what I regarded as an important measure and I put down a question to the Secretary of State for Scotland as to when he would indicate whether and when he would introduce such a measure, but he was not prepared to give any undertaking. That further emphasises its omission from the Queen's Speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hon. Gentleman is giving a welcome to the Bill this morning, and that I appreciate. The hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) made a useful speech in which she pointed out the desirability of continuity unless there were strong reasons to the contrary. In this particular context, the desirability of continuity is really dominant. I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman who leads for the Opposition in the Committee for what he said on this difficult and important topic. I hope I made it clear that I entirely accept that in the normal case the dates which have been put in the amendment would be the correct dates, but I think he has accepted to some extent that this situation is a very unusual one and that, as the hon. Lady has said, the desire for continuity here is paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The learned Gentleman put two specific questions to me, one about precedents and the other in regard to the possible breaches of the loophole. He asked also whether there had been any representations. I can assure him that there have been no representations of any kind against the provisions in the Bill. That may set at rest some of his doubts. In regard to whether precedents have gone through the loophole, I have no information to the effect that they have. My hope is that they have not, but of course it is still a loophole which can be breached and it is desirable that we should ensure that that loophole is as narrow as possible by maintaining the Bill in the form in which it was drafted. If there is any other point on which I have to inform the hon. Gentleman, I shall be happy to do that in writing before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the first matter which he raised, I cannot offhand produce any precedents for Bills in this particular situation, but I can refer him to the general precedents of publications of White Papers. It has been known in the past on several occasions for Governments to take publication
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
of the White Paper as the operative date for certain provisions of subsequent legislation. Clearly that is a fortiori the present situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely accept the position of the White Paper, but when it has been published in advance of a General Election and legislation takes place after a General Election has intervened, does the right hon. and learned Gentleman feel that this makes a difference? I ask the question entirely for the sake of information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would require notice of that; I shall look into it. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would be only too glad that a Labour Government should adopt the date of publication of the previous Conservative Administration. I used an unfortunate phrase which the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) clearly did not understand; I refer him to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Small) to explain the word that I used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I must invite the Committee to reject the amendment and to take the view, which has been amply supported on the Committee this morning, that the Bill should remain as it has been drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested and not terribly surprised to note that the Lord Advocate was not able to cite any precedent for this. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) raised a perfectly valid point in reference to the omission of any mention of the measure from the Queen's Speech because clearly that would have given an indication to any interested member of the public whether he should work on the basis of this measure being introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am pleased that we have had a full discussion on the matter. I urge the Government not to consider lightly retrospective measures which even they must agree are undesirable in all but the most exceptional circumstances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to be able to achieve broad support from Members on both sides of the Committee. There has already been a considerable number of indications, not least from the hon. Member from Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) and from some of his hon. Friends that there is a very strong need to ensure that as many members of the public as possible are aware of the provisions of the Bill. The hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) made the same point, as did many other hon. Members on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause has a simple and straightforward purpose: to ensure that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all feudal superiors or their agents shall be under an obligation to send a notice to each proprietor explaining that the feuduty can be redeemed and setting out the cost and arrangements for doing this."</p></blockquote>
The Lord Advocate may be able to point to certain insufficiencies or inadequacies in the wording of the new clause. If that was his only objection to it, I should seek to withdraw it to achieve a better phrasing. I hope that he and his hon. Friends will accept that this will not in any way remedy defects in the Bill, because it does not refer to that, but it will add a positive assurance that as many members of the public as can possibly take advantage of the provisions of the Bill will then be in a position to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate has already indicated that it is the Government's intention to publicise the Bill as widely as possible and to leave various notices in libraries and other public places. Even with all those measures, there will be a large number of people, especially elderly people living by themselves or people who do not have access to this kind of information, who would remain in ignorance of the purpose of the Bill. If he would accept the new clause, there would be a complete guarantee that every vassal and every proprietor in Scotland who could benefit from the Bill would know of its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
provisions and would then be in a position to decide what action, if any, he wished to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a controversial matter. Its need has already been referred to by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and I hope the Lord Advocate will be able to give us an assurance that it will receive favourable attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On an earlier amendment which raised the same question, that of the need for publicity and for people knowing their rights, I gave an undertaking and I repeat that undertaking in regard to this matter. I am very anxious that the object of the amendment should be fully achieved by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has certain defects as drafted. It is right that I should point out what these are before I proceed to the substance of the argument to be presented. The wording of the new clause is defective in the respect that it refers to the first Whitsunday or Martinmas after the Act comes into force, and that is not altogether clear, because normally if the wording clearly indicated the first of these days then to eventuate, the ambiguity would be avoided. As it stands, it might be regarded as giving an option for the person seeking to redeem the feuduties to choose either the next term day or a later term day in the same year. That ambiguity vitiates the new clause as it stands. There is a similar ambiguity in regard to the reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"all feudal superiors or their agents"</p></blockquote>
because it is not clear whether that would require notice by one of these or by both. It might be that in order to meet the situation adequately both superiors and their agents would have to give notice. Then there is no provision in the clause for any sanction of any kind against a superior or agent who does not issue a notice. Again, I think, the hon. Gentleman probably on reflection feels that a provision of this sort without a sanction is apt to be legally ineffectual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, lastly but not least, there is a requirement for the notices to be sent to each proprietor. Although one can understand the common sense of what is intended, when one comes to the legal requirement which one would be imposing upon superiors what exactly does that
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
mean? Does it mean every vassal or does it not? This difficulty is inherent in the wording of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not sufficient to dispose of the point that the hon. Gentleman seeks to make in moving the new clause. The gist of it is, is it appropriate and desirable that one should place upon superiors the burden of explaining that feuduty can be redeemed and of setting out the cost of the arrangements for doing it? The Government have considered the matter very carefully and have reached the view that, attractive though it may appear at first, it is undesirable to have a provision of this sort written in to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given an undertaking about the need for the maximum publicity to proprietors of the rights that they will have of redemption under the Bill, and the maximum availability of facilities such as printed forms, guides and the rest which will enable people to exercise these rights. Having regard to all of that, it seems to me that the imposition of this duty upon superiors has to be set in the context that it is not merely a question of large commercial firms and large interests like the Church of Scotland, which are considerable holders of superiorities by way of investment. These are bodies who may well be regarded as having sufficient means at their disposal to be able to exercise a duty of the kind set out in the new clause. One has to consider also, the fact that many holders of superiorities are ordinary small people—for example, the widow round the corner who happens to have a superiority bought by her deceased husband as part of an investment for her future. Such a person—the holder perhaps of one small superiority worth £4 or £5 a year in terms of feuduty—would have this very considerable obligation placed upon her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must look at both sides of the picture. Where as this obligation might not improperly be placed upon superiors who are of substance and who have an infrastructure which would enable them to carry it out, it clearly would not be appropriate in the case of all superiors and all holders of superiorities. For that reason I would urge upon the hon. Gentleman that this solution, which I can well understand him putting forward, is not really appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
Is there an appropriate person to undertake this kind of obligation? I think there is. I think the obligation ought to fall fairly and fully upon the Government. I think the Government have the obligation, when this Bill is enacted, to ensure that all vassals are aware of their right to redeem feud uty and that they should have made readily available to them the means of discovering what the arrangements are and what the approximate cost will be. That is exactly what I would hope would be embodied in the publicity campaign to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the undertaking that I gave to hon. Gentlemen opposite in regard to that matter. Members of the Committee will recollect that I coupled with that the undertaking that, if a solution were found which could improve the Bill as it stands, I should be only too happy to introduce such a solution on Report. Although I think the arguments against this new clause are much more powerful than those against the amendment, I still extend that undertaking to this field as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The maximum of publicity sounds like the solution to the problem of telling people what their rights are. A recent precedent was set under the new legal aid legislation when great publicity was given to the rights of people to consult solicitors at little or no cost if their income was small, and solicitors were encouraged to put a symbolic notice on the doors of their offices. This was so effective for a short time that we were all inundated for the first few weeks of that legislation. One had the experience of watching people coming along a street with great hesitation and looking carefully for this symbol which had been well publicised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was some time ago and the knowledge spread to those who were receptive at that time seems to have diminished almost to the old situation in which most people do not know their rights. It would have to be continuous publicity and it is an extremely expensive arrangement. Even then I question whether all those who really want to redeem their feuduties and who, in their own interests, should do so will ever see the publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make two points. Publicity will always be uncertain, but it is certain that persons who collect fue-
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
duties send demand notes. That is certain whether they are persons of substance or a widow with one feuduty to collect. She or her solicitor sends a demand note. A practical solution would be for the Government to go to the expense, as they intend to do, of publishing guides. I suggest that a printed sheet should be available to superiors at no cost, which they could circulate with each demand note. There would be no extra postage and almost no extra bother for them, except that if they were multiple collectors they would have to collect a big bundle, whereas a widow would collect just one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me a practical suggestion which I should like the Lord Advocate to look at. It gets over the difficulties in the wording of this amendment. I am still for the principle of the amendment because the Bill is trying to achieve a purpose. It is strange to stop short at some arrangement like the one I am suggesting which would make it an obligation on the superior to help to carry out this purpose. It seems strange to go to all this trouble to draft the Bill so carefully and then to stop short at one of the most effective ways of ensuring that all those with feuduties know that they can redeem them on certain terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the principle behind the amendment and I should like to take issue with the effectiveness of any kind of provision, no matter how carefully planned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly support the spirit of this new clause and I am encouraged by the way my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) moved it and by what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said on 17th December;
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should he known that they can do it and how they can do it. It is also important that feuars should realise that no great expense is involved. That is important, because many feuars are old-age pensioners, people who are infirm and living on their own, who are just a bit afraid of bureaucracy, people who will take no action unless steps are taken to bring the advantages of the Bill to their notice."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 17th December, 1973; Vol. 866, c. 1003.]</p></blockquote>
I am quite sure from what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said this morning that we have his full sympathy and understanding on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted by what the hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
(Mrs. Ewing) has said about trying to find some administrative means, such as in the way notices are put out at the time of demanded feu payments, as it is hard to bring it home to people how they can exercise their rights under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said about certain defects in this proposal. I accept his assurance that this is better dealt with administratively than by legislation. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman will give me an assurance that every administrative means possible will be used to try to ensure that people know what their rights are. I would advise my hon. Friend not to press the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In supporting the general principle behind the new clause, I should like to go one stage further than the hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) and impress upon my right hon. and learned Friend that, if he accepts the suggestion that when the demand note is issued a form should also be issued informing a feuar of his rights, could he not also include in that form the approximate cost of redeeming the feu? In view of the complexities of calculating that cost in Clause 4 (2), this information might be very helpful, especially to the elderly and to those not in a position to calculate it for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take careful note of the points made by hon. Gentlemen, and particularly of the point made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I entirely accept his suggestion that it would be desirable to do this by administrative means. I undertake to do what he asks me to do to the best of my ability. I am certain that this matter can be fully considered and I hope that we shall achieve an arrangement which meets all the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take note of the point which my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) made. It would be desirable if it could be done in a satisfactory way. It is obviously a difficult operation. He points to the difficulties in the calculations, but other difficulties are involved. Likewise the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) put a point well worth looking into. I should
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
like to see whether something of that sort could be done, but the difficulties are great, not to provide a simple form, but to get superiors to send them out. I take note of these points and, if the hon. Gentleman withdraws his new clause, I shall be able to get on with it and see how best we can give effect to the Committee's desires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was glad to hear him say that he will give full consideration to these ideas and I hope that he will ensure that the benefits of the Bill, which will be very significant, will be understood by those whom they are supposed to benefit.
