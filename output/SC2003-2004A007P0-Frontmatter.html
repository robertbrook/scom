	<li>After paragraph 7(1) (body must have rules and practices for ensuring company audit work is carried out with integrity and without conflicts of interest) insert—</li>

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>"(1A) The body must participate in arrangements within paragraph 17, and the rules and practices mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above must include provision requiring compliance with any standards for the time being determined under such arrangements."</li></div> <!-- ul -->

	<li>In paragraph 8 (body must have rules and practices as to the technical standards to be applied in company audit work), the existing provisions

	<li>have rules and practices designed to ensure that, where the designated persons have decided that any particular disciplinary action should be taken against a member of the body following the conclusion of an investigation under such arrangements, that decision is to be treated as if it were a decision made by the body in disciplinary proceedings against the member.</li></ol></div> <!-- ul -->

the obligation which would otherwise be imposed on the company under section 288(2) of the Companies Act 1985 (c. 6) (requirement that company notify change among directors to registrar) is instead an obligation of the Regulator.</li>

	<li>But if subsection (10) applies, section 288(2) applies as if the period within which the Regulator must send a notification to the registrar of companies is 14 days from the date on which the Regulator receives notification under that subsection.</li>
