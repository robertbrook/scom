	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 1.</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>—(Restriction on increasing rent and mortgage interest.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>Subject to the provisions of this Act, where the rent of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies, or the rate of interest on a mortgage to which this Act applies, has been since the twenty-fifth day of March, nineteen hundred and twenty, or is hereafter, increased, then, if the increased rent or the increased rate of interest exceeds by more than the amount permitted under this Act the standard rent or standard rate of interest, the amount of such excess shall, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, be irrecoverable from the tenant or the mortgagor, as the case may be:</p>

	<p>Provided that where a landlord or mortgagee has increased the rent of any such dwelling-house or the rate of interest on any such mortgage since the said date, but before the passing of this Act, he may cancel such increase and repay any amount paid by virtue thereof, and in that case the rent or rate shall not be deemed to have been increased since that date.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after the word "dwelling-house" ["where the rent of any dwelling-house"] to insert the words "or business premises"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee who were present when the right hon. Gentleman moved the Second Reading of this Bill on Friday last will remember he told us that he expected hostility on two vital points, one being the suggestion that rents should be increased, and the second the fact that business premises were omitted from the scope of the measure. I think myself, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
regards the first point, the right hon. Gentleman was wrong. I do not believe there is any general hostility, either in the House or in the country, to a reasonable increase in rent. The landlord has got to be protected as well as the tenant, and, with the possible exception of what I may call organised labour, I do not think there is any great objection to a reasonable increase in rent. As far as organised labour is concerned, that can protect itself, because a rise in prices means for labour a rise in wages. As to the second point, why business premises have not been brought within the scope of this Bill, there, certainly, I think the right hon. Gentleman was right. The fact that they are omitted has given rise throughout the country to a very great deal of disappointment and discontent. The right hon. Gentleman told us, and I think rightly so, that it is not a very controversial point, although it is one of enormous importance. I agree it is really very controversial, but the average layman cannot understand why business premises should be omitted, and some very good reason ought to be given for such a course. Neither the Salisbury Commitee, on whose report this Bill has very largely been based, nor the right hon. Gentleman himself were at all convincing in the reasons they gave against the inclusion of business premises. I will just quote to the Committee the reasons that the Salisbury Committee gave why business premises should not be included:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We feel that steps should be taken to check the profiteering in business premises which is taking place in London and other towns at the present time, and we have the fullest sympathy with the grievances of tenants of business premises who without good and sufficient cause are dispossessed and deprived of the goodwill attaching to these premises. But, having regard to the wide extension of the scope of the Acts which the inclusion of business premises would involve, and to the power of the tenants of these premises in many cases to pass on to the public in the shape of increased fees or prices the whole or part of any increased burden thrown upon them, the provisions of the Rent Restriction Acts seem to us to be unsuited to this class of property"</p></blockquote>
That is what the Salisbury Committee considered, and it is what the right hon. Gentleman said in his speech last Friday. I should like to point out this, that the Salisbury Committee certainly appears to have forgotten there is such a thing as a Profiteering Act, and that it might not be altogether easy for a small business man who has had his rent increased,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
or has even been put to the expense of getting alternative premises elsewhere, to pass on that particular cost to his customers. He might be had, I imagine, under one of the Profiteering Acts, and, even if he were not, he might lose a certain amount of custom. After all, we like to continue to trade with the man who has supplied us with goods in a satisfactory fashion for a certain number of years, but if his charges become too high, and if there is another man close by selling the same goods at lower rates, we are apt to transfer our custom to the new man, to the loss and detriment of our old friend. The main point, as I remember, of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman was this: that nearly all business premises, whether offices or shops would be outside the scope of this Bill. It is true that that would be so in the London and Metropolitan area where the rent standard would be higher than £105 per year. I quite admit that if we had been dealing with the original limit of £35 what the right hon. Gentleman said would be true. The average office or shop, lock-up or otherwise, would be outside the scope of the measure. But even supposing that be so, even supposing the average business office or shop be outside the scope of the Bill, and therefore any attempt at bringing it in would be useless until you have got an extension of the Bill, what is true of these offices and shops is equally true of dwelling houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any member of this Committee were to take a walk from here down Victoria Street and look to the right or left in those great regions where flat dwellers live—say at Ashley Gardens—he would find that there is hardly a single flat in that particular locality which is not let at the present moment at a great deal more than £105 per year, and dwellers in those flats are outside the scope of this Bill. I venture to suggest that that these are the very class we want to try to protect, namely, the new poor. If it be difficult to get a flat or house at a rental either under £100 or over £100, may I say that it is equally difficult to get new offices or shops at the same figure. I have in mind a large block of buildings, again in Victoria Street. The buildings are unusual in this respect, that they consist of offices and residential flats mixed together in
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
higgledy-piggledy fashion. On one floor you will find rooms used for business premises, while another part of the same floor is let for residential purposes. That particular block of buildings has been acquired by a great business firm a few yards away, and all the tenants have been given notice to quit. What is the effect? The man who has his offices there, even supposing he is not paying more than £70 or £80 a year as rent, has got to go; he has, as a matter of fact, already gone. In the case of the residential flats where the rents are well under £100 a year, although perhaps in equity they ought to be over that amount, those tenants cannot be turned out, or, if they are turned out, the people who have acquired this great block of buildings must find alternative accommodation for them elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position of the business people? I remember perfectly well that exactly this time a year ago I and some of my friends were running round London, trying to get modest business offices for a political concern in which we were interested. I went to agent after agent, and all of them treated our application with scorn. They said that such accommodation as we were asking for was not to be had. The result was that we had to take premises far too expensive, and in some respects not altogether suitable for our purpose. What happened to us at that time is happening to business men now. Let me take another case, I would ask members of the Committee to imagine a building containing three lock-up shops, used respectively by a tobacconist, a grocer and a hairdresser, and let at a rental of £80 per annum. This building is situated in a London suburb. Over each of the lock-up shops is a residential flat let at a rent of £120 Imagine somebody desiring to acquire the site for the purposes of, say, a cinema, and buying the whole building. This means, of course, that the tenants of the shops will have to go, while the occupants of the flats, being outside the scope of the provisions of this Bill, will also have to go. I would ask the Committee to consider which of these six sets of tenants will suffer the greatest hardship? Will it be the three occupants of the residential flats who are now paying £120 per year, or will it be the tenants of the three lockup shops below? The people who have to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
turn out of the flats will, of course, be put to great inconvenience. They will have to hunt about for other suitable accommodation. The change may mean the temporary break up of the family, the breadwinner going into lodgings, and the wife and children going to the country or to the seaside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a certain amount of discomfort and inconvenience and probably hardship, but what about the men who occupy the shops? What about the tobacconist, the grocer and the hairdresser, who, perhaps, by dint of ten years' hard work have managed to build up their businesses, to secure a number of clients, and, it may be, to become popular in the neighbourhood? They are to be turned out, and for them it may mean not merely suffering, but disaster, which is far worse than the fate of the occupants of the residential flats. I think that no case has been made out for excluding business premises from the scope of this Bill. Members of the Committee know quite well, and so does the right hon. Gentleman, that the business man, the shopkeeper, is pressing for a reform which he considers is long overdue. He wants legislation introduced on the lines of the Town Tenants (Ireland) Act, and he wants to get the same protection as has been extended to his Irish 
	<i>confrere.</i> He has been promised that for many years. He holds a promise to that effect from the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet—from men on both sides of politics. He has been promised that at the earliest possible opportunity the pledge given six or eight years ago shall be redeemed. The right hon. Gentleman now promises business men and shopkeepers a Select Committee to enquire into what should be done to meet their grievances and difficulties. Surely a Select Committee is not wanted to do this. It could be done by simply introducing the necessary legislation and not after the long delay of a Select Committee, but at any rate at present the small business man and the shopkeeper—and there is such a thing as the small man of business and the shopkeeper in a small way of business—want the protection afforded to them, limited though it may be, by this Bill. I received a Deputation the other day from the London and Suburban Retailers Association, who are able to speak for
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
some 50,000 individuals in London and the Suburbs, and they pressed me emphatically to do my level best as one of their Vice-Presidents to get this Amendment carried. A great deal will have happened within three years, but at present business premises and offices are not being built and shops, whether lock-up or otherwise, are not being built, and therefore the people who are turned out of their present premises are very hard put to it to get alternative accommodation. In three years it may be different. Buildings may be shooting up all over the country and the pressure probably will have relaxed, but at present it is there and despite the right hon. Gentleman's promise of a Select Committee I suggest that they should now include business premises in the scope of this Bill and give a much needed protection to the small business man and the shopkeeper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>THE MINISTER OF HEALTH (Dr. Addison)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps before replying to the Amendment I might say a word as to the position of the Bill and ask the Committee to take its proceedings into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want any discussion on that matter, but a statement as to what the Government proposes would probably be useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is that this Bill must be on the Statute Book by the end of the present month and necessarily an interval must elapse, as short as we can make it, between the Committee Stage and the Report, and it is evident that it is most desirable to make as rapid progress as we can in the Committee. This is a most difficult matter and large numbers of the Amendments raised really important questions meriting careful examination. I should be the last to suggest that any of these matters should be too lightly dealt with. Therefore if we are to give the Bill the consideration which it should have, and at the same time try to get it forward without delay, I would ask the Committee if they would be willing to devote more time to it than under our normal procedure. As a rule Committees only sit twice a week. I should be very glad if the Committee could see their way to sit daily. In consequence of an engagement made a long time ago I had to introduce a number of foreign delegates to His Majesty this morning and we were com-

pelled to meet an hour late. I should be most grateful if the Committee could sit not only this morning but this afternoon. Perhaps at four o'clock we might meet again for an hour and a half and at the end of our proceedings we could discuss our future sittings. The matter is most urgent and critical and a great deal of time must be required in discussing these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now turn to the Amendment. I had some little difficulty in following the hon. and gallant Gentleman's argument. It appeared to be somewhat a patchwork of logic. I was trying to see what policy he had in his mind, and if it meant anything it meant that all premises, whether houses or shops, of any value ought to be dealt with by this class of legislation, because he talked about flats in Ashley Gardens and elsewhere and others that were of a higher rent. I understand that the rents of the flats are higher than the standard here permitted and that the business premises are in the same position, so that it is not simply a question of the hairdresser that he described. His argument if it meant anything applied generally to premises. That is really the logical and proper interpretation of his speech. I would ask the Committee really to face that issue. I think he stated with great justice the case that holders of business premises had long standing grievances which have evoked pledges from time to time, I think I may say, from leaders of all political parties, and I entirely agree with them that it is right and necessary, especially just now, that we should seek to have those grievances dealt with. The Government agree to that, but notwithstanding his argument you cannot deal with those grievances simply by putting the words "business premises" into this Bill. Some business premises are held on lease. Nothing in the Bill disturbs any existing covenant, and unless the lease expires none of the conditions set out in the Bill apply. It is a long standing grievance of tenants of business premises, with which I entirely sympathise, that they may during the tenure of their lease have built up a business and then they may find themselves either exposed to what they feel to be some unwarrantable increase of rent or they may have to move elsewhere and lose the whole of the goodwill which they have laboriously created.
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
That brings up all kinds of questions as to goodwill, compensation, conditions of tenure and so forth of a highly intricate legal character and when I looked into them most carefully before deciding to keep them out of the Bill I was appalled at their complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a Lawyer, so that I may have been more easily shocked than a trained lawyer, but if the hon. and gallant Gentleman thinks you can deal with these issues that 
	<i>bona fide</i> arise in connection with the termination of leases, the goodwill of businesses and all the other matters that must be dealt with in connection with that set of questions by simply putting the words "business premises" into the Bill he is under a great misapprehension. Immediately you put those words in at least 20 issues will crop up, not one of which is dealt with in the Bill at all. If you put them in you would have to recast the whole measure. That is not an exaggeration, but a moderate statement of the truth. You cannot do it in that way. I am sorry you cannot, but you cannot. We looked into this with great care and with the best goodwill to see what we could do in respect of business premises and it was quite evident that the legal questions which arose in many directions were of an entirely different kind and you could not deal with them in a measure of this kind. You would only land yourself in a bog of difficulties and you would not help either the tenant or anyone else if you tried to put all that in and rushed through a Bill based on legislation, as this Bill is based, which was directed to entirely different issues. It is quite impossible to deal with that kind of thing in this way. Notwithstanding what the hon. and gallant Gentleman has said, he cannot lightly pass over either these considerations or even the deliberations of Lord Salisbury's Committee. They heard a great many witnesses and spent a great deal of time on this, and they deliberately, and I believe somewhat reluctantly, came to the conclusion that they could not deal with it in this way, and I am quite sure that was a sound conclusion. The hon. and gallant Gentleman has not replied to the contention which I put forward on the Second Reading, which is a thoroughly sound contention, that the tenant of a dwelling house is by the nature of his case in an entirely different position from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
man who is conducting a business. It is not a question of profiteering at all. If the hon. and gallant Gentleman's suggestion meant anything it meant that when a man in charge of a business passed on his overhead charges to his customers in the way of sale prices he was in some way profiteering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He might be charged with profiteering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he certainly could not. Any man who conducted his business on any other lines would inevitably land himself in the Bankruptcy Court. Anyone who conducts a business is bound to put into his charges ingredients like rent, taxes, wages, insurance, which must be represented in the price of his goods, and any business man who conducted his business on any other principles soon would not have a business to conduct because he would be in the Bankruptcy Court. There is no profiteering in that. That is essential to the conduct of any business. It is when he does it in an extortionate and unreasonable way that it is a question of profiteering. A man in business is bound to pass on his overhead charges to his customers, otherwise his business would stop, but the tenant of a house is not in a position to do it. He is merely a tenant for the purpose of dwelling accommodation and he cannot pass on his rent or rates to anyone else. The case is fundamentally different. It is true that where a man has a shop as part of his dwelling house it is included, but the reason is that you cannot separate the two. It is the man's dwelling house and it is dwelling houses that we are looking after. The Government have decided to set up this Select Committee and we propose to put on the Order paper, I hope this afternoon, the terms of reference to the Select Committee. I have a draft of them here. I should not like to read them as there is perhaps one part of them which may conceivably be altered but the Committee will enquire into the position of tenants of business premises, and they will be asked to consider questions affecting tenure, improvements, protection against unreasonable increases in rent, and matters of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference to the Select Committee will cover this particular grievance, which we all know has been the subject of pledges by men of all parties. Until we get some common measure of agreement
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
on that kind of question, and I feel sure the Select Committee is the best way to obtain it, we shall simply throw into the midst of our debates an old-standing subject of strife, and we shall get no further at all. Therefore, the only way to deal effectively with the grievances arising in this class of case, as far as they are grievances, is to try to get a sufficient measure of agreement so that we can get a Bill and get it passed as the result of their recommendations. Such questions of leasehold enfranchisements have been argued on every political platform in the country for twenty years, and it is because we want to deal with it in a 
	<i>bona fide</i> way that we consider this is the best method of approach. I am sure it is. We mean business in this matter. I ask the Committee not to wreck this Bill, as they would do if they put business premises in, because that would bring in all sorts of intricate legal questions which do not arise under this Bill at all. Therefore, I must resist the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->

Are you going to make an exception for the sake of the 3 per cent. and bring in all sorts of difficulties which are innumerable? Many of us would like to deal with those difficulties, and we ought to deal with them, but if we try to deal

	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
with them in a temporary measure like this we are going to wreck the Bill. I do not believe you would get either House to pass this Bill unless you made very great safeguards if you include business premises. Reference has been made to Ashley Gardens. Are you going to take up the millionaires' flats? The millionaire can well look after himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the flats in Ashley Gardens, if they are not flats for millionaires, are flats for a number of Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new poor!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt they are sympathetic on that point, but I would not support it on that ground. Moreover, you have included in the Bill something that has not been done in the other Bills, and that is, you have excluded the rates wherever they are applicable. It has been held by the Courts that where the rent included rates it was covered, but now you purposely exclude that. Therefore you may say that the £105 does not represent £105 in the Acts that are being repealed by this Bill; nearly so much. You might say that this is equal to £125 or £130 maximum. Therefore you get protection for these places. If you desire to wreck the Bill there is no better way of wrecking it than to include business premises. You are there up against a proposition with which it is most difficult to deal. Governments have considered that question for years, and other people have considered it, and the result has been that it has been found so difficult to deal with that you cannot possibly deal with it in a temporary measure of this sort. The standard rent or rate of the value is the measure by which you are going to measure these increases or amounts. Before you begin to deal with business premises you should have an enquiry so as to cover the whole ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the hon. and gallant Member was fair in his quotation from the Salisbury Report. In paragraph 13, dealing with business premises, shops, and offices, they say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence, however, which we received from witnesses representing the Town Tenants' League, was to the effect that, although the war had accentuated their grievances, their grievances existed prior to
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
the war and could not be removed by the mere application of the Rent Restriction Acts to business premises. They stated that the war had brought about a difficulty with regard to the tenants of business premises under short-term tenancies owing to the appreciation of property, and that while this particular difficulty might be met or mitigated by the extension of the Rent Restriction Acts, such a remedy "would only deal with the fringe of a vast problem"</p></blockquote>
The Commission came to probably the only conclusion at which they could arrive. If my right hon. Friend asks them to continue and to form the nucleus of a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole matter then you will probably get something that will be concrete and you will be able to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. GRAHAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am exceedingly reluctant to take up the time of the Committee, because I desire that we should make as rapid progress as possible. I should not have risen but that I feel there is an intermediate course which perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be willing to consider. When he makes reference to property of an important character and property of elaborate leaseholds I have no difficulty in agreeing with him, and if we tried to apply this Bill to property of that sort we should create the difficulties to which he referred. We must look at the plain facts of the Bill, and remember that people who reside on business premises, where the premises form part of their dwelling house, have protection. There is another class of shop property which we have in Scotland, and which probably can be found in many parts of England, which we think must be protected, if it be possible, under a Bill of this nature. In Scotland a very great deal of shop property was not let under elaborate leases at all. There was a great surplus of shop accommodation of all kinds in many Scottish centres, with the result that shops were standing empty, and the process which was adopted in a good many cases was to let the shop from year to year, or for even shorter periods, to tenants who took the chance of doing what business they could in these localities. There is no doubt that to a considerable extent that principle has survived, and we are confronted with the case of the small shopkeeper who does not reside on his premises, and who is under a comparatively humble rental at the present time, but who absolutely depends upon that property for his living from week to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
week and from year to year. Within recent times the hardship has been intensified. In many cases the property has been sold over the heads of the tenants and in other cases they have received demands for such increased rentals that they could not possibly afford to pay them. Side by side with that development the un-let property in their localities has disappeared, and they are confronted with the choice of paying a rental which is altogether beyond their powers or being turned into the street, thereby losing the opportunity of earning a livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak for English conditions, but I have knowledge of Scottish conditions, and probably the same state of affairs will be found south of the Tweed. In a very large number of cases these small shopkeepers are physically incapacitated. They cannot turn to any other occupation. They absolutely depend upon the premises which they occupy, and unless they are afforded some protection I see nothing but the workhouse, the street, unemployment doles, or whatever other provision the State may make for them. They have toiled for many years, and have paid their local rates and taxes, and in the main they have been worthy and well-doing citizens, and we should not depart from this proposal without very carefully considering their case. I recognise the fact that the right hon. Gentleman has proposed a Select Committee to deal with shop property and business premises. That enquiry must take considerable time; it must be an elaborate enquiry if it is to be worth anything. In the meantime could we do anything within the narrow limits of rental to protect this class of people? If we do not do that, if we wait for the report of the Select Committee, our opportunity is gone, they will be in the street; they will have lost protection. There is an intermediate course if we could fix a modified rental and give these working people the protection which they deserve without in any way endangering this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. BURN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to render any assistance in wrecking this Bill.

place in Belfast. The rent in 1914 was £23. Since then it has been increased to £33 10s., afterwards to £60, and now the tenant is under notice to quit or to pay £200 a year. In cases of this character, where notices to quit have been served, some means must be adopted in this Bill to prevent these notices from being carried out, otherwise in a great many instances small business people will be thrown out of employment, their business will be absolutely lost, and they will have a struggle and very hard work to make a livelihood. Can the right hon. Gentleman give the Committee some assurance that these notices to quit will be stayed, or that some protection will be given to these business premises and offices pending the report of a Select Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. SEDDON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the hon. Member for Edinburgh (Mr. W. Graham). I think there is a very strong case that can be made out for the class of person to which he refers. My right hon. Friend has pressed too much the difficulties. I admit there are great difficulties. He based the strongest part of his argument upon leasehold properties. In the provinces, for what applies to Scotland applies to many parts of England, there are yearly tenancies and in many cases weekly tenancies. These are the small class of people who are feeling the full blast of the profiteering that is going on. Surely it is not beyond the bounds of draftsmanship to include that class of shop, and to associate it with the shop which is coupled with the occupied house, without entering upon the vexed question of leaseholds. It would be possible to draft an Amendment whereby these people who are subject to weekly or yearly tenancies could come under the same provisions as the man who occupies a shop and lives on the premises above. The right hon. Gentleman seems to think that the small shopkeeper stands in the same relation to the large shopkeeper, but he does not. The small shopkeeper who is the victim of 90 per cent. of this enormous profiteering, in the majority of cases is the proprietor of some small huckster's shop. They are mostly people who have passed the middle of life, and they have gone into this class of business to protect them from the workhouse in their old age, and the amount they receive from the sale of their goods leaves them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
very little to live upon. These people cannot pass this increased charge on to their customers because, if they do, they will lose their trade altogether. They are a great convenience to the poor people, they are saving the community extra taxation, and to meet these cases I think it is possible so to amend the Clause that businesses upon a weekly or yearly tenancy shall come under the same provision as is laid down for those premises occupied by the owner who is living on the premises. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will readily understand that I do not want to delay the passing of this Bill, but these are heart-breaking cases, and if anything can be done for them without injuring the Bill I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will be doing a great service to a large section of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. TREVELYAN THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to join in the appeal which has been made on behalf of the small shopkeeper. There are in the provinces of England, Wales and Scotland, a large number of small shopkeepers who deserve the same protection as we are extending to houses, because their position is due to the abnormal conditions of the war. It has been argued that the shopkeeper can increase his price, but surely he has no option in the matter whatever when he receives notice to quit. Often he has not the option of paying the higher rent because he is told to clear out and he can find no other premises. To suggest that he should be encouraged to transfer this increase in his rent to his customers is unfair, because we are all trying to reduce prices. He has not the opportunity, however, of doing that because he has no other business premises to which he can go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the right hon. Gentleman can help us to frame some amendment to meet this point. I have a new clause down on the paper providing that where the occupier of business premises receives notice he can go to arbitration as to whether he has been asked to pay an equitable increase in rent or not, and if the court decides upon a certain figure and he is prepared to pay it, then he cannot be moved out of his premises. That is one method and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will be able to help us. This is not merely a question of the small shopkeepers but also of the small profes-
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
sional man with an office, and in many cases a man with a small workshop or factory, and surely these people require the same protection. I join in the appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to meet us on this point, because it is a very real difficulty in the provinces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. G. JONES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cordially support this amendment and I propose to vote for it if it be persisted in, no matter what may be the result to the Bill, unless we get some assurance that some relief is going to be given to the business community. It will be some months before the Select Committee reports, and what will happen in the meantime to the people whose tenancies have expired? I will give an illustration. I know of a man who was carrying on a business in a warehouse rented at £70 a year. He received notice to quit and he could not get other premises. He went round to the landlord, and almost on his knees asked to be allowed to continue as the tenant because of the goodwill attached to his business, but he was told "you can stop on if you pay £500 a year instead of £70" I submit that that sort of thing is perfectly intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the big banks in the city are coming along, and taking the premises from which these small business men have been removed, and they are taking them at extortionate rents. I suggest that a short Bill might be passed preventing these people being disturbed until the Government bring in their new Bill. There will be no difficulty about this. All you need provide is that no order shall be made for possession in the case of these business premises if certain conditions are complied with. It has already been pointed out that this question not only affects tradesmen, but a large number of professional men in the City of London who find their rent going up in some cases as much as ten times the ordinary rent. The hon. Member for St. Pancras (Mr. Lorden) says that 97 per cent. of these people are already protected by the Bill, but so far as my observation goes that is a very great exaggeration. May I make a suggestion which I do not think would tend to wreck this measure. We are already protecting houses of £105 rental, and we are protecting premises which consist of a shop and a dwelling-house together. Could we not also provide for the addition of lock-up shops and offices in the same way as we protect houses up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
to £105 rental? I cannot see why we should not take in offices, shops, and factories in this way. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman is very seriously underestimating his own ability when he says that this matter is too complicated to deal with in this Bill. The right hon. Gentleman has argued that the business community are not entitled to so much sympathy because they can pass the burden on to their customers. I am surprised and pained to hear the Government advocating that people should be compelled to pay such extortionate charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We all sympathise with the cases which have been put forward, but the way to deal with the matter is to have a special Clause referring to shops, and not attempt to do it by inserting an Amendment at this point.

On behalf of the Scottish members I must express my surprise that the Secretary for Scotland is not here. My right hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will bring this matter to the notice of the Secretary for Scotland and represent to him the views which the hon. Member has expressed on this point. With reference to the arguments which have been used, I wish to say that in my judgment, if you are going to deal with shops, you must do so irrespective of any question of the rental of a particular shop While the rent is a fair test as regards a tenant who no doubt takes his house according to his means, it is a very different test indeed to apply to business premises. For instance, you might have a bookmaker renting an office at £20 a year who would come within the protection of this clause, while on the other hand you might have a bootmaker who has to have a large shop to display his goods, who might come outside the limitation. Therefore if you pursue this matter to its logical conclusion you must either include all shops, offices, and factories, or none of them. The moment you attempt to apply the rental test you get into a very great difficulty indeed, and you might be really creating more hard-

ships than you are remedying. Really most of the difficulties and hardships which affect shopkeepers to-day are matters which cannot be incorporated within the scope of this Bill. The Government have promised to set up a Committee within the next few days, and we are going to urge this Committee immediately to report from the point of view of the shopkeepers. A great deal has been done to remedy these difficulties at the present time. My hon. Friend below me suggested that there should be differential treatment for those who have weekly or yearly tenancies. I again say that that would be a very wrong differentiation to make, as a small shopkeeper with a three years' agreement or less might be excluded by my hon. Friend's suggestion, and that, I submit, is not a fair alteration or test to make. Directly one examines this proposal, and especially if one has listened to the speeches made this morning in this Committee, he must be immediately convinced that we are embarking upon a most difficult subject—one which, above all others, ought only to be dealt with after proper examination and investigation by a Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that the subject is so difficult and so complicated, that it is almost impossible to get a fair and right solution of the claims of the tenant, with, at the same time, proper consideration for the position of the landlord, it does seem to me, fully apprised as I am of the difficulties of the shopkeepers at the present time—and I have had many cases of hardship in the City of London brought to my notice—that it would be better to leave this matter to be dealt with by a Committee of experienced men. That, to my mind, would be a step in the right direction. Members of this Committee, however, may feel satisfied that at any rate a very big percentage of the people we desire to protect are protected by this Bill. I will not pledge myself to the percentage which has just been mentioned. I venture to say there are very few village shops up and down the country where the shopkeeper does not live on his premises, and I think it would be well within the mark to claim that between 85 per cent. and 90 per cent.—in fact, the vast majority of the small shopkeepers of the country—will be protected by this Bill. I honestly think that the Committee would be wise, having
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
regard to the experience we have already had in connection with legislation of this kind, to hesitate before they ask that factories, shops and offices be included in this Bill. We have already had a good deal of experience of this kind of legislation. While it is necessary, it has brought a good deal of hardship in its train. There is no doubt about it that there are large numbers of cases where operations of the Acts we are dealing with this morning have been most unfair. It is difficult to avoid that in passing exceptional legislation at this time for exceptional times bring with them a great many more difficulties. When you have regard to the fact that probably 85 per cent. of the small shopkeepers of the country will be covered by the Bill, and that you are going to have an expert Committee immediately set up to examine into and report upon the question at an early date, I think the Committee may feel satisfied this morning with having again ventilated this particular class of grievance, and with having assured itself that steps in the right direction are being taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Captain COOTE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help feeling a little bit disappointed with the reply of my hon. Friend. I agree with him entirely that shops and business premises should be treated as a whole. But that is no answer to the arguments put forward by the mover of the Amendment. I have not been very long a Member of this House, but I can never remember a Government getting into a difficulty and not trying to jettison its cargo by means of a Select Committee. That is what, evidently, they are trying to do in this case. After all, it is not only the small people who have to face this difficulty. They are not the only people who ought to be protected. Everybody is entitled to protection, and if the Bill be meant, as I believe it is, to prevent undue advantage being taken by a landlord of the shortage of houses, then everybody ought to be protected, and not merely one class alone. We are not here to pass class legislation. May I suggest, if this Select Committee be set up by the Government, that at any rate a time limit should be fixed for the presentation of its report. That would go some way to meet an objection which I feel very strongly. I cannot vote conscientiously against this Amendment, after the reply we have received from the Government. It seems to me that their

	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
arguments seek to justify the treatment of shopkeepers and business men on a different footing from tenants of ordinary dwelling houses. What is meant when it is suggested that shopkeepers can pass their increased charges on to the consumer? It means that while the cost of living is being decreased at one point by this Bill, it is being increased at another point. I was sorry to hear my right hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY GORE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend who last spoke that the reply we have had is very unsatisfactory. My hon. Friend protested against the argument of logic which had been forward, but at the end of his speech, he proceeded to tell the Committee that 85 per cent. of the small shopkeepers were already covered by the Bill. Where does the argument of logic come in? We are told you cannot deal with one class of business premises without dealing with all business premises, yet we are dealing in this Bill with one type of dwelling houses, and not with all types of dwelling houses. Why should we not deal with shops on exactly the same lines, especially as we are dealing with shops which form part of dwelling houses that come under this Bill? Why cannot the 15 per cent. of shops which are not covered by this Bill be included in it? I admit it is opening the door to factories and that kind
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
of thing; it is opening the door very widely indeed, but could not that difficulty be met by the Government introducing a special clause dealing solely with the 15 per cent. of small lock-up shops whose case is so very urgent? We know that big businesses are undoubtedly very hard hit, but then they can afford to await the report of the Select Committee. There are, however, a large number of cases of small shopkeepers who have already received notice to quit. I am referring to what were known during the War as one-man businesses, and I do hope that the door will not be shut by this Committee and thus prevent these cases being specifically dealt with. If the hon. Member for Central Edinburgh (Mr. W. Graham) can suggest a 
	<i>via media,</i> I shall be glad to support him, but I cannot support this Amendment, although I do think the Government should do something to coyer the 15 per cent. of cases to which reference has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Major M. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Amendment be accepted it will result in a very serious differentiation between England and Scotland. This question has already been thought out as regards Scotland. When we were fighting this particular battle between five and six o'clock one morning we did not have the support of hon. Members who are raising it now. May is the term in Scotland, and it was pointed out to the Government that unless some sort of Bill were introduced before May, Scotland would not get the benefit of this Rent Restrictions Act. The result was that a Suspensory Bill was introduced and passed. We tried to get it extended to include shops, but we were unsuccessful. If this Amendment be accepted it will result in England getting the benefit of the Restriction of Rents in regard to shops and Scotland being left out, because such an Amendment will be of no value at all to Scotland until May of next year. All shops there are taken on a yearly tenancy, and any shopkeeper who is threatened with eviction will be there until next May. It may be that a few may have their tenancies terminated in Novem-

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of my hon. Friends have not quite done us justice. We sympathise with this grievance as acutely as anyone does. It is not because one does not appreciate the grievance that one has had with great reluctance to take the line I have taken. One is reluctant because one does appreciate the grievance, but the question is whether this is the right way of dealing with it, and I am convinced it is not. I think hon. Members, while pressing me to accept the Amendment, have not really faced the consequences of the passage of such an Amendment, which are inevitably very profound. We cannot half do a thing. With respect to passing on charges to customers, I think my hon. Friend is losing sight of the main purpose of these Acts, which was to secure people against eviction from their dwelling houses, and we had to place a rental limit, so as to define the class of house. The fundamental difference between a shopkeeper and a dweller in a house with regard to rental limit is this. We have arbitrarily restricted the rents of dwelling houses. In the case of an arbitrary restriction of the rent of any other premises a shopkeeper would, if the rent were raised, pass it on to his customers, but the inhabitant of a dwelling house could not do so, and therefore there is in that respect a fundamental difference between the two sets of people. I am not wanting to profiteer any more than my hon. Friends. I am only pointing out a fact in the situation from which you cannot escape by any formula. A tenant cannot pass on the increase on a dwelling house, but in the case of a shop he can. I really could not, knowing what it will mean, accept this Amendment. It would ruin the whole Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the general feeling of the Committee, and I will discuss it with my colleagues and see if I can bring in anything. I am not making a promise, but I will

standing that whatever is brought up would have to be limited to any premises other than dwelling houses, if we could propose anything at all, which were not beyond the rental limit otherwise applicable to the Bill, and that the duration of the application of anything that could be suggested would be limited' either to a definite period or pending the introduction of other legislation. With those two limitations I will further explore the matter with my colleagues with the best good will. I do not want it to be held that I am promising to bring something up, but I will try to see if we can, with this strict limitation and on that strict understanding. I will do my best to explore it from that point of view, but I do not feel I can possibly go any further than that. I will do that in sincerity and goodwill, and see if we can evolve anything which will be less mischievous than I am certain this Amendment will be.

We have been discussing the rights of the shopkeepers. Every business man, whether he has an office in the City or a shop, has to face the fact that whenever his rates and taxes and rent go up, it goes on his business. It is all moonshine to say it does not. But the difficulty we are in is this. Where a commercial firm has sent out its travellers, and fixed the price of its goods, and then received notice from the landlord to say that the rent will be increased from £400 to £1,750 a year, they have not had an opportunity of putting that on because their goods have gone out. We have scores of cases where this thing has got

From what he said, I imagine he is going to carry out exactly what I want. I merely want these particular people to be brought within the scope of the Bill. We have heard rather too much in this Debate about the shopkeeper. I admit that the average shopkeeper does live upon his premises, and, therefore, he is within the scope of this Bill. We have not talked about the business man, the professional man. That is one of the cases we have to meet, just as much as that of the shopkeeper. If he be evicted he has nowhere to go. It is not a case of going into lodgings. It is a case, probably, of losing the greater part of his business. It is not a case of rent being raised, but a case of eviction, leases falling in, the premises being wanted for other purposes, and these people having nowhere to go. I applaud the Scottish caution of my hon. Friend (Mr. W. Graham) in putting down a new Clause. Perhaps we English people will do something similar, because, although we are more generous-minded and less suspicious, we have had our experience. In the hope that the right hon.

The object of this Amendment is to make provision for that class of tenant who have from time to time had increases of rent imposed upon them. It may not be generally known that throughout the British Isles there have been many thousands of cases where tenants, notwithstanding existing Acts, have had their rents increased. They have submitted to those increases very often through a species of fear and of alarm, lest in the near future the Kent Restrictions Acts would cease to exist and that then, if they had not paid the increases imposed by the owners, they would receive notice to quit. I had hoped that it would be plainly laid down that in respect of further increases of rent those already made would merge. According to this Section they have to submit to increases of rent already made, and then the amount of increase allowed in the Bill may be added. That is how I read it. The object of my Amendment is to put the date further back in order to give protection to people who have been paying increases for a considerable time, some of them for two or three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I gathered from the latter part of his remarks, my hon. Friend is under some misapprehension as to the present position, and the effect of the Bill. Under the series of Bills which have been introduced at different times, as the rental limit has been extended it has become applicable to the new classes of property as and from a particular day, more or less near the date of the passage of the amending Act, so that increases of rent which may have taken place in respect of premises now coming in for the first time were allowed up to a certain date. That is what we propose now in regard to the new sets of premises. We are bringing in premises in London up to £105. There was nothing to show either the tenant or the landlord that they would be doing anything wrong or anything outside the law in making any fresh arrangement as to rent before this Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
was introduced. Therefore, we must have a provision to protect these 
	<i>bona fide</i> arrangements. Some of them may be exorbitant; but we must have a provision to secure them in a reasonable manner. Therefore, we propose a date which is practically coterminous with the general promise of the introduction of this Bill and the report of Lord Salisbury's Committee. Where my hon. Friend has gone wrong is here. In the case of any of these premises now brought in for the first time, if the rent has previously been increased and then, hereafter, there is any suggestion further to increase it, it would come fully under the operations of this Bill and the rent then could only be in relation to the increase of rent as applied to 1914 generally in this Bill. If, notwithstanding the absence of legislation before March, 1920, a certain increase of rent had been agreed upon and nothing further happened in respect of those premises, that agreement would stand as it is, but if it were proposed to add further to the rent, then the rent which had to be paid would be covered entirely on the percentage relating to the net rent in 1914. If nothing happened, the agreement would stand in March, 1920. That is equitable. It is the procedure adopted by Parliament in regard to other legislation which has been passed. It is a fair principle. Otherwise in any alterations you would always have to go back to 1914. That would be most unfair all round, and that would be the effect of my hon. Friend's Amendment.

The chief object of this Amendment is to try to elicit some information from the Government with regard to this Subsection, because I am not at all clear in my own mind what it really refers to, whether it refers, for instance, to cottage property which has been reconstructed, or whether by any chance it refers to houses which have been turned into flats.

I want to know exactly what the Minister of Health has in his mind with regard to this Subsection.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this Amendment for several reasons. One is that in the borough in which I live there are a very great number of roads that are not made up. These roads cannot be made up by the authority until they are two-thirds built upon. At the present time they are all masses of dust, and in wet weather they are quagmires. It is extremely important that they should be made up, and that the landlord should be allowed to charge an expenditure upon them, because it is a great convenience to the tenants to have this road-making and paving done. It has always been recognised as an expenditure by the Revenue authorities, and it seems likely, if you leave it out, that these roads may be left over to get into a very much worse state. I know that it may be urged that it is not an opportune time to spend money on road-making, but in the interests of general public health it is an advantage that some money should be spent on road-making. If the roads be not made up, the authorities, certainly before three years are over, will have to ask for some additional powers so that they can make them up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes a good deal of difference. I take it now that they are intended to come in after the bracket. This Amendment raises the very difficult question as to how far we are to go. One could not pretend that a street improvement, if carried out, was in the nature of a repair to or an improvement of, the house itself, and I can imagine all kinds of difficulty and all sorts of complex questions arising as to where one began and the other ended. I think we should find ourselves in considerable difficulty. On the whole, we are dealing very generously in assisting repairs, considering the difficult conditions under which we are legislating. It must be remembered that this only applies to existing houses, where I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
suppose there is a street of some kind. In the case of new streets or anything built hereafter, of course this would be a part of the general expenditure on the scheme. Therefore, this Act only applies to a house now inhabited, and I take it there is access to it somehow or other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It seems to me going a long way. It is going an unjustifiable length. I cannot see that we would be warranted in accepting that proposal. Of course, it has to be remembered, if the houses were let years ago and there was a street which wanted doing up, that the cost of doing up the street was a factor in the rents which were charged for the houses. The tenants in those cases will have been paying their rents all this time without the improvement having been made. It would not be fair to those tenants for us to come along now and say, "Having waited all these years, you must now pay 8 per cent. on the improvement, towards which, presumably, you have been paying some contribution in your rent" I do not think that would be equitable. If it were a new thing, and the tenant wanted it, the cost of the street improvements, of course, would be a burden, because that increased and unexpected cost would not have been included in the rents charged; but I think it would be very difficult to disentangle the matter, and we are really providing for the 
	<i>bond fide</i> improvements of the houses themselves. We must remember that much street expenditure necessarily devolves on the local authority. The Amendment would create great difficulty, would give rise to much dissatisfaction, and would be exceedingly difficult to administer. Although I sympathise with the general purpose behind it with regard to unexpected increases in cost, I am quite sure that it would not be right or proper to embody it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very loath to withdraw it, because the expenditure to-day is vastly different from what it was pro-War, and it is therefore quite a fair charge to put upon the houses. It might be quite a different proposition if the authority could make the road up; but the authority cannot do so until it is two-thirds built upon. Many tenants in these districts would be only too delighted to have the roads made up and to pay this small sum of a few pounds in respect of the improvement. I suppose it would not amount probably to more than one or two pounds a year at the most. If the right hon.

The question raised in this Amendment is as between the payment of the allowance of eight per cent. on structural alterations for the higher rented properties now brought for the first time under these Acts, and the six per cent. existing under the old Acts. I am at a loss to understand why the figure "eight" appears in this paragraph. I was one of the members of the Rent Restrictions Committee, and I do not remember any witness appearing before that Committee asking for this eight per cent. If we were to allow it, it would be an inducement to owners of a certain class to spend money on structural alterations in order to obtain the eight per cent., rather than to spend the money upon new property. It would pay a very great deal better to put up a kitchen, or a scullery, or a billiard room at eight per cent. than a good deal of the building that we would like to see taking place. It would be unjust, and it is not called for. I know of no demand for it. It is altogether unnecessary. The six per cent. now existing in the Acts will suffice for all purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
is known to every member of the Committee, namely, the devaluation of money to-day, and the consequent increased rate of interest on capital. It ought also to be said—I think it is an object to which most members of this Committee will subscribe—that we should, if we can, get these repairs done, and that we should try to encourage the landlords to do them, not, of course, at the cost of an undue burden upon the tenant, but with an endeavour to strike a fair balance between the two. The last Act allowed six per cent. This Bill says eight per cent., but of course, the increase in the value of money in the interval has to be allowed for. That is the reason which has actuated the Government in bringing forward this proposal. I know my right hon. Friend the Minister is prepared to listen to the views of the Committee upon the matter, but that is simply the view that has actuated the Government in making the proposal contained in this paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman be prepared to listen to the views of the Committee, I should like very strongly to urge him to adhere to the actual proposals of the Bill. What has been said by my hon. Friend opposite is simply the common sense of a business proposition. The value of money has altered. To-day in the market you have to offer eight per cent. on prior securities. If you cannot borrow on a good debenture at less than seven or eight per cent., you cannot expect landlords to spend their money on repairs unless you offer something in the neighbourhood of the same rate of interest. I hope the Government will therefore adhere to the proposal in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something to be said on the other side. Do we want landlords to spend their money, not on repairs, but on structural alterations and improvements to existing houses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do you want them to expend it on repairs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of spending money on repairs. We should agree if it were. It is a question whether we want landlords in the present shortage to spend what material, labour, and money there are on making structural improvements to houses which are fit for
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
habitation, or whether we should use this limited amount of material, labour, and money in putting up new houses and increasing accommodation. We do not want to spend money on these alterations, but in providing additional accommodation, and, the object being to provide additional accommodation, we should limit this to 6 per cent. It is a sound policy not to spend money to-day on anything except the erection of additional and new houses. It is not a question of repairs, but of structural improvements to houses which are reasonably fit for habitation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People do not understand what this means. "Structural alteration" does not mean putting up a billiard room or any nonsense of that kind. Take the case of cottages of my own, small cottages in the country with inadequate bedroom accommodation. Before the War there were two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a little room besides. I added two rooms to each cottage, and made them healthy, good cottages in which to live. These were structural alterations. There are hundreds of other cases of slums, and so on, where the present accommodation could be easily altered and made suitable and decent, whereas in the present circumstances you are keeping the slums going because you are not encouraging people to improve their property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there not also cottages in the country that have fallen into a bad state of repair? Why have they fallen into this condition? Because there is not sufficient accommodation for the family. The cottage wants a scullery, better sanitary accommodation, and probably one more room. This is one of the best provisions in the Bill to enable you to get more accommodation. If anybody likes to take it on at 8 per cent. they might manage to do it, but they could not at 6 per cent., because they could not get the money with which to carry it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. GRAHAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is necessary to point out that the suggested increase in the rate of interest would be paid to men who are not necessarily builders at all, but who are moneylenders. Something has been said about cottages being improved by adding a scullery. It is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
common occurrence in some districts in the West of Scotland to add a scullery to a house a hundred years old. That is a structural alteration which entitles the landlord to increase his rent I have been told, and the people in the country have been told, that the landlords or owners of houses receive only something like 2 per cent., and in some cases 1 per cent., as a return on their money invested in the building of houses prior to the War. The 1915 Act gives them 6 per cent. for structural alterations, 4 per cent. more than they say they were in the habit of getting. You now propose to give 2 per cent. additional. I want to draw the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bill to the fact that the Salisbury Committee did not recommend that there should be any alteration in this particular Clause. I hope that the Government will take this matter back and reconsider it, because it is much easier and better from the point of view of many landlords to structurally alter dwellings than to build new houses, and it is new houses that are wanted. Most of the houses that may be structurally altered under this proposal are houses that ought to be destroyed absolutely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was anxious to hear what the Committee had to say on this question, because it is a difficult one. We are trying to steer a middle course. We want to see whether existing houses, as in the case quoted by the hon. Baronet opposite (Sir C. Warner), which are good enough and quite decent in themselves so far as the structure is concerned, can be made worthy houses by some improvement. We want to encourage that kind of improvement to be undertaken. The real object of the proposal is to try and make the best of existing accommodation, to improve a good deal of it, especially isolated cottages, and others which are capable of improvement. It is meant to be an inducement to improve houses. That is why it was put in. I see the danger pointed out by my hon. Friend who spoke last (Mr. W. Graham). I see that it might be worth a man's while to get 8 per cent. by some alteration or improvement instead of building a new house. We must secure ourselves against that danger, and, therefore, while keeping to the 8 per cent., I have looked with a friendly eye
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
on the next Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend opposite (Mr. G. Locker-Lampson) to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the tenant may apply to the county court for an order suspending such increase on the ground that such expenditure is or was unnecessary in whole or in part, and the court may make an order accordingly"</p></blockquote>
I am not quite sure that those are the best words, but two things might happen. It might either be an unnecessary improvement, so-called, yielding 8 per cent., or the landlord might spend an unnecessary amount of money on a necessary improvement and still get 8 per cent. Both these dangers might arise. I think, if 6 per cent. was a fair figure in 1915, as it was fixed then by Parliament, certainly you cannot say that less than 8 per cent. is the equivalent now, because money has gone up more than 2 per cent. I would like to keep the paragraph as it is, adding a safeguard providing against the dangers which the Committee have foreseen rather in the nature of the Amendment of my hon. Friend opposite, which would exclude unnecessary or fictitious expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel PINKHAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is usually the tenants themselves who urge that structural alterations should be carried out, and they are prepared to pay for them. In your housing schemes you are creating a privileged class; those who get the new houses will get them at half the economic rent. In the district that I represent the houses are supposed to cost £1,300, and they are being let at 17s. 6d. per week. The economic rent would be from 34s. to 35s. That is a privileged class, and its creation will cause irritation. The more of these old houses that you can alter and bring up to modern requirements with baths, better sanitary arrangements, and extra accommodation in the way of bedrooms, the better. The extra percentage is only a fair rise. The District Council to which I did belong had to borrow at 7 per cent. last week, and that is on the security of the rates. No man will lay out a lot of money at 8 per cent. when he must borrow it at 7 per cent. himself</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not some danger that the tenant may take advantage of this provision and allow the expenditure to be made and the improvements to be carried out, and then go to the Court and ask it to declare that the improvements had been unnecessary? Can the Minister in charge introduce some words before the Report stage to protect the landlord against vexatious application to the Court on those lines? If the tenant goes to the Court before the improvement is undertaken I should be entirely in favour of the Amendment. I only want to protect the landlord against a vexatious application to the Court after the improvement has been carried out,
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
whereupon the tenant turns round and says, "I did not want the improvement; therefore I shall not allow the 8 per cent" Will the right hon. Gentleman introduce some words to safeguard the landlord against that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think any such words are necessary.

The Court will consider the case on its merits. If the case were such that the tenant obviously consented to the work being done, I have no doubt the tenant's application would fail, and he would have to pay the costs of the application, which would be a sufficient prohibition of frivolous applications.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), to leave out paragraph (
	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this Amendment not because I am opposed to this paragraph 
	<i>in toto,</i> but merely for the purpose of finding out how this is going to apply to the case of Scotland. We are in very great difficulty in understanding many of the Sections in this Bill, because, apart from the reservations which are included in a later stage of the measure, there are some reservations which appear to us to be necessary in the case of Scotland which have not been included. This paragraph, as we understand it, proposes to transfer to the tenant by way of increase of rent such increases in the landlord's rates as have taken place since August, 1914. In Scotland we have a compounding system under the Scottish House Letting Act, 1911, up to a limit of £21. That provides for the payment of the tenant's rates by the landlord and there is the usual recovery in rent. What we fail to understand in the case of Scotland is that there should be transferred 
	<i>in toto</i> the whole of the rates of the landlord, and not merely that portion of the increased rating which applies to the tenant of the house. This is not made clear in the Clause, nor do we find any later reservation which appears to safeguard the interests of Scottish tenants. I understand that within the past two years an Act of Parliament has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
passed, which I regret I have not been able to trace, which puts Scotland substantially in the position of England in this respect, but I am told that this Act principally through war conditions has not been applied. If that be the position of affairs, we are entitled to be protected. There is no reservation from the point of view of Scottish conditions in a later section of the Bill which excludes Scotland or makes special provision for Scottish needs. We cannot let a Clause of this kind go without having a very definite explanation from the Minister on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not particularly familiar with Scottish law on this question. The Secretary for Scotland would have been here but he is at another meeting. If necessary, we will communicate with him. Perhaps my hon. Friend will be satisfied if I state that there is no new provision in this paragraph. It simply follows the wording of the previous Act. The principle has already been accepted by Parliament and appears in the same words on the Statute Book to-day. As I understand the proposition which my hon. Friend puts forward it is this, that in Scotland a certain amount of rates are levied on the landlord and a certain amount on the tenant, but under this Clause, as it is in the previous Act, any increase in rates levied upon the landlord can be passed on to the tenant. If there were no legislation the landlord would be able to increase his rent by the amount of the increase in the rates, and it is considered, in the principle which has been accepted by Parliament as regards England, and I should think it would apply equally to Scotland, that if these rates are so increased it is fair for them to be transferred to the tenant under the provisions of this Clause. The short answer is that the principle of this paragraph, in fact the exact words, have been already accepted by Parliament and, therefore, there is no new proposal concerning this particular matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member (Mr. W.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect, I do not think the landlord's increase in rates which is thrown on to the tenant has been in operation in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir A. YEO</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about Scotland. It has been so in England, and very much so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. Not in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, although it is the law of the land it has never been put into operation. This Bill is entirely different from the former Acts, because whereas under the former Acts the total increases, apart from rates, were limited to 10 per cent., the increases permissible under this Bill are something like 48 per cent. There is a possible increase of 25 per cent., a possible increase of 15 per cent., and a possible increase of 8 per cent. I do not say they would all be applicable at the same time, but they are possible increases, and very considerable increases compared with the 10 per cent. which was formerly allowed. As far as Scotland is concerned, it is a very vital question, because it has always been the custom in Scotland for a certain portion of the rates to be paid by the landlord, and for that reason the rents in Scotland have been proportionately higher. There fore, if you are going to give a proportionate increase on the existing rents you are compensating the Scottish landlord for the fact that part of the rates are payable by him. For that reason, I think it is a very serious mistake that this particular point in the Bill should be allowed to go through. It is true it was passed last time, but because it was passed in a previous Act it is not necessarily just or right. I do not think that the point was very seriously debated before in regard to the increase in the landlords' rates being thrown on the tenant in Scotland. I do not think it was realised by the Scottish Members at the time, but it has since been brought out. As a Glasgow Member I know that on the question of rates the feeling is very vital, and that something ought to be done to modify this particular Section so far as Scotland is concerned, otherwise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

the results will be far more serious than some people realise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will communicate with the Secretary for Scotland and undertake to see that on Clause 17, which applies the Bill to Scotland, any question which stands over from to-day shall be dealt with by him. The Scottish law of rating is something more recondite than I am competent to deal with. I understand that the underlying principle is the same. In Scotland the position is that a certain proportion of the rates are levied on the landlord and a certain portion on the tenant. In England the principle we adopt in this Bill is, that you take your rates as they were on a certain date and all increases of rates after that date can be charged to the tenant. That is the principle which it is proposed to apply in this Bill to England and in the same way to Scotland. There is no new proposal. In its application it would mean as it stands, that the increases of rates over and above the fixed amount from where you start, would be capable of being added to the rent. That is the case in England where rates are not split up; they are simply levied on the premises and paid by the occupier. So far as this particular paragraph is concerned, it merely reproduces the provision in the preceding Act. The hon. Member says it has not been acted upon in Scotland. As to that I make no comment. He says Scottish Members did not discover it before, which is a great compliment to the acumen of the hon. Member for Central Edinburgh (Mr. W. Graham) and himself. It is the first time I have ever heard of a Scotsman missing a money point. The Secretary for Scotland will attend later, and on the Clause affecting Scotland, if any new Amendment can be devised to meet any real point raised by my hon. Friend, my right hon. Friend will discuss it with them in the meantime, and it can be brought up on the Scottish Clause and agreed upon. We cannot amend this Clause now to meet the Scottish case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is no intention of his not being here until Clause 17. I have no doubt he will be here at the next meeting of the Committee.

Gentleman to say that the Scottish question would be left over until Clause 17. Anyone who listened to the Second Reading Debate must realise that in Glasgow this is a more burning question than in any other part of the United Kingdom. The case of Glasgow and the long-established custom in Scotland are very different from anything that exists in England, and the Committee will get into endless difficulty unless it faces the Scottish aspect of the case when it comes up under this Bill. I know that it is very hard for the Secretary for Scotland to be always present in this Committee, but if we could arrange for one of the Law Officers to be present when the Secretary for Scotland cannot, it would help and hasten the deliberations of this Committee. Little as I have examined the question, I realise that the Scottish case is substantially different from the English case and requires most careful consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
Government Act of 1898, except with regards to a very small amount, local rates are payable by the occupier. This Act applies only to dwelling houses which the landlord would be entitled to take up and re-let at any rent he likes. His right to do that is taken away under this Bill, and it is thought proper that if there be any increase of rates the tenant should undertake it. If the landlord were re-letting his house he would take care to let it at a rent which would pay the increased rates. In Scotland prior to this the landlord paid only part of the rates. Now when there is an increase in rates under this Section the landlord will be entitled to recoup himself with regard to that increase in rates, and in Ireland the increase of rates will be allowed to the landlord as an increase rent when you have taken away from him the power of re-letting the premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have submitted this matter to a considerable number of Scottish Members.

That is a thing which we cannot tolerate in a Bill of this kind. We realise that we are at a disadvantage in pleading for one section of the Kingdom and we propose therefore, with the concurrence of hon. Members who share my views, to frame a reservation for Clause 17. I hope that at the next meeting of the Committee we shall have one or other of the Scottish Law Officers. We have three Members of the Government and there is no representation so far. We cannot go on with this Bill unless the Scottish Office is represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

From our point of view this is a most important part of the problem. We suggest that this increase of 15 per cent. should be limited to 5 per cent., not because we do not feel that in the long run rentals will require to be put on something like an economic level in this country, but because we feel that at this stage a step so violent as is proposed by the Bill should not be taken. No one feels more strongly than I the difficulty under which many classes of landlords, especially small house proprietors, are carrying on at the moment. Very large numbers of them are getting little or no return on their property, but I suggest that there are other ways in which the position of that comparatively small, at all events, not unduly large, section can be met. On the other side, we are bound to have regard to the position from the point of view of the tenants. Very large numbers of tenants, especially in the crowded parts of the great cities, and even in country districts, are people living on fixed incomes. Also, thanks to the War, there is a very large section of tenants of this country existing on the allowance paid by the Ministry of Pensions, or other public authorities. For the time being, that great section of the community may be regarded as on fixed incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No hon. Member will dispute that if we have a 40 per cent. increase in rent, or whatever the actual increase is, and take into account also the inevitable rise in local assessments and the possible transfer of these assessments already foreshadowed in this Bill, the increase on great numbers of tenants is going to be very serious. It will fall very heavily, especially on the class with fixed incomes, and more particularly on the section of the community which suffered, perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
more than any other section the loss of breadwinners during the War. My feeling, and, I think, that of my Labour colleagues, is that whatever we may think of the ultimate economic level of rent in this country, we shall, in the long run, have to get, somehow or other, back to a sound economic system, but the right hon. Gentleman will not dispute that this is a Bill in which 75 per cent. of the reasons for it is expediency, and I think that we should make the transition as simple and easy as possible. We have attacked the increase at what we believe to be is the most vulnerable point. We agree, for the most part, from our point of view, that the repairs must be executed and some sort of allowance must be made, and in many cases I think that the allowance would require to be fair, and here and there even generous. This is a different section altogether. This is an increase in the rent of the property of 15 per cent., general purposes, which is to give them what it is thought they should obtain, having regard to the changed conditions in which we are living. If we are to effect a modification in this Bill at all, it is only here that this modification can be effected, and I make this proposal to reduce 15 to 5 in order to have this issue clearly and definitely raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone of us recognises the fairness with which my hon. Friend always presents a case to the Committee, but I am sorry that I cannot take the same views as he does. May I point out one circumstance which he did not recognise sufficiently. The persons who are receiving the pensions and allowances to which he referred, are relatively poor people, living in houses previously under the Acts. They are not those who would be liable, under the Clause as it stands, to the 15 per cent. They are practically all inhabiting houses which are previously under these statutes, and in their case the increase applicable is only 5 per cent. the first year. Therefore, the vast bulk of the people to whom we refer are ruled out at once. Hon. Members will understand how the 15 per cent. was arrived at if they look at the recommendations of the Salisbury Committee, paragraph 7, page 12. They will see that this increase, and the previous 10 per cent. which was allowed, were really based on the increased cost of money for mortgages, and for raising capital for housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
generally as mortgages fall in. This 5 per cent. represents one half per cent. increase on mortgages and the next 5 per cent. at the end of 12 months represents another half per cent., and if you look at the Clause of this Bill itself relating to mortgage interest, you will see that we only permit a total increase of 1 per cent. in the mortgage rate of interest, and that would be represented by the 10 per cent. There is nothing in that ingredient to allow a man any interest on the capital which he himself has put into the property, and that accounts for the remaining 5 per cent., making fifteen per cent. altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This 15 per cent., which contemplates a maximum increase of only 1 per cent. of the mortgage rate, is made up in this way. The Bill applies the 15 per cent. straightway to the houses brought under this Act for the first time, but in respect of houses already under these Acts it only applies 5 per cent. straightway, as previously 10 per cent. was added. Therefore it brings them all at the end of one year on to the same level. I do not think it would be possible to make a provision which on the whole would be fairer. It has been worked out with great accuracy, and it was dealt with carefully by Lord Salisbury's Committee. The increase in respect of dwellings previously included is 5 percent., not 15 per cent., and, seeing that it is difficult to get money raised for the purposes of building, we must frankly contemplate at least the rise of 1 per cent on ordinary mortgage rates, which this Act allows. We could not, in the interests of seeing that money is available for investment in building, do otherwise. If you do not do that, you stop building except by public authorities. We must secure that end, and it is in order to strengthen the security of this class of enterprise for the purpose of the common good that this increased 1 per cent. in mortgage rates is provided in this way in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has raised a frank issue. I do not think his 5 per cent. in regard to new properties will help us. It will discourage the investment of money in this class of property. He said, in parenthesis, that we must come sooner or later to some economic system. This is some small approach to it. We shall never do it unless we face the fact courageously. I take an opposite view
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
from that taken by him and his friends This Amendment is the first of a series—a carefully constructed series—the policy of which is to have successive rises this year, next year, and the year afterwards. It is part of a scheme of amendments my hon. Friend has put down. I prefer to face the question and have done with it. I think it better, in view of the difficulty of housing, to say, we will face this thing, in spite of its unpopularity, and that we will have a good lot of it fairly rapidly, instead of having it as a recurring sore for the next three years. I think it is better to do it as we suggest rather than in the piece-meal way he suggests. I differ from his view as to policy. It is better to do it courageously and face it, rather than to do it in bits and spread it over three years, which would not be of real help to the cause of housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot conceive the Mover of this Amendment dealing with it in the way that he suggests, because at the present time we have an increase of 10 per cent. on certain properties, and the other 5 per cent is to meet the mortgage interest. I have here a statement from Birmingham, in which it is pointed out that even these increases will not meet the difficulty:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Taking a house let at. 6s. 9d. a week before the War—this being in Birmingham a good type of artisan dwelling-house let at the then maximum rent within the compound limit—the net rent or gross estimated rental was £12 10s. and the amount allowed for repairs in arriving at the assessment was £2 10s. Accepting for the moment that the increased cost of repairs is as 2½ to 1—as suggested by the Lord Salisbury Committee upon whose report the proposed increases are founded"</p></blockquote>
That is below what it is costing to-day—
	<br><blockquote><p>"This would give us £3 15s. extra for repairs in the first year to which must be added sufficient to cover an extra ½ per cent. increase in mortgage interest (mortgage on this class freehold house £150) equals 15s. total, £4 10s. The 30 per cent. would give an increase of £3 15s. An increase of 36 per cent. is required to give a balance even accepting the increased cost given in the Report as sufficient, which is less than experience shows to be the fact. After a year the owner is entitled to charge another 10 per cent. or £1 5s., of which he has to pay his mortgagee another ½ per cent. His expenses then will be £4 10s., plus 15s., total £5 5s., and his authorised increase in rent £3 15s., plus £1 5s., total £5, leaving a deficiency and taking no account of any increased management expenses. On his own capital he obtains no increase, and his property returns
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
less than 1914 income, against 1920 cost of living"</p></blockquote>
I cannot help feeling that you have got to be just, if you are not generous. This Bill is by no means generous, and it is not even just, because you will get a less income from your property, even if you put on the whole 40 per cent. The people who sent me this statement, which is a fair one, tell me how it is made up. There is not the slightest doubt about it. Therefore, I think that to deal with it as the mover has suggested would be fatal to the Bill. You would get dissatisfaction all round, and you would not get that done which you want done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised by some of the statements of the Minister of Health. In the first place, he used, as an argument against this Amendment, the fact that it was intended to cover any increase in mortgage interest. If that be the object of the Sub-section, why is it not framed in that way, because property is not always mortgaged? In this Sub-section all property gets the same benefit, so that argument does not apply. In the second place, he said that, unless some adequate return was made in the shape of this increase, no new houses would be built. I would like to point out that this Bill does not refer to new houses at all. It does not refer to any houses built since the 2nd April, 1919, which is more than a year ago. People who are concerned in building should realise that the sooner houses are built the sooner these Acts will cease to be in operation, because it is the shortage of houses that makes the Acts necessary. He also stated that the class of property which was under the former Acts has already had 10 per cent. put on to it, and that he is only adding 5, so that at the end of the year all property will be under the same conditions. As far as Scotland is concerned, the 10 per cent. is not yet operative; and, therefore, he is wrong in saying that the 10 per cent. has been put on. What will happen? There will be not only 5 per cent. on that property, but a full 15 per cent increase in the course of 12 months' time. It is that sort of property which the hon. Member wants to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree that in cases of this kind it is better to put it on all at once. The right hon. Gentleman does not take into consideration the psychological effect of an increase of this kind in a country like
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
Scotland, where feeling on the matter is extremely strong. In Glasgow, if all these increases are put on, worse trouble will result. I feel that this particular Sub-section does not justify itself by being compensation for repairs or decorations done, like the other Subsections. This particular Sub-section should be framed so carefully that the increases would be gradual. If the Government, in another year or 18 months—the Act is in operation for three years—think that some further increase is justified, let them put on another 10 per cent. and bring in a Bill for that purpose rather than put on 15 per cent. on this class of property at once. I hope the Minister of Health will consider that point. I do not think he realises that the 10 per cent. is not in operation in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is mistaken. It is not a question of the 10 per cent. having been paid. The right hon. Gentleman never said anything of the kind. It has not been paid in England. What has been paid is the increase in consequence of the rates, which is quite a different thing. The 10 per cent. is not payable yet: there is no question about that. The reason this 15 per cent. will not come on to these people has nothing to do with that at all. They will not have it, because the houses to which this Section applies are houses that were not in the old Act, houses in which no working man lives, because they are over £70 a year.

increase of rent. We do not object to a reasonable charge being made by the landlords any more than by anybody else. You are paid £400 a year as Members of Parliament. You were paid that sum in 1914 and you are paid the same to-day. If you ask for an increase in your salary you will find that the men who object to it are the men for whom you are trying to get an increase of rent in this Bill. The Committee do not seem to realise the amount of feeling that there is in Scotland in regard to this proposed increase in rent. Personally, I am not in favour of even a 5 per cent. advance; but I am a believer in discipline, and I accept the decision of the party to which I belong. Our party is agreeable to Amendment on the lines of the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Central Edinburgh (Mr. W Graham), and it would be in the interests of the well-being of the country in the next few months if the right hon. Gentleman would agree to view this matter exactly in the way that it is viewed by my hon. Friend in his Amendment. We have no desire that difficulty should arise of another character, but I am bound to point out that an increase of 15 per cent. on rent immediately applied, and 25 per cent. for repairs means, and that is how the average man views it, an increase of 40 per cent. in the rent. We have never got any increase in wages corresponding to that increase in rent. No section of the working classes has got an increase in wages corresponding to this proposed increase in rent. What is going to happen? You are going to have every trade in this country putting in new claims for increase in wages, with consequent disturbances of trade and work that we had hoped we had passed through. I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to reconsider this question, and to consult with other Members of the Government as to the possibility of putting into operation the Amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Central Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that as a mere English Member I feel some hesitation in taking part in this Debate, for it seems to me that we are rapidly drifting into a position of discussing this Bill as if it were simply a Scottish Bill. I would remind the Committee that it is a Bill applying to the United Kingdom, or, at
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
any rate, to Great Britain, and I feel very strongly that the Amendment, which has been moved in very fair and reasonable terms, is an Amendment which goes to the very root of the whole policy of the Bill. We are discussing an Amendment which is vital to the structure of the Bill. I ask the Committee to remind themselves what is the policy that underlies the Bill. It is that we want to get back as quickly as we safely can on to an economic basis. You cannot consider this Bill apart from the general housing policy of the Government and the country at the time. This Bill is an essential part of a very much larger and very much wider policy, a policy which is concerned with re-housing a very considerable section of our people, and I make a very earnest appeal to the Committee to regard the Amendments that will be moved from time to time from that larger point of view, and not from the sectional point of view. That being so, what is the suggestion made by my hon. Friend? It is that in certain cases the increase should be limited or reduced from 15 per cent. to 5 per cent. The right hon. Gentleman was good enough to remind the Committee of the recommendations of the Salisbury Committee, and that one of the ingredients in this increase is an ultimate rise in mortgage interest, not an immediate rise, of one per cent.; an immediate rise of one-half per cent., to be followed six months later by a further rise of one-half per cent. In the majority of mortgages, what does that bring the percentage up to? I know of millions of money which have been raised on the classes of property to which this Bill refers, which are at an average rate of 4½ per cent. mortgage interest. When you have effected the change which is proposed in this Bill, that rate of mortgage interest will eventually be raised to 5½ per cent. I put it to any business men in this Committee, quite irrespective of their political preconceptions, whether they would ask any of their friends to advance money on mortgage on this class of property, or to continue their money on mortgage of this class of property, one day longer than they could help, at a rate of 5½ per cent. It is surely a simple question of the market value of money. It is not a question which we can really affect by legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The root question raised by this Amendment is this: Do you or do you
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
not wish to attract capital into one of the most vital industries of the whole country, namely, the housing industry? If you do wish to attract capital you must offer to that capital a fair rate of remuneration, and I contend that the provisions of this Bill go no further than they can fairly go in that direction. A good deal of criticism of the Bill has reached me, not only from Birmingham, but from all parts of the Kingdom, Manchester, the West Riding, and other industrial centres, and the opinion is that on the whole the provisions of this Bill do not go far enough. When I hear my hon. Friends from the other side of the Border suggesting that the Bill goes too far, I wish they would take counsel with some of those who have practical knowledge of housing conditions in the larger towns of England, and they would learn from them that the prevailing opinion is, on the whole, that the Bill does not go far enough. If there are hon. Members on the Committee who think it goes too far, and others who think it does not go far enough, perhaps we may assume that the Government have steered a reasonable middle course in framing the Bill. Therefore I sincerely trust that on this Amendment the Government will not show any signs of yielding to the pressure put upon them. The hon. Member for Central Edinburgh referred to the very hard case of those who have been deprived of their breadwinners by the trouble through which we have passed. May I remind him that there are two sides to that question? Many have been deprived by recent events of the breadwinners of the family, and they are to-day living solely on the rents which they derive from this class of property. I know of many such and for them the position is one of very real hardship, far greater hardship than applies to others who are living on wages for the rising of which they have an economic remedy in their hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. HALLAS</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish the right hon. Gentleman would make a very clear statement in order to satisfy the bewilderment of a great many people as to whether the 10 per cent. in the Act of April, 1919, which this Bill is to repeal can possibly apply. As I understand it, the 10 per cent. set forth in the 1919 Act does not come into operation until six months after the official end of the War. We have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
reached the official end of the War, and in the meantime that Act is to be repealed. Therefore, it seems to me exceedingly strange that from time to time references should be made to a 10 per cent. that does not, and cannot, exist. If I understand the position—and like other hon. Members I have got correspondence from all over the country, asking what this means—under this Bill there can be 5 per cent. increase in rent during the first twelve months of the operation of the Bill. It can be followed by a 25 per cent. increase in the second twelve months, making 30 per cent. in all. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] It is all very well for hon. Members to say "No," but I have been trying to get at it. The Minister in charge told us on Second Reading that on houses coming under the 1919 Act, there was to be a total increase of 30 per cent., but that on the higher rented houses now brought in for the first time there was to be a total increase of 40 per cent. The prevailing opinion throughout England is that there is to be a 40 per cent. increase on the lower rented property, and the strongest agitation has been set up against it. If it is to' be only 30 per cent. we may have our troubles eased to that extent by having that statement made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to statements coming from Birmingham and other towns. I have received a letter to-day from the secretary of a federation of tenants' associations in Birmingham, representing something like 50,000 members, in which he says that at a public meeting of tenants in a schoolroom in Birmingham a resolution protesting against 40 per cent. increase has been carried unanimously, and the meeting solemnly pledged themselves to pay no rent if the 40 per cent. becomes law. Similarly, in another part of the town, at a meeting attended by 2,000 people, the same pledge was given. Chester-le-Street, Walsall, Cardiff and other places have sent along similar pledges. On one day alone 28 pledges of organisations in the Midlands, numbering over 70,000 members, whole-heartedly supported the rent strike if the 40 per cent. is imposed. There is no use them talking about a strike against a 40 per cent. increase if it is not intended. We should be told clearly what is the intention with regard to this, whether it is to be 5 per cent., to be followed by 20, or 5 per cent. followed by 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members are getting up imagining that the 5 per cent. is to be put on to the 10 per cent., and the Minister assures them that the 10 per cent. does not stand, and that this Bill. does away with the former Bill. If that be so, every Member of the Committee wants to help the Minister in passing the Bill, but let us know where we are. Does it do away with the 10 per cent? If the Bill becomes law are we entitled to put on 5 per cent this year and 25 per cent. next year? Let the public know where we really are, and say it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite so easy to put things in that simple way. I wish it were. It would be much easier for Ministers, Parliamentary draftsmen, and the general public. This Bill consolidates, and, except so far as the provisions apply, repeals existing Acts. So far as the 10 per cent. referred to is concerned, the Act of 1919 allowed an increase of 10 per cent. on the premises then brought in for the first time. It allowed an increase of 10 per cent. on premises previously under those Acts, six months after the War. With respect to those houses that time has not yet arrived. This Bill consolidates all those Acts, and it only allows 5 per cent. during the first year in respect of premises that were previously under these Acts. It allows 15 per cent. in respect of premises that are brought in for the first time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>was partly in respect of mortgage interest and partly in respect of repairs. That is wiped out, and this is the provision now. We deal separately with the repairs point, and we have deliberately dealt with it separately, but so far as the previous 10 per cent. is concerned, you can get that out of your mind. It is off the slate altogether. The 25 per cent. which is proposed to be added in respect of repairs will be added to whatever we provide here. It will be 25 per cent. added to the 5 per cent. in respect of the premises previously brought in, and it will be 25 per cent. added to the 15 per cent. in respect of the premises brought in for the first time. That will be dealt with separately when we come to argue about repairs. I hope that we may now get the Bill to the end of paragraph (
	<i>c</i>).</p>
