	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, if the Committee so wishes, we shall debate at the same time the other order before us namely, the National Health Service (District Health Authorities) (No. 4) Order 1992 (S.I. 1992, No. 2752).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I make my contribution, on behalf of my hon. Friends I wish you, Sir James, the staff of the Committee, the civil servants and even Conservative Members a 1993 that you and they will remember with joy. This gives me the chance to renew my acquaintance with the hon. Member for Harrogate (Mr. Banks), with whom I spent some delightful weeks this summer in Australia on parliamentary business. I hope that he enjoys the next 90 minutes as much as we enjoyed those few weeks together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall set the Minister five tests on the orders as they are controversial and objections from across the political spectrum in Yorkshire have been raised to them. All seven district councils—of which only York is controlled by Labour; the rest are controlled, one way or another, by the Conservatives—community health councils and community groups have expressed serious doubts, reservations or outright opposition to the Government's proposals. They are anxious about how the Government are stealthily reorganising district and regional health authority boundaries without coherent discussions on the consequences for the numbers of health authorities that will be left, for the value of the reorganisation, for the delivery of local services, or for the involvement of local communities in the development and output of those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must fulfil five tasks to make clear why the orders were introduced. Can he produce evidence of increased efficiency and of what that will mean for the volume of contracts that the new authority will issue to its provider units? If the Government maintain that the changes will improve dramatically the efficiency of delivery of services, the Minister should be able to show the Committee what that will mean in practice for north Yorkshire. In the establishment of the new amalgamated super district,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Department officials responsible for the initial discussions made clear that they could prove to the local community the improvement that would result in the delivery of services. What are the Government's priorities in judging the performance of the new health authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What steps is the Minister taking to increase local involvement? He may be able to argue that an amalgamation is necessary because of the constraints of the market and of the need to ensure that there is an organisation large enough to negotiate properly the number, value and quality of contracts. However, he must also give a firm commitment that he has not moved away from the position in the White Paper which referred to devolving decision making to a local basis for delivery of service and for involving the locality in the creation of local services for local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister doing about development of decision making? How will that affect the quality of local community involvement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is most important. In much of the evidence that I have seen from community groups about this proposal, the objections relate to the Government's failure to maintain that commitment of local accountability and local involvement of community health councils. Later, I shall give evidence of the large curtailment of local involvement in the decision-making processes under this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal brings us back to the 1960s and the early 1980s when there were giant bureaucracies in the national health service under Governments of whatever political complexion. Area health authorities were abandoned with general political support on both sides of the House. It was recognised that those area health authorities were remote and out of touch with local opinion. They did not involve the local communities in the delivery or planning of services. In the 1970s a reorganisation took place under the then Heath Government and it was a disaster. In the 1980s, after consultation and a national agreement, this Government took steps to get rid of area health authorities and to introduce more locally accountable health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now going back on that decision. What has happened in north Yorkshire is probably the best example of what went wrong in the 1960s, 1970s and the early 1980s. In north Yorkshire, district health authorities failed to deliver either the level of service or local community involvement as needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal mirrors the arrangements that were discredited at that time. This is not a new revolutionary approach to delivery of health care in north Yorkshire. The proposal would take north Yorkshire back to the time of those discredited arrangements in the 1970s and 1980s. The Government must provide evidence for why that should be so. Why should the district health authorities be persuaded that those past experiences will not be revisited?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I understand the pressures on Government and those on district health authorities to amalgamate as they lose their operational responsibilities which are divided between the purchaser and provider. In many areas nothing more than a rump is left. In that rump, little or nothing will be done about the planning of services. Only a few people will be left to deal with contractual obligations. However, that is not the case in respect of the size of the districts in north Yorkshire. There is no evidence of a lack of viability in the current arrangements. That is clear from the consultations that have taken place. I have seen no evidence presented to the Government from across the spectrum of those involved in health care—family health services authorities, district health authorities, local authorities, social services, general practitioners whether fund-holders or not—for the patchwork of boundary reorganisation that is proposed for north Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is incumbent on the Minister to say what evidence has been submitted to him. What overwhelming evidence has he had from the local community that suggests the need for these changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the truth is that in north Yorkshire, as in the north west, East Anglia, the south-west, Trent and the northern region, the Government have been forced, because of the market mechanism, to make horrid changes in respect of health authorities and to create new, super arrangements. They hope that, by introducing such measures, the large institutions and organisations can cope better with the market and the internal negotiations that take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has nothing to do with patients' involvement or local community involvement in the delivery of services. It is a million miles from the commitments given in the White Paper about the need to maintain local accountability. "Working for Patients" states that it was to be devolutionary, not revolutionary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a revolutionary change is taking place in region after region with no real public debate, no national strategy from the Government about the result and no word from the NHS management executive about the intended result of the reforms as regards numbers, size, or the setting of priorities in decision-making about NHS service delivery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for north Yorkshire are unacceptable and not simply because of the local community's gut reaction. There are sound economic reasons for not proceeding with the proposals. There are also sound management reasons and sound reasons related to the delivery of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Early in the discussions about the proposal a statement was issued and carried in the 
	<i>Health Service Journal</i> of 18 April 1991. It was made by the then project leader, Roger Brown, who was, I assume, either an official of a regional health authority or of the Department of Health official. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main aim of the project was to consult with local people. GPs. voluntary groups, the family health service authorities, to pin down gaps in services and to develop ideas for improvements."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Whether or not one agrees with changes in the health service, on the face of it, that was an excellent approach to the development of services in the long term and the involvement of those who are delivering services or who are involved in the promotion and creation of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened since that commitment was given in that press statement from the Department? Consultation has been, to say the least, brief. The views of those who have been consulted have been virtually ignored. If the view expressed by the civil servant in the press release is to be taken at face value, the response to the proposal was overwhelmingly hostile in relation to the geographical nature of the changes, accountability at local level, central administration, cost-effectiveness, purchasing arrangements and their effect on local purchasing and local participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give the Committee a flavour of the objections that have been placed before the Minister, and which one must assume, given the decisions that have been made about the statutory instrument, he either ignored completely or overruled because of some other overwhelming evidence that has not yet reached the public domain although we hope that it will reach it this morning. On geographical boundaries, for example, Airedale, Harrogate and Richmondshire stated that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Geographical distance makes practical unity impossible" in terms of affinity, natural links, response to need, use of service and building up new links to improve services. That is quite a damning indictment from those local authorities, which are all Conservative-controlled.</p></blockquote>
On accountability there are four major objections, from local authorities, community health councils, community groups and GPs. For example, Harrogate and Richmond said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"How is this reform in keeping with the main purpose of health service reforms, to develop decision-making and responsibility to local people?—purchasing effectively is being removed from local involvement and local control.</p></blockquote>
That is completely against the commitment given by the Department in the White Paper.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Proposals for 'local involvement' are not met by establishing local offices of employees—it does not meet the need for the Chair and Authority having close links with local people and organisations."</p></blockquote>
That was the view of Richmondshire district council while Airedale community health council and Ryedale district council, which is not labour controlled, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Uniformity and cost-effectiveness are principal themes of the Consultative Document, not patient views. Inadequate account of how these will influence decision-making."</p></blockquote>
Harrogate said that a result of the proposals would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"Inadequate account of health education, infection control etc at present done locally".</p></blockquote>
That is another damning indictment by an organisation responsible for the co-ordination of such activities. The position is the same regarding the proposed centralisation of administrative decisions.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Northallerton district community health council said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A GP with a list of 7.000 is considered to be a viable purchasing unit: therefore what is the need for a larger body in North Yorks?".</p></blockquote>
That is to say, if it is viable for a general practitioner to have the right to purchase health care in the market, why is there a need for such huge amalgamations which will take away from districts the right to be involved in purchasing health care in their community? That makes no sense—there is no logic in the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Richmondshire district council said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The assumption that this county-wide authority would emerge regardless has resulted in DHA staffs being run down through the "option" of joining Trusts or for the North Yorks Health Project, therefore appearing inadequate".</p></blockquote>
That is an accusation that the Government are deliberately undermining the morale of those working in the health service in this area by giving the impression that the amalgamations are necessary and inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most damning objections to the proposals have come from those in community groups, community health councils and local authorities attached to community health councils. There is to be a proposal to reduce dramatically the number of persons involved in community health councils across north Yorkshire. My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) and other Opposition Members will be giving details of the numbers involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have indicated that there will be local committees to consider arrangements and encourage contact with the local community. Those committees will have no statutory rights—like the community health councils. There is nothing to say how they will be funded—like the CHCs. The proposals are totally inadequate: they will mean the loss of local statutory rights to be involved in the development of services and to consider how they are delivered and managed, the loss of access to the complaints procedure through the community health councils and the loss of access to public involvement through the community health councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of local knowledge will be lost from those who are involved in community health councils, the overwhelming majority of whom I imagine are involved not because of party political considerations, but because they are connected with local community groups helping people with health problems. Their experience and knowledge of the health service is being cast aside because of bureaucratic changes. The health service will lose experienced people who are committed to it and who work regularly and free of charge in the interests of patients and potential patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Government to say that, whatever else they will do, they will seriously reconsider the position and ensure that when the proposed changes
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
have been introduced, there will be a review. The Government should make a commitment to allow community health councils, as they currently exist, to continue having the same statutory rights and funding. Most importantly, local communities and the health service should be able to continue to draw on the experience and knowledge of that core of people involved in community health councils in north Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very least, the Minister should give us that commitment, which would signal to those in north Yorkshire that the Government are still interested in what local people have to say about the delivery and management of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Tom Sackville)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir James, may I first echo the wishes of the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) in wishing you a Happy New Year, and also thank the hon. Gentleman for his own kind wishes which I hope will be repeated often from the Dispatch Box?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the orders, we must remember that the background is one of a health service which has been entirely changed by the reforms. After reading the press this morning, I think that it is true to say that the shadow Secretary of State for Health advised the Labour party to begin to accept the reforms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the benefit of attending the press conference. The health spokesman said no such thing. He said that we would reintegrate the trusts and that GP fundholding practices had no place in Labour's health policy. The Minister would have been wise to attend the press conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not entirely the main emphasis given in some newpapers. Either way, I fear that what was said displayed an unwillingness to accept or understand the nature of the reforms which separate the purchaser and provider. That means that the health authorities' role is entirely different from what it was a few years ago. They are not service providers or hospital managers. They now purchase health care so the analogy of health authorities as they were some years ago is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, as health authorities have a new, reduced role and do not employ a large number of people to manage hospitals, there is obvious common sense in examining whether it is practical to continue to have nearly 200 health authorities. Yorkshire, as would be expected, has been ahead of the game and it has taken the reforms upward in exemplary fashion, showing the rest of Great Britain the way and how the reforms should work. A considerable reduction in the number of health authorities is likely. Including the amalgamations contained in the orders, I expect a fall from 170 to around half that number although I cannot be sure because decisions, based on all sorts of criteria, will be taken locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I was asked to justify the principle behind the amalgamation of health authorities. First, most health authorities are too small to be viable and do not have sufficient flexibility and purchasing power. Therefore, it makes sense to amalgamate to ensure that they can deal better with and take an overview of an area's health needs. There are a number of special considerations relevant to the two amalgamations that we are discussing and I shall deal with them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of joint boundaries with other agencies, particularly with family health services authorities and with the social services—in effect, the local authorities—is also important. They will increasingly have to work together over joint purchasing and community care. The amalgamations which the orders will bring about will make the health authorities coterminous with the FHSAs and with local social services. That is satisfactory. There will be economies of scale which will allow savings to be made on administration. There is little point in duplicating roles in several health authorities when they could be better fulfilled by one. I expect considerable administrative savings over time, particularly in north Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would welcome the Minister giving figures for the savings that will be made. What is he comparing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is he comparing the costs before the introduction of a purchaser-provider split with the costs now, or is he comparing the costs of a purchaser-provider split district health authority as it was before 30 November with the costs now? May we have the figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point. I am comparing an amalgamated health authority with what would remain if health authorities were separate purchasers with their own boards, which is what the hon. Member for Makerfield recommended. In north Yorkshire, I expect several hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of administrative savings over time. I cannot be more precise than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the changed role of health authorities, it is plain common sense not to retain the present structure, but there is every point in taking advantage of coterminosity and the joint working that can take place with local family health services authorities and local social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, north Yorkshire has gone ahead with the reforms before many other areas. I have total confidence in the decisions that have been taken by local management and I refute the allegation that there has been blanket opposition to the changes. In north Yorkshire, representations were approximately 2:1 in favour of the changes. They were more markedly in favour in Bradford. Taking both areas, only one hon. Member made a formal representation—and that was the hon. Member for York who was against the changes. I refute the allegation that there has been overall local opposition.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should start with an apology, Sir James. The last time that we met was in Belgrade and, as a new hon. Member, I did not know that you were "Sir" James. Therefore, when I wrote to you asking you to pass on a note, I addressed you incorrectly and I apologise for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision that has been taken is bad. It has been incompetently handled by the Government in a cavalier fashion. They have overriden the majority of local opinion in north Yorkshire. The regional health authority met on 4 June to consider the results of its consultation exercise and took a decision, wrongly in my view, to recommend to the Secretary of State that the north Yorkshire health authority merger should go ahead. Nothing happened until the beginning of November. On 10 November, the Secretary of State laid an order before Parliament to create the new health authority on 1 December thereby depriving Parliament of the opportunity to debate the change, should it have chosen to do so, before the merger went ahead. That way of dealing with the matter disregarded Parliament's right to examine such statutory instruments in a way that would enable it to influence the decision should it be so minded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I oppose the merger in north Yorkshire for three principal reasons: because of the size of the county; because it will create a multi-tiered bureaucracy and because it flies in the face of public opinion. One of the cornerstones of the "Working for Patients" White Paper—the precursor of the health reforms that the Minister has described—was to take decisions closer to patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North Yorkshire is Britain's biggest county. It is bigger than either Devon or Norfolk. It is 110 miles from Filey on the North sea to Ingleton in the dales, and the county stretches to fewer than 10 miles from the Irish sea. It is more than 90 miles from Selby in the south of the county to Whitby in the north. From east to west, the county is longer than the distances from the London borough of Barnet to Nottingham, from Ealing to Bristol and from Brent to Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county is vast. From north to south, the county is longer than the distances from Hounslow to Bournemouth, from Watford to Leicester and from London to Calais. Hon. Members from the south may not know as intimately as they should the geography of north Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North Yorkshire is a vast area. The idea that one health authority will be in touch with local health needs and local opinion beggars belief. That view was reflected in the consultation with and each and every one of the local authorities in the county. They said, "No, this is too big. Think again". Their views have been overruled by the regional health authority and ignored by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
North Yorkshire is a diverse county. It encompasses the urban problems of York, sheep farmers in the dales, fishermen on the east coast and miners in Selby. It is not uniform and it is not made up of areas with similar health needs. It is necessary to understand local environment, social and demographic factors as they are important for health needs. The merger will fail to retain close links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional health authority recognises that that is a major problem so it has created a complicated three-tier structure. At the centre is the north Yorkshire health authority. On the second tier five local offices will be created, each with its own management team replicating the management team at the centre. Each local office will have a consultant in public health medicine who will replicate the work of the district director of public health. Each centre will have a finance chief, an administrative chief and so on. Below the second tier, there will be 25 localities, the largest of which will be in York, covering a population of 100,000, and the smallest in Bedale, covering a population of 10,000. There will be 25 different units around the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it better to have a multi-tiered structure with bits of paper being shuffled from one tier to another? Will that lead to better decision making than under local health authorities? The new structure has doubled the number of management teams between the local offices and the centre. Local officers already exist so why do we not leave management with the local office management teams, which are responsible to local health authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The savings you spoke of are minor. You say that they will be made over a few years and that you expect savings of several hundreds of thousands of pounds. The budget for the new health authority is approximately £200,000 a year. Correct me if I am wrong. You are talking of a saving of 0.1 per cent., if you are right, although I do not believe that you are because you have calculated the savings by removing the costs of the members of health authorities from the figures and have not included the costs of the two tiers of officers. Consultants in public health medicine do not come cheap. By the time they are provided with back-up, you are talking of £100,000 for each post. How many will you have in the new health authority—10, 12 or 14?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Sir James. When I said "You", I meant that it is the Minister who is proposing to spend big money on the new structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The planned change flies in the face of public opinion. No doubt people were prompted by the Government to make favourable comments, but if one considers public opinion in the county, the only local elected representative bodies are local
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
authorities. What did they say about the proposal? In a consultation document sent to the regional health authority, Labour-controlled said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"York City Council strongly opposes the proposals to create a county wide health authority … for reasons of quality of service, accountability, accessibility and timing."</p></blockquote>
The Minister may say, "Well, they would, wouldn't they, as a Labour authority."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal-led Harrogate district council stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are major disadvantages in the proposals relating to the removal of decision making from the local level."</p></blockquote>
As a Liberal-led authority, they would say that, would they not? As my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield said, it was not just Labour or Liberal local politicians in north Yorkshire who came out against the proposals, but politicians of all parties. Conservative-led Selby district council's response states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fundamental concern which arises from the proposals in the consultation document is that they appear to cut straight across one of the main purposes of the health service reforms, which was to devolve decision making and responsibility to local people."</p></blockquote>
Commenting on central authority's multi-tiered structure—local offices and local teams—Selby district council states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst it is, of course, essential that local offices of employees be retained, this is no substitute for a local Chairman and Health Authority members who, living and working in the local community and having full contact with local people and statutory and voluntary organisations, are best placed to be knowledgeable at first hand about local health needs and the ways in which these should be met."</p></blockquote>
Selby was not alone. Hambleton district council, which has an overwhelming Conservative majority and is as true blue as the Minister could ask, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed Parliamentary Order referred to in the consultation document should be opposed for two primary reasons as follows:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) There is no satisfactory means of securing real involvement of local people, which demands a DHA structure with a Chairman and Directors, with first hand knowledge of local health needs and service requirements, at local level based upon each of the main population centres in the County, and for which a locality team of officers is not an acceptable substitute … (b) The size and structure of the new DHA proposed is hopelessly inadequate to the crucial local assessment and monitoring requirements of the DHA function".</p></blockquote>
Opposition to the proposals come from across the political spectrum—Conservatives, Liberals, Labour supporters, independents and Greens are against them. I think that there are one or two Green councillors in Harrogate. There is a fear that local health needs will not be dealt with properly by the highly centralised structure proposed by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an alternative which I ask the Minister to consider. He mentioned that I commented on the regional health authority's consultation document. I wrote to the regional health authority and stated:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not share your view that big is beautiful and I hope the RHA will abandon its plan, but if you feel you must consider creating larger authorities I would urge you to consult again on a wider range of options including (a) a three authority proposal: for, say, York, and Harrogate/Airedale, and Northallerton/Scarborough: and (b) a two authority proposal: say. York/Scarborough, and Harrogate/Airedale/Northallerton. I do not personally support such plans, but I think they would be better than going for a single North Yorkshire authority".</p></blockquote>
I did not receive a response to the letter. I am not alone in suggesting an alternative of not so big and slightly more beautiful. The Conservative-controlled north Yorkshire branch of the Association of District Councils referred to what has happened in other parts of the country. It reports:
	<br><blockquote><p>In Devon, it had been proposed to merge four DHAs to create one countrywide authority. On consultation, this proposal has been overwhelmingly opposed. Three of the four DHAs have now formed a Management Consortium and Joint Purchasing Body whilst retaining autonomous status as statutory DHAs. The remaining DHA continues to stand alone as such.</p></blockquote>
Why, in Devon, which is a smaller county, do the South Western regional health authority and the Secretary of State accept local opinion and retain four district health authorities because of the county's size and diverse needs, whereas in north Yorkshire the Government, against the local authorities' will ram four and a half health authorities together into one enormous body?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave four reasons for supporting the proposal. First, he said that most health authorities under the new regime would be too small. Too small for what? Too small to listen to public opinion? I think that that is a benefit. Secondly, he said that there would be advantages in having joint boundaries with the FHSA and social services. However, a local government commission is currently examining boundaries. It is probable that in England's biggest county, the responsibility of social services will become that of smaller unitary authorities. It is wrong for the Secretary of State to assume that there will be no change to the social services, boundaries. If coterminosity were a primary aim, why did not the Minister, who said nothing from June to November, wait a month or two longer for the recommendations of the local government commission?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Minister said that savings would be made because of economies of scale as the new health authority could buy in bulk. That is not good health care, but the old-style, one-size-fits-all approach to public service of buying in bulk and handing out an option on a take-it-or-leave-it basis to the local population. Smaller health authorities mean more flexibility, smaller purchasing units and a greater ability to match health provision to the requirements and choices of patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I ask the Minister to return to savings. The savings that he described are small—perhaps one tenth of 1 per cent. of overall spending. He still has not justified or explained from where these savings will come and whether he has netted them off against the increased costs of this multi-tiered bureaucracy. I should like him to deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for York who was on Radio York with me this morning at about 7 am when, having been woken from a deep sleep, I was asked to give my views on the strike against Iraqi bases. I am glad to say that there were no problems between us on that. However, I am not in such agreement with what he has just said. It is also a pleasure to serve on the Committee with the hon. Member for Maker-field with whom I spent many hours on a parliamentary visit to Australia. We went through jungle, parliamentary buildings and desert and had many interesting experiences, not least visiting a nuclear testing station where we both probably got a bit of radiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted, also, to have the opportunity to discuss the orders. The name chosen, the north Yorkshire health authority, is very similar to the old district authority names and does not explain the body's purpose, which is to commission health care. Some people say that it is to purchase health care, but that has an aura of goods being purchased, whereas in this case, services for patient care are commissioned. It is probably too late to change the name, but a change would be welcome to clarify the exact nature of the new north Yorkshire health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Harrogate have seen a considerable improvement in services as a result of the national health service reforms. The Harrogate health care trust—the national health service trust—will have treated over 1,000 more patients by the end of March. There have been internal savings of £250,000 as a result of improvements, and between April and October last year, surgical treatment episodes increased by 19 per cent. Those are encouraging figures, and there are more to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent an additional £70,000 on drugs, an additional £300,000 of new money on medical equipment and £4 million on improved technology and new buildings. That augurs well for the Harrogate health care trust. We wish it well in what it is doing to improve patient care, get value for money and make the reforms work, backed by the enthusiasm of our general practitioners, consultants and all staff working in the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yorkshire as a whole has treated about 2.25 million out-patient appointments and there have been 700,000 consultant episodes in a single year. Those figures are rising. North Yorkshire in particular has an enviable record in health care. I see no justification for any criticism of past performance and there is certainly much praise for present performance. The reforms are sharpening quality and improving the speed of patient care. We are seeing a dramatic improvement in the quality of information provided in the health service and to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reforms have had the important result of breaking through artificial barriers. General practitioners have the option of sending their patients to be treated at a variety of hospitals which in the past
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
they could not have considered. Distances are measured more in terms of travelling time than mileage because of our improved roads and general communications. We must dispense with the old concept that one must have one's treatment in the local hospital down the road or in the nearest town. What is important is for people to have the best hospital treatment available as quickly as possible. That means, quite naturally, going further afield for treatment. Many people are perfectly able and willing to do that and are pleased to have their health care needs dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The north Yorkshire health authority concept was the subject of wide consultation, especially with local Members of Parliament. I had a meeting with Sir Bryan Askew, chairman of the Yorkshire regional health authority, right at the start of the concept's development. I know that he and his officers consulted widely with Departments of State and with local people. The public consultation exercise followed on from those early meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield made much of what he called the loss of local involvement. In my case, local involvement is through the Harrogate health care trust—that provides the opportunity for direct involvement. We are talking here about the commissioning body that purchases health care. The north Yorkshire health authority, whose headquarters are in York, already has five outlying regional offices dotted around different parts of the county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he has just said? Does he support closing his local community health council and removing the involvment of local people?

Gentleman has a local community health council. Is he telling me that he supports its closure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that we need to ring the changes. The new body will be able to purchase hospital care. It will have to take account of all the local needs, fed to it through the Harrogate health care trust—That body has the viability and machinery for ensuring that people get the right care—but it must be purchased through the North Yorkshire health authority. That is a reasonable and sensible approach. People have the machinery for consultation through their local contact with the health care trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One criticism relates to the size of the authority. It is important to have the right technology to deal with the situation and to do so cost effectively. Size is important to justify the technical equipment that is necessary to know what operations can be conducted in which hospital and when, and how long the waiting lists are in others. I am convinced that a commissioning authority of this size is the right size. It has a ring of good sense about it. As my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the Minister said, there is common sense in the proposal. It is the right size for conducting the operations that it must carry out. It will be cost effective in being able to acquire the technology. It is perhaps rather like purchasing an air ticket for a journey, when a person can switch from one airline to another, change his seat in the aircraft, and so on; it is all done at the flick of a switch. We require such equipment and technology for the commissioning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we shall see greater improvements through this arrangement. I am convinced that, through all the consultations that have taken place, the best way forward is to approve the proposals, which are already in place, and to get on with the task of ensuring that everything works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Despite that, I hope that I shall be forgiven for my intervention. Incidentally, my first job and first flat were in York, so I can claim some local knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be very much subject to changing fashions over several decades in ideas about the most appropriate size of local government or health service units. To some extent, it is a pity that such changes in fashions in local government and health do not always coincide. Judgments are made about appropriateness in governance of health and, some years later, other judgments are made about appropriateness of local government structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, things change, and the arguments are often finely balanced. We may move from a view that big is best to the contrary view that small is beautiful. Plainly, in complex matters such as local government and health, we need to achieve the right balance. Often, that may point to different forms of authority, although some now argue for unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether there is one answer. However, I believe that this proposal for a bigger solution in north Yorkshire is the wrong solution at the wrong time. I recognise that there may be arguments on both sides, but it seems that, with the growth of trusts, we are to some extent saying that trusts have to pay attention to different criteria—essentially, the criteria to produce a financial service. They operate in a market; it is the purchaser-provider idea. Foremost in the mind of a trust will probably not be the needs of the local community. Indeed, trusts may want to provide services to communities that are far away from Yorkshire. That is now part of the ethos—for good or ill—of the market solution. Therefore, there is a separation of links between the provision of much future health care and the immediate community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is true, we need mechanisms and aspects of government related to health to be firmly rooted in the local community. I understand the Minister's argument that the new market and purchaser-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
provider regime mean that we now need a larger unit of government in north Yorkshire, which could of course set precedents for elsewhere in the country. I would put the contrary argument: we now need health authorities that are firmly rooted in quite small communities if we are to make community planning effective in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the four community health councils are to be preserved—though it would be useful if the Minister could say more about their future role. I am pleased about their retention. I know their importance, as a former member of Croydon's health council, one of the foremost in the land—the council, not my membership. [Hon. Members: "Hear Hear."] The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) readily agrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the future in north Yorkshire, although the four community health councils will be preserved, they must now relate to just one authority. The link between the community health councils and the health authority is in that sense broken. Given that health authorities occasionally do not treat community health councils with the respect that they deserve, that divide-and-rule approach may be a problem in the future when four councils, which after all have few resources and staff, have to contend with the large bureaucracy of the north Yorkshire health authority. I would like the Minister to say more about the role of community health councils and how they are to grapple with the big monster that he has created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join my hon. Friend the Member for York in asking about coterminosity,—a terrible word, but good in one sense—that it must be right, when reforming local or health service government, to try wherever possible to match up the boundaries. One of the curses of modern government in Britain is the range of different boundaries, when links between areas of public policy can increasingly be seen. In the light of what I hope will be our future efforts to turn community neglect into community care, coterminosity becomes a vital argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister thinks that the force is with him, because at the moment his proposal would provide coterminosity between the new health authority and social services. I see that point, but my hon. Friend the Member for York has asked the important question—how long that will remain true? What about the local government boundary commission? What about the proposals to create unitary authorities? I would not imagine, from my knowledge of north Yorkshire's geography, that the local government commission would make a unitary authority of north Yorkshire as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that a unitary authority would be much smaller. I wonder whether the Minister has launched his bureaucratic boat too quickly in this instance. I repeat the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for York. Why did not the Minister wait a while? In a year or two we may
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
have quite different local government, and structures will be out of kilter once again. Very important questions are raised by this. The Minister used the idea of coterminosity to support the proposal. I wonder if that is wrong, and if coterminosity is a substantial argument against the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Sykes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been rather nice to see that some things do not change. Labour Members have managed once again to detach themselves as far from the facts as possible. Why, for example, having been in favour of the Inner London education authority, the Greater London council and other county structures, do they not favour the proposed arrangements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple fact is that, when funding is tight and every £1 coin has to count, the last thing Yorkshire needs is five different management set-ups, with all their associated bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In north Yorkshire, or as I prefer to call it the north riding, a group of men and women have got together and, under the new arrangements, will ensure that more money will go towards caring for patients as it should have done initially. The essence of the management structure is to promote health gain and to ensure that money goes to making people healthier and to prevent illness. The aim is not to swell the ranks of pen-pushing bureaucrats who whizz around the county in expensive cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those in charge have taken a lot of trouble to listen to the objections that have been raised and they have shaped the management structure accordingly. For example, five highly qualified people from each area will serve on the management body. They include Dr. Renshaw, a highly qualified dentist in Scarborough who is held in the highest esteem by the people of that town. Their function is to ensure that all the money is fairly distributed to the areas involved. There will be five offices. The main one will be in York, but there will also be offices in Harrogate, Northallerton, Airedale and in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of people in Scarborough and Whitby support the reforms which will clearly benefit health care in Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment briefly on the issues raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield made a number of points and, no doubt, he will make a few more. He asked how we would judge the effectiveness of the new arrangements. The answer is simple. The regional health authority will call the districts to account under the patient's charter and other performance targets. Ministers will hold regions to account for their performance. On past evidence, we shall have little complaint with north Yorkshire's performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Eventually, the test will be whether services to the patient improve or not. Services to patients are improving fast. If one considers providers all over the country, one will see that performances are improving. The changes will further assist that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been made of local opposition to the changes. I shall be more specific and point out that all existing health authorities in north Yorkshire supported the amalgamation. Most of the trusts and neighbouring health authorities supported the change as did the FHSAs and local medical committees. In Bradford, existing health authorities expressed their support. Local trusts and the Bradford community health council stated their support, which is significant and welcome, as did representatives of GPs and Bradford university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has already been stated that community health councils will remain, including the one that covers the old Airedale health authority. That CHC has been strengthened by an extra grant to allow it to take on extra personnel because of local worries and the fact that Airedale will be split between two larger health authorities. It was thought appropriate to help the CHC to better represent local opinion. I make it categorically clear that there are no plans to abolish or merge CHCs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of a cavalier attitude, the consultation and the laying of the orders were carried out properly and by the book. There are no grounds for complaint. We are debating the matter as is proper. I reject the suggestion that the changes have been made in a cavalier fashion. The regional chairman did his best to discuss the matter with all Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York said that the new structure will be out of touch with local opinion. I ask him not to decry the establishment of five local offices in Northallerton, Harrogate, Skipton, Scarborough and York. They will be staffed by people whose primary aim is to represent local health needs. They will probably have much more contact with local people than the old health authority by dint of their not being service providers. Their raison d'âtre is to purchase care for local people and to take into account local views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the details, but appointments are considered carefully so that they are representative of local opinion.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refute the suggestion that there will be extra and unnecessary duplication of posts in local offices. The local health consultants and others employed in those
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
offices will be useful in assessing the exact health needs of the local population. They will not cost more money. It is wrong to suggest that there is a further local bureaucracy of three tiers. The 25 localities are planning areas, not extras tiers of bureaucracy. It is important for me to set the hon. Gentleman right on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comparisons were made with Devon. As a feature of the reforms, we have encouraged regions to take local decisions on how to structure purchasing. There may be many local reasons for taking a different view in Devon, but I have every confidence that the structure proposed for north Yorkshire and Bradford will be responsive to local opinion and able to assess health needs properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the remarks of the hon. Member for Harrogate on the significant success of the NHS in Yorkshire. Performance figures suggest that things are getting better and better and I have every reason to believe that the new arrangements will assist that further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks) asked how the CHCs should grapple with the new monster, it is not my job to tell CHCs how to grapple with anyone; they seem to do that effectively all over the country. I am certain that, as they remain in post, they will have no difficulty in identifying and making public defects in local health provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility of boundary changes, but coterminosity should be measured between local health authorities and FHSA's. The position may or may not change if there is a change to local authority boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I welcome what my hon. Friend for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) said about local health provision. I echo his remarks that this is all about patient care. I am certain that the new arrangement will mean significant savings and that purchasing will be carried out more efficiently, to the benefit of patient care. I have heard nothing this morning to make me doubt that north Yorkshire and Bradford will have the correct structures to better improve patient care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that consultation outside and inside the House would be by the book and above board. The House—the mother of Parliaments—has some strange quirks. To suggest that it is fair, above board and going by the book to debate whether the proposals are adequate and right when the new authority has been operating since 1 December negates parliamentary scrutiny. The Secretary of State chose to lay an order before the House and left us less than three weeks to consider it. He then used the Whips' facilities to ensure that a Committee did not debate the order until six weeks after the authority was set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

House and could have nominated a Supply day for debating the merging of health authorities. We have heard little from them on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I gave way to the Minister after hearing such a stupid answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments to the NHS's structure have been put forward by the Government. I demand that they give Government time for a debate on the Floor of the House about where the Government are taking us. The north Yorkshire amalgamation is only one in a long list of amalgamations, force amalgamations and shot-gun marriages. There will be more, as the Minister said, which will bring the number of health authorities running purchasing consortiums throughout the United Kingdom and planning the developments of services in the community to as few as 85. That was never stated explicitly or implicitly in White Papers or any other Government document about the dramatic reform and restructuring of the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been politically dishonest in the way that they have carried out this reform and fundamentally wrong in their approach. If the Government want to reorganise the NHS service delivery boundaries fundamentally, they should be honest enough to bring proposals to Parliament and set them out for public debate and scrutiny. We would then understand where the Government are heading, why they chose their route and where we will be after the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are allowing the market to determine the structure and nature of the organisations which will deliver NHS services and provide the management structure for those services. That is incompatible with the proposals in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for York and for Croydon, North-West set out in devastating fashion the failure of the Government and the Department of Health to take into account north Yorkshire's localities, the nature of the communities and the effect of the proposals. The hon. Member for Harrogate—the James Bond of the Conservative party who always shoots from the hip with a smile—set out unequivocally why he wholeheartedly supports the Government. I am sure that his constituents will welcome that. If they do not have basic local facilities in their district, they may have to be bussed, shipped or flown elsewhere in the United Kingdom or abroad for basic services which should be provided locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first time that I have been in Committee with the hon. Member of Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) and I look forward to participating in debates with him in future. He was not long at the crease, had a few pats around with the bat and walked before any difficulties arose. In his interests and those of his constituency, he should monitor what happens as a result of the amalgamation from an early stage. His
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
area is on the periphery of the proposed new organisation and it is likely to be affected by the cost-effective measures which have been announced by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that, when I questioned the Minister about increased efficiency and the use of resources, he could not provide the Committee with details of the nature of such an increase. The Minister said that there had been the most detailed consideration of the proposals because, following consultation and local debate, he and his Department suggested that there was overwhelming evidence that the reforms would mean improvements in service. However, he could give not one example of those improvements, the time scale for implementation, the cost savings that would be made or what that money would be spent on. He could say only that it would be several hundreds of thousands of pounds over a period of time and, in a throwaway line, said that major reforms will be made in the health service in north Yorkshire. It is not good enough for the Minister to be so cavalier when it comes to determining major health service reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a one-off case. Coterminosity is an issue about which the Minister and I must exercise our minds in respect of our own areas. In a matter of weeks, the Minister will make a decision about the enforced amalgamation of his health authority and mine. My health authority is coterminous, so it has to be destroyed and amalgamated with that of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My health authority is opposed to that move, as are the family health services authority and the local authority. The trust is opposed to it, but the Minister will nevertheless amalgamate our health authorities because of a political decision to try and manage the market in the best possible way with regard to the changes. That is evidence in the corporatism of making huge changes in the size of the purchasing organisations. Local accountability, local purchasing of health care and the involvement of the local community will go out of the window.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not convinced us. I am afraid that we will be back debating similar orders on numerous occasions. Massive changes in the delivery of health care in the United Kingdom will take place on the basis of market decisions. There will be no logical preparation for the Government's proposed changes regarding the operation and responsibilities of district health authorities. This is a bad day for north Yorkshire and a bad day for the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
