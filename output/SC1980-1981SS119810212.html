	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. May I thank you for your intervention in ensuring that the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of Tuesday's Committee proceedings is available to us. Copies for both the morning and afternoon were available early in the day yesterday, and it was very convenient to be able to read them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon Gentleman discovered that the report was available at an early time yesterday afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a separate point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The Committee will be all too well aware of the very unfortunate events in the industrial scene in the West of Scotland, with the closure of the Talbot plant. I recognise that it is something of a rumour only, but I understand that it is likely that there will be a debate on this matter in the House on Tuesday afternoon. I accept that no decision about this can be taken until a Business statement has been made, but if that supposition is correct could we not suspend Tuesday afternoon's sitting? I am sure that I speak for hon Members on both sides of the Committee, particularly the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), who will want to be in their places for that debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I had not heard of this possibility, although of course I appreciate that if there were to be such a debate hon Members on both sides of the Committee would be anxious to take part. The best thing I can suggest at this stage is that perhaps after this morning's sitting, when we may have a clearer view as to what the business is likely to be on Tuesday, it may be possible to reach an accommodation. I fully appreciate the hon Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>METHOD OF FIXING AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF HOUSING SUPPORT GRANTS </div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. Ill, in page 8, line 39, leave out paragraph (
	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now plunging into quite a short clause, a technically interesting but not necessarily in itself highly controversial clause, which deals with the housing support grant. However, the most innocent of apparently technical changes can have behind the mask quite far-reaching effects, and I make no bones about the fact
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
that I am not entirely clear about all the implications of the clause. The amendment gives an opportunity for the Minister to explain rather more fully how these changes will operate before we come to the clause stand part debate, which it may shorten as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To understand the point of the amendment, which deals with the new section 1(4A) that the Bill inserts in the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1978, one has to have at least a rough idea of how the housing support grant is calculated. I am sure that I shall be on common ground with the Minister in saying that I understand that at its simplest level it is a subtraction sum. What happens is that one takes the aggregate of eligible expenditures of housing authorities in Scotland and subtracts from that the aggregate relevant income of the, I think, 56 housing authorities in the nation. Once the aggregate is arrived at, the difference between the expenditure and income figure is the housing support grant. Then, obviously, for each individual authority a further individual sum is done on exactly the same basis to get the apportionment of the total which has been arrived at from the aggregate calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is simple and straightforward simplification of a very complicated process, in which there are many anxious—indeed, I sometimes think tortured—debates about the various factors taken into account and the various weightings to be ascribed to those factors. The eligible expenditure is basically loan charges plus management and maintenance charges, with some weightings for high-rise dwellings and sparse population. The relevant income is the assumed rent income, the implications of which we shall come to in the debate on the clause stand part, and the rate fund contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new subsection (4A) on the face of it is a perfectly sensible suggestion, because, as I understand it, the present law is that one has to aggregate in the first stage of the calculation all the eligible expenditure and relevant income of every one of the housing authorities in Scotland—the 53 district authorities and the three all-purpose authorities that make up the total. Subsection (4A) says that the Secretary of State at his discretion may omit from that aggregate calculation any local authority figures if he estimates that in the case of an individual authority the amount of the relevant income is likely to exceed the amount of the eligible expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if there is a surplus—or a notional surplus, because these are often notional figures—what subsection (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) says is that then it is not necessary to aggregate those figures in the Scottish total. Whether that is so we shall come to in the debate on clause stand part, but on the face of it that is actually an advantage to the remaining local authorities, which I hasten to concede to the Under-Secretary. Clearly, if there is an inverse balance on an individual local authority and it is included in the calculation, it will close the gap between expenditure and income and one would imagine would normally reduce the amount of housing support giant that is available
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is not clear, and why the amendment has been tabled, is the significance of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"he determines, under section 2 of this Act, that no proportion of the aggregate amount of the housing support grants is to be apportioned to that authority".</p></blockquote>
That is presumably if the Secretary of State comes to the conclusion that he does not need to make an apportion-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
ment at the second stage of the calculation, using the new powers which I think are included in clause 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little puzzled as to why we need paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) in these circumstances. I would have expected to find that the Government were introducing the simple provisions that where there was a surplus—that is, where income exceeded expenditure—there would be no apportionment in the second stage when the cake was being divided among individual authorities. But the inclusion of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) seems to presuppose a situation in which there is a non-apportionment and no slice of the cake for an authority, but it is not an authority which is in surplus. If that were the only situation in which there could be no apportionment, we could remain with paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) and would not need paragraph (
	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existence of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) is clearly on the supposition that there will be circumstances in which the new powers included in clause 19, which will amend section 2 of the 1978 Act, will be operated, but they will be operated in the case of an authority where the income does not exceed the expenditure. I am genuinely unaware of what the circumstances might be. The Under-Secretary owes us an explanation, because if there are no such circumstances we do not need paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), and the amendment is well-founded. If we do need paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) to take account of circumstances that are not covered by paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), I know of nowhere where we can get an explanation of exactly what those circumstances are. The Minister can do something to further my education in quite an important matter of legislative innovation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important and complicated matter. I shall confine my remarks specifically to the amendment. The hon Gentleman has asked a reasonable question, to which I shall try to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, including paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), is a matter on which there has been full consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which understands the reasons for it and has not raised any objections to it. I think that the hon Gentleman will understand why when I explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon Gentleman has correctly pointed out, paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) envisages the possibility of a situation in which, although the expenditure of an authority might be greater than its relevant income, it might not be entitled to any housing support grant. This is a possibility under the existing system, not because of any whim or discretion of the Secretary of State, but because of the distribution formula that applies for housing support grant. Although successive Governments have tried to get the distribution formula as near 100 per cent, reliable as possible, that has never been entirely possible, for technical reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why it is possible for an authority not to receive housing support grant although its estimated expenditure may be marginally or significantly greater than its relevant income. The first is what is known as the distribution factor, which has meant that, over recent years, the percentage of grant which a local authority has received has been equivalent to 85 per cent, of its assessed need. This has been meant to be an incentive to authorities with particular problems to keep down their costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
We proposed to the convention this year that that distribution percentage should be abolished because the advantages which it was supposed to provide are of great doubt in any event. We felt that the time had come when it could be phased out, and this would have helped to deal with the particular problem which the hon Gentleman has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention was at first sympathetic to that idea, but subsequently raised the point that it feared that an immediate abolition of this distribution percentage could create transitional difficulties for a small number of authorities which might be significantly affected by the consequential loss of income. We accepted the convention's advice and agreed with it that for next year the distribution percentage, instead of being 85 per cent., should be 90 per cent., and for the following year 95 per cent., and then gradually be phased out altogether. So, within a very short time, one factor which can lead to a local authority with expenditure greater than its relevant income not having housing support grant will disappear. It would have disappeared this year if the convention had agreed, but, for problems of transition, the convention was unhappy about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was aware of the negotiations for the phasing from 85 per cent, to 100 per cent, on loan charges. I think that there was some argument about that, an argument about similar machinery. The Under-Secretary immediately lays himself open to the question whether, if the 85 per cent, is phased up to 95 per cent, over the next two years and if this clause does not come into effect until 1982-83—which I think is the intent of clause 20—it is really necessary, for what looks to me like just one year, to have this paragraph written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman would be correct, if that were the only relevant factor. I said that there were two reasons. This is the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason concerns something which will be, as far as we can tell, with us for the foreseeable future. Housing support grant aggregate is determined by a projection of the probable grant year loan outturn, while distribution is based on the near actual grant year minus one relationship. That does not tell the hon Gentleman very much. May I explain what it means. When we are dealing with the aggregate of expenditure of a local authority, what we take into account are its actual loan charges for the year in question. But for distribution purposes it has been traditional to look at what is called "grant year minus one"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Minus two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It used to be minus two but, as a result of the recommendation of the convention, we have changed it for the forthcoming year to grant year minus one. But that in itself is still a figure different from the actual loan charges which a local authority will incur in the year in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a purely technical matter. Indeed, we should be only too happy if we or the convention could come up with a more satisfactory method which removed this technical possibility. The fact is that, with the agreement of the convention, we use grant year minus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
one for distribution purposes in assessing the cost of loan charges, because that is a figure which can be significantly different from the actual loan charges for the year in question. That is why it is perfectly possible for the estimated expenditure of a local authority to be greater than its relevant income. It is for this reason that paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) is also necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of no local authorities that will come into this category in the coming year. But it could certainly happen next year or the year afterwards. Therefore, it is clearly appropriate that the position of these authorities should be excluded in determining the aggregate of housing support grant. If a local authority for any reason will not receive any housing support grant, it is clearly anomalous that its expenditure and income should be put into the aggregate amount for determining the overall level of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make it abundantly clear that one of the concerns expressed in certain quarters about this provision is totally incorrect. It was suggested by some —I think that Shelter was one such organisation— that this provision enabled the Secretary of State to penalise an individual authority by deciding to ignore its problems when considering housing support grant. That is simply not possible. All that the Secretary of State can take into account when determining relevant income is the total contribution. The proportion of either rent or rates by which that contribution is made up is irrelevant. Therefore, there is no way in which he could use the provision to penalise a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a purely technical matter, and that is no doubt why the convention has not expressed any opposition to the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very complicated matter. The Minister has probably strayed on to paragraph (
	<i>c</i>). Even after reading the notes on clauses which the Minister has provided, I am still confused in trying to find where we are, let alone understand what it is about. No doubt that is a weakness on my part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any fear that an authority being in surplus would be reluctant to undertake a housing programme simply because it would then go back into debt? I do not know the mechanics, but I am a little fearful about this, as the housing programme has totally collapsed in Scotland. It constantly amazes me that some authorities that we think have big housing problems are just about to go into surplus. The distribution formula means that those authorities that do not need it will not get any help. Provided that that is the intention, would it then be a disincentive to such authorities to engage in normal building programmes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point does not arise on the amendment. We are dealing not with an authority in surplus but with an authority in deficit that is still not entitled to HSG because of the way in which the convention has agreed that the distribution formula applies. This provision in no way affects the question whether an individual authority receives housing support grant. All that it is concerned with is the effect that the position of an individual authority has on the aggregate of housing support grant for Scotland as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
whole. It is simply intended to provide that where an authority, because of the distribution formula or because it is in surplus, would not be getting housing support grant whatever happened, its income and expenditure should not be put into the general pool in determining aggregate income and expenditure, and therefore aggregate housing support grant for Scotland as a whole. There is no disincentive arising out of this provision to any plans of an individual authority. Its "personal" entitlement to housing support grant is not affected by one penny as a result of anything in this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case does it mean that it is favourable or unfavourable to the total amount of housing support grant that would be attracted under the existing calculation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) would be favourable. The provision of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), if there were any examples in the current year, would be equivalently unfavourable, but the overall effect is pretty neutral. It depends entirely on the number of authorities. What it ensures with regard to all the authorities in a given year that are receiving housing support grant, is that it is only their income and expenditure which is taken into account in determining what the aggregate housing support grant should be. That clearly makes common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the Minister. He has usefully added a good deal to my knowledge of the technicalities of this part of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) was perhaps straying on to clause 19, where there will be a minor diminution presumably in the rights of local authorities to get an individual apportionment, because they can be excluded from it. But the Minister will no doubt explain that it is authorities like Nithsdale, which I think got the princely sum of £100 out of the Government housing support grant, that are at risk. No doubt it will be suggested that this is no more than a tidying-up mechanism. But that is sufficient answer until we reach clause 19, and I do not want to follow the Minister in straying on to that at this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's first explanation for paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), as he hastened to agree, is in itself not very substantial, given the timings. I think that I made a slip in my intervention, because I was suggesting that there had been two arguments about phasing, but of course there was only one argument about that, and the 85 per cent, to 100 per cent, argument was in fact about whether the full amount of debt charges should be taken account of in the distribution formula. As the Minister will remember, authorities such as Glasgow were very disappointed that he did not go to 100 per cent, in one leap. I think that the phasing has cost Glasgow about £1 million in the current housing support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One should emphasise that the argument, if there was one, was within COSLA. The Government were happy to accept the view of COSLA on this matter. But the hon Gentleman is correct; there was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
difference of view, because it affected different authorities in the way that he has indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I accept that entirely. Clearly, authorities with large debt charges were in favour of their being taken into account in their entirety. Hence Glasgow and Motherwell—and Monklands, 1 suspect, though I have not looked at the Monklands figures— were in favour of that, while a number of other authorities were a good deal happier about the phasing arrangements. But in any event those phasings hardly amount to an argument for subsection (4A) (
	<i>b</i>) because, with the provision not coming into account until 1982-83 that would be a poor base on which to include this in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I take the point that the Minister has made about his second reason, it is a highly technical reason and it seems to me of marginal practical importance, but we are dealing with matters on the margin here. 1 hasten to say, given the knowledge of my own competence in the matter, that nothing would persuade me to go into the arguments about G-l and G-2, which are expressions that crop up fairly frequently in memoranda sent to me by more learned people. I accept that there is a possibility, because of this argument about current debt charges, that in basing one's calculations on the year previously one finds that distortion will have been minimised by the move from G-2 to G-l, because one is getting nearer the current situation. I can understand that there is the possibility of a gap between the current reality and the historical perspective on which the calculations are based, which might produce the kind of distortion to which the Minister has referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon Gentleman is correct in saying that, because it is nearer, it might be more accurate, but he has to balance against that the fact that the G-2 approach was based on actual outturn and therefore the figures were definite. The G-l is estimated expenditure and loan charges. That is why we were originally reluctant to move to G-l, because it was a more arbitrary assessment, but the convention was firmly of the view that this would be desirable from its point of view, and we responded to its request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a reasonable selection of Ministers we have! My heart is touched to hear that the Under-Secretary fought long, stoutly and hard against accepting an arbitrary power to decide on mythical, estimated figures. I congratulate him on his stand of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not very happy about paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), because, as the hon Gentleman says, to some extent it offsets the possible advantages of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) from the point of view of the local authority aggregate total. However, I accept that the technical reasons he has given are justifiable, and I shall not push this any further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause in many ways, because it gives us an opportunity of looking at a number of interesting innovations, on some of which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
did not put down amendments because I felt that at the end of the day I was not in a position to attack them. However, we certainly need information from the Minister about their impact and effect. I am sure that the Minister will forgive me if I hop about a little round the clause and raise a number of different points, some of which he will anticipate being raised because they have cropped up as queries from interested parties. I suspect that those interested parties have also given the Minister the benefit of their memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the purposes of clause 18 of which I thoroughly approve, because it clears up an ambiguity, is the one covered in subsection (2). It is an interesting example of a retrospective provision. When the Minister replies I should merely like confirmation that what we are doing there is ensuring that the housing support grant should not be taken into account in the calculation of relevant income. The 1978 Act has been nestling coyly on the statute book for a long time with that possible ambiguity in it. Presumably the key subsection is subsection (1) (
	<i>a</i>) (ii). It is unfortunate that the matter has gone so long undetected, because subsection 18 (2) has a remarkably retrospective air to it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 1978 Act shall be deemed for all purposes to have had effect as if originally enacted as amended by subsection (1)(
	<i>a</i>)(ii)."</p></blockquote>
There cannot be anything more completely retrospective than that, but I accept that it was presumably a drafting oversight. Successive Ministers have been happily proceeding on the parliamentary intention, although apparently the drafting of the statute did not enshrine that intention, and we are now putting it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 20 clause 18 will not be implemented until 1982-83. That seems to me to be entirely sensible, because it allows us to have a breathing space to digest and absorb the technical changes involved. Then we start off at the beginning of a new financial year operating the new system. That seems to be a perfectly correct approach, which I wish had rubbed off on some of the other clauses in the Bill. I refer particularly to clause 13 and 14. I turn to the more controversial and important parts of clause 18. It is clear that the housing support grant is based on eligible expenditure less relevant income. I do not want to deal with the aggregate stage—we discussed that under amendment No. Ill—but what I am interested in is the impact at the stage at which the cake is being cut into slices for the individual local authorities, when they discover exactly what part of the housing support grant they are to receive.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past it was perfectly clear that there were 56 authorities concerned, the 53 district authorities and the three, I was going to say, "odd bods", but that would be an unduly pejorative way of referring to the all-purpose authorities. We ought to have some indication from the Minister as to how many of these authorities are to be left out of the aggregate calculation under current circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, with the HSG for 1981-82, the provisions included in paragraphs (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) and (4A) (
	<i>b</i>) had been in operation, and the subsequent right to exclude from the apportionment, I presume that Nithsdale, with, as I said earlier, the nominal sum of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
£100, would have been excluded. But there are a number of other authorities which might have come into that category—for example, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, with £32,000, or Eastwood, with £15,000, which are very small figures given the totality of the rate support grant, which runs to over £140 million. It probably is reasonable to ask the Minister, if he had had those powers, how many local authorities would have been knocked out of the aggregate calculation because they fell under the paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>), or because at a later stage they would not have been included in the individual apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me not entirely unreasonable that a local authority should be excluded from the aggregate calculation if its income exceeds its expenditure. On the face of it that is a perfectly sane proposition and not one which anyone would wish to get over-excited about. But we can sometimes look behind the language and inquire into exactly what the effect will be. It is important to do so in this case, because—as you will appreciate, Mr. Gourlay, from your own knowledge and experience of local government—we are dealing here with a very artificial series of concepts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we get into the housing support grant calculation we plunge into a world of symbols, conventions and private codes which have been evolved, not designed according to one rational system, but evolved over a period of time, by the fertile, subtle, but sometimes almost medievally theological minds of Scottish Development Department officials. I do not think that anyone would actually have sat down and invented the housing support grant. I often think that in the days of the counter-Reformation we could have spent many happy months at some diet, perhaps not at Worms but at some medieval equivalent, evolving this particularly obscure sign language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is well made in the housing support grant, order. When we talk about eligible expenditure, the innocent person might well imagine that this was a real or actual figure, but it is described in paragraph 4 of the order as
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State's estimate of authorities' reasonable eligible expenditure".</p></blockquote>
So we are looking at a prospective figure, not an outturn figure. I think that that is inevitable; I make no complaint about it. It merely underlines that it is arbitrary. This dreadful term crops up again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion the Secretary of State or his henchmen have not been prepared to eschew the burden of making these arbitrary assessments. Not only is it the Secretary of State's estimate, but it is his estimate of what is reasonable, because it is the "reasonable eligible expenditure" and not the eligible expenditure, for example, which is put up to him by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to speak at all about the expenditure side; that in itself underlines the unreal world which we are now entering. What I want to say is very relevant to the clause. I want to ask some questions about relevant income. When I have been asked what is the relevant income of a local authority, or the aggregate relevant income of local authorities, for housing support grant purposes, I have always said in shorthand terms, without perhaps thinking exactly what is implied, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
it is the assumed rent income and the rate fund contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the significance of paragraph (
	<i>c</i>)? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in subsection (7), in the definition of ' relevant income', for the words ' and any rate fund contribution' there shall be substituted the words ' payments, contributions (including any rate fund contribution) and receipts '."</p></blockquote>
It will no longer be necessary or possible, if I am being accurate and using words precisely as they should be used, to say that "relevant income" includes rate fund contribution and assumed rent income. I really ought to expand that "rate fund contribution" into "payments, contributions (including RFC) and receipts".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first simple question, which the Under-Secretary will no doubt have little difficulty in answering, is what are the contributions which include the rate fund contribution, but which obviously must include other things, or we could have left it at " rate fund contribution". Also, and perhaps more important, what are the receipts which the Minister has now included in his definition in subsection (7)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of some interest to us because there have been suggestions, which may well be unfounded, that this is something to do with the Tenants' Rights, Etc (Scotland) Act. My definition of " reasonable " is not perhaps that which more conscientious people might put upon the word, but, as any reasonably conscientious person would, I went to the notes on clauses to discover exactly what all this meant. They were remarkably unhelpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may put the hon Gentleman out of his agony at this stage. The question of the receipts from the sale of council houses may often be relevant for questions of capital expenditure, because they can help reduce the loan charges of a local authority, but they are not part of its income for housing support grant purposes. The housing support grant is concerned with revenue, not with capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That helps me to some extent, although the Minister will not choke off the subject quite as quickly or as easily as that. I take the point that the sale of council houses largely affects the capital side, but a point has been put to us by Shelter, among others, about deposit payments, and the edge which in opening years mortgage income as against rent income might give to the assumed rent income of a local authority. If one assumes that the rent income of a local authority is included in the relevant income for HSG purposes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rikind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The payments that a person who has purchased his council house might make to pay off his mortgage from the local authority would be payments that were not to housing revenue account. They have no relevance to the housing revenue account, which is the one that is relevant for purposes of housing support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder about that, because we cannot have our cake and eat it, although perhaps in some cases we try. Is the Minister arguing that there will be a conversion, perhaps halfway through a year from a rent income on a property to a mortgage income? I was trying to argue that the mortgage would provide a higher income than the rent, at least initially, although
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
the hon Gentleman's policy is perhaps closing that gap rapidly. That is something that we worry about greatly in terms of distortion in the arguments on the sale of council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume for a moment that the hon Gentleman is right and that conversion from rent to mortgage halfway through a year does not go into the housing revenue account and is not available for HSG. Presumably, when the assumed rent income for the year is calculated, on the basis of which the HSG calculations are made, the fact that that house has been sold will mean that there will inevitably be a reduction in the actual rent income against the assumed rent income, because a mortgage has now been substituted for the rent which the hon Member assumed would be paid when he did his HSG calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that, to that extent, inevitably there would be an awkward situation in which there was another shortfall between the assumed rent income and the actual rent income which would be found during the course of the year. If the Under-Secretary is saying that the conversion from rent to mortgage is irrelevant, because it will not increase the income for housing support grant purposes, he must surely agree that it will have some impact, that it will actually decrease, because that rent will be lost. The question then arises whether this will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is perhaps not riveted by the argument, but I think that it would want to know what compensation there will be or what will happen as a result of that distortion. It is an extremely important general point which we can raise with advantage at this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that there are widespread council house sales. I hope that in my constituency and in the city of Glasgow generally, and, indeed, elsewhere in Scotland, that will not happen, for reasons that the Under-Secretary well knows—the frustration and division, the anger and bitterness, that will result from council house sales. But let us assume for the moment that that does happen, and that, as a result of that transfer from rent to mortgages, there is a substantial shortfall on the assumed income, and not merely the rent income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking about the local authority having been wicked, in the Under-Secretary's view, and having failed to put up sufficiently the rents which are still being paid. I would understand that from his point of view, much as I would deplore it, those were self-inflicted wounds, and a local authority would have to live with them. Let us assume that, because of the success of the Government's policy, there are much larger sales of council houses than anyone had expected, and, as a result, housing support grant is too small, because the actual income is much lower than the assumed income. What provision will there then be for compensation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may tell us what, for example, when calculating the assumed rent income, he is putting in as a factor for the loss of assumed rent income because houses are being taken out of the rent pool during the year by sales. If the policy is a success, as he rather wildly at times claims—presumably he believes his own rhetoric on this, even though other people are
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
sceptical—there ought to be a substantial adjustment to those figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman should appreciate that, if he and I are correct in our assumption that the number of sales may be even greater than was expected, although that might mean that the rent income of a local authority was less, it would mean that the housing support grant which it received was greater than it would otherwise have been entitled to. So the odds are that one will balance out the other. If the estimates of sales cannot be less than the actual sales, the housing support grant will be higher than it would otherwise have been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must try to follow this. It is quite complicated, and it is important to understand it. As I understand it, the individual local authority's housing support grant is made up of its eligible expenditure less its relevant income. The relevant income, and an important part of that income, is the assumed rent revenue. During the course of that year the assumed rent revenue may actually fall because of council house sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State's estimate of the number of council house sales had been spot on—I agree that it is difficult—he would have said that 10 per cent, of the housing stock would shift an average, say, six months through the year out of the housing revenue account into the capital side because it was converted from rent to mortgage. The assumed rent income must therefore be reduced by that extent, and the gap between eligible expenditure and assumed rent income would increase. Therefore, the share of the total HSG cake going to that authority would increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am asking is what kind of calculation the Minister is making. It is not beyond the wit of man to think of areas and authorities where there is a lower propensity to buy, perhaps because of economic circumstances, urban deprivation and unemployment, or the nature of the housing stock, its age and composition. I do not want to raise hackles by mentioning individual areas, but I can think of some districts in which the Minister will accept that council house sales are likely to be very low, certainly in the next two or three years. There are other areas in which the council housing stock is much more desirable and popular, and sales are likely to be high. That is a distortion factor which must be taken into account in deciding on the estimate of rent income for housing support grant purposes. The Committee will be as interested as I am in the answer to these questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that possibly it is wrong to assume that the sale of council houses will actually raise assumed rent income. I accept that that is not taken into account. But the mirror image effect inevitably arises from what the Under-Secretary has said, and he must try to deal with that during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with the issue of the sale of council houses and its effect on the machinery that is altered by the clause, I should like to raise a number of other points about relevant income and the effect of subsection (4A) (
	<i>a</i>). Relevant income is the assumed rent income plus the rate fund contribution. This is something that we have debated on other occasions in a more political sense, and I do not intend to go over the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
political in-fighting that results from it. But we all know that the Government took a very arbitrary decision about the rate fund contribution which would be allowable for HSG calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I remember rightly—I am talking from memory here—it was decided that of the total income of local authorities in Scotland the rate fund contribution would be held at 16 per cent. There were some surprising figures of individual local authorities which you will no doubt recall, Mr. Gourlay. For example, Glasgow's rate fund contribution was fixed arbitrarily at £9 million, whereas in the previous year it had been as high as £27 million. The result was the imposition of a totally arbitrary per capita figure—perhaps the Minister will tell us on what basis it was arrived at, because I never really understood it—of £12.028782 per head. The result was a distorted picture of reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard example that everyone has been using is that of Eastwood and Clydebank, because both have just over 50,000 people but a very different housing stock composition. Clydebank has about 11,000 council houses and Eastwood about 2,000. Therefore, the rate fund contribution per house in one case was as low as £52 and in another as high as £308. I award no prizes for getting them the right way round. It was Eastwood that was enormously favoured by this system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that, as a result of the Government's holding the rate fund contribution down in this arbitrary and unreasonable fashion, an enormous gap was created between income and expenditure which could not be filled by the housing support grant, because that had been predetermined by the Minister. Of course, the gap had to be made up by rents, and we had the request—the demand almost, the pistol at the head— to local authorities in Scotland that the Secretary of State wanted 40 per cent, on rents. In Glasgow, for example, it was 70 per cent. The whole thing was buttressed—if that is the right word—by the kind of crude sanction of the link between the predetermined rent levels and the housing capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever else he has done, the Minister has shown a remarkable ingenuity in the production of new sanctions. Under the present Government, sanctions against local authorities are always in season. I do not intend to list them, because it would take too long, but there have been a remarkable number of innovations of this kind. The result is that rents as a percentage of total local authority income have shot up from 50 per cent, last year to 63 per cent, this year for the purpose of HSG calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to open old wounds, because I recognise that we are not debating whether the HSG has been properly arrived at in political terms. There have been some hostages to fortune given there. The Under-Secretary made some remarks during the HSG debate about the unreasonable level of council house rents in Scotland and the fact that the average Scot spent more on drinking or smoking than he spent on his house. No other connotation could be put upon these remarks than that he felt that—as a matter of social policy, not a financial necessity—rents should rise. I do not intend to become involved in that argument, except to give him fair warning that we shall no doubt return to it on many other occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What all that means, and why I have described that briefly—and it is briefly, in terms of a very com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
plicated system—is that we have a housing support grant settlement which quite clearly has been manipulated. It has been manipulated in order to raise rents artificially, presumably for dogmatic reasons in line with Tory philosophy on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return almost triumphantly, Mr. Gourlay, to clause 18. We have a new provision in that clause which allows the Secretary of State, entirely at his discretion, to produce a formula which will ensure that by using the new provision in subsection (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) the Government will be able to take local authorities out at the bottom of the system. There is no doubt about that, because the criterion in subsection (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) is that their income will exceed the amount of their expenditure. But, as I have perhaps rather laboriously been establishing, income—on which I have concentrated, but one could do the same for expenditure— is not in real figures. It is not based upon historical outturns. It is not based upon actual estimates made by the individual local authority. They are figures which are picked by the Secretary of State, no doubt in consultation with local authorities as a group, but not necessarily tailored to the needs of an individual authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: hope that the hon Gentleman will make it clear that his latest remarks simply describe the system which has operated over many years, certainly since the beginning of the housing support grant system, when the Secretary of State has had, in exactly the same way, the discretion to determine relevant income. He may not like the way in which the Secretary of State at present is exercising that discretion, but I hope that he is not suggesting that there are any new powers which the Secretary of State has to manipulate the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that there are any new powers. I am suggesting what the situation has been, not over many years, because I think the first housing support grant settlement was in 1978-79. I am merely discussing, as I have a duty to do at this stage, how that system is working in relation to this clause, because a new element is brought in. That is the new element for which the Under-Secretary is responsible, the idea that now authorities can be taken out of the aggregate calculation, and, as we will prove in a minute or two, when we come to clause 19, out of the individual apportionment, on the basis of the fact that their income exceeds their expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about that is that the income does not actually need to exceed the expenditure. As we discovered when we looked at subsection (4A)(
	<i>b</i>), it may in fact be the other way round, for all sorts of technical reasons. It may be the other way round also for the reason that we have been discussing, in terms of the sale of council houses. What will happen is that it will allow the Secretary of State to drop out of the whole HSG system an increasing number of local authorities. We are very anxious to know how he will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier Nithsdale, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, and Eastwood. What I think is at the back of our mind is that by using the provisions of subsections (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) and (4A)(
	<i>b</i>), and manipulating the arbitrary factors which make up the expenditure and income
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
figures, the Government may reduce the 56 local authorities not by the two or three that are obvious candidates for execution, because of the small, nominal grant that they are receiving, but by a large number of local authorities, knocked out of the HSG formula with devastating results to the support grant system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may be scandalised by that kind of suggestion. He may tell me that that is nonsense, that there is no such sinister implication in this innocent technical amendment, but let us look at the Government's own projection, in Cmnd. 7841, the White Paper on public expenditure. If we look at table 4.1, an infamous part of a deplorable document, we see that by 1984 it is expected that the housing support grant will have dropped by, I think, some 42 per cent. Every year swingeing cuts are being made to keep us on line with that target. Last yeat it was £228 million, and this year it is £140 million, a drop of about 34 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries us is that subsection (4A) may be used to drop local authorities out of the housing support grant system, to disqualify them by so manipulating their eligible expenditure and relevant income that the Government can triumphantly say "They come under (4A)(er), and therefore we will not put them into the housing support grant system. Therefore, we can reduce housing support grant even further."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that on reflection the hon Gentleman will appreciate that if that is what subsection (4A) permitted the Secretary of State to do the convention would be strongly opposing this provision, which it is not doing. I am sure he appreciates that, even assuming his hypothesis were to be entirely justified, it would in no way need the subsection to do it. All that it ensures is that the aggregate of expenditure is not adversely affected because an individual authority is estimated to be in surplus. Even if his hypothesis were entirely justified, that could be done under the existing law. Subsection (4A) is, as COSLA has recognised, a protection to local authorities, not a threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder. COSLA may well take that view, but we are still entitled to ask the questions, and the Minister has given an answer which is not necessarily very comforting. What he has said is that it would be perfectly possible to eliminate, obliterate, liquidate large parts of the HSG, according to the White Paper graph, without having to use subsection (4A). That may well be true, but it seems to us that there is another possible way of doing it. Perhaps a number of different methods could be used, and this is possibly just another way of achieving the same thing. This is a good opportunity for the Minister, I will not say to make a policy statement, but to indicate exactly what he sees as the future shape of things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could in fact do two things. One could cut the HSG, as the White Paper envisages, as a global total and slice it very thinly. That would be one way of doing it. Or one could use subsection (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) and so manipulate it that one certainly had a smaller global total but one also had a smaller number of local authorities sharing in it, and therefore the slices for the individual authorities which survived would be some-
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
thing more nearly approaching what would have been expected had the global total remained the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Under-Secretary takes the distinction, which is one of some importance. With the kind of calculations that he will make—after all, it is a policy decision, because he sets a lot of these figures according to the policy directives which he has in mind and the policy ends which he wishes to achieve—does he expect there to be a radical reduction in the number of local authorities within the HSG system? Or is he saying that he will reduce the HSG to the White Paper target merely by leaving the number of authorities roughly the same and taking down the global total, so that all of them suffer equally and get very small slices of not a cake but a rather miserable bun?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cuts in the HSG last year amounted to about a £100 loss of subsidy per council house in Scotland, I think that in 11 authorities it was as much as £145 per house. That is at a time of economic depression and economic difficulty. I recognise all the special pleading about rebates and direct payments on supplementary benefit. No doubt as a result of the happenings on the employment front the number of people who will escape these increases in the short term will probably go up, and none of us should take any pleasure in that. Every time we force up rents we go back to a situation in which, when things are, hopefully, recovered in economic terms, the nominal level on which future increases will be built is higher and higher. That is something which we must continue to fight to the best of our ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to have a glimpse into the future. It may be that what we see will give us no consolation, no cheer and no encouragement, but we are prepared to steel ourselves to hear a little bit of the innermost thoughts of the Under-Secretary on what will happen to the housing support grant over the years. We wish to know whether it is a matter of reducing the number of authorities, therefore leading to a reduction in the size of the global sum, but leaving quite a reasonable slice for those which survive, or whether it will be short rations and short commons all round merely because he will cut violently and viciously—as he has been doing in the last couple of years—the HSG down to his 1984 total. I hope that he will be able to give us some of these insights and give us some sort of picture of what lies ahead of us on what I believe will continue to be a pretty stony and uncomfortable journey through what I hope will be the comparatively short remaining period of the Conservative Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a strange world. I know that one cannot blame the Government for all of it, but this is a strange Committee as well, because today it is as if the Committee were completely different. The atmosphere and the interest are completely different. Sometimes on the Government Benches we have had little more than the Under-Secretary and the Whip, and we do not seem to have done much better on the Opposition side. I wonder whether we are in a state of shock following the announcement about Linwood yesterday, or indeed the prospect of what will happen to the mines in Scotland and elsewhere under the Government's policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
However, we should not let that state of shock detract from the consideration of this clause or make us do other than understand that this is a very important issue. The Government's rent policy is basically brought out by the clause, taken in association with the housing support grant order. The rents policy of this Government is a frightening prospect for the ordinary people of Scotland. It is not just an esoteric matter of the particular clauses and amendments, but it is a matter that affects every council house tenant in every district in Scotland. The Government's policy on incomes, although allegedly they do not have one, is one of very stringent control of increases in wages. I will come to that in a moment, but quite separate from that, their rents policy is probably the most important thing that concerns people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take what is being suggested by the Government, if we take the clause in association with the housing support grant order, we will see that there is a deliberate policy—a deliberately stated policy—of switching from income from HSG to income from rents. The suddenness of the switch makes the change even worse. It would be bad enough if there was a gentle switch in ensuring that local authorities' income on housing moved from HSG to rents, but there is a major change year by year—a huge change—in policy which is causing ructions in every district of Scotland, which is creating tremendous problems for the council house tenants. Rent increases over the last two years have been running far in excess of inflation and the wage increases which are being allowed by the Government's wages policy, whether it be a stated wages policy or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like me, the Under-Secretary is in a relatively fortunate position, but I would ask him and the Government to consider the position of people in local authority houses who are limited in their wage increases to something of the order of 6 per cent, by the Government's policy, and in many cases less than that. In many cases that I know of they are not even getting that 6 per cent., and yet the rents are being forced up by factors of 40 per cent, and more. Where do these people find the money? Where are they going to get the money when their wage increases are limited to 6 per cent.? Where are they going to get the money to pay these rent increases? It is clear that there are going to be more and more families in difficulties. They will have to cut back on all other expenditure. More and more people will be in rent arrears. More and more social problems will be created by what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from that, if one examines the different aspects of the Government's policy, it will be seen that there is a deliberate and clear intention to move towards a national rents policy. I ask the Under-Secretary to confirm, either now or later on, that it is the clear intention of the Government that there should be a national rents policy; that people in similar houses in similar parts of the country—irrespective of their social conditions and irrespective of the conditions of that particular area—should be paying the same sort of rent. That certainly seems to be emerging from everything that the Under-Secretary and the Government are proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implications of a national rents policy are far-reaching. It means that in the most important areas of district council responsibility—namely, that of housing —they have lost autonomy completely. First of all in
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act, where the Government have taken away the power for local authorities to decide whether they wish to dispose of houses, and, secondly, in this Act and in the associated orders that the Government are promulgating, there is a clear indication that the Government are deciding what the rents of every local authority house in every district of Scotland should be. That means that local authority councillors have little or no autonomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In previous debates we discussed the question of the rate support grant and, whether we like it or not and whether or not the Under-Secretary says it is a new principle—I concede he has an argument there—all that he is doing is taking a principle that has been accepted previously and screwing it down a bit more tightly. He is screwing the local authorities down. So, in the case of district councils, there are local authorities that now have no control whatever over what the level of rates should be, no control whatever over what their level of rents should be and no control whatever over whether or not they should sell houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the best will in the world, Mr. Gourlay, how are we to get people of good stature and experience to serve in these local authorities? This is the beginning of the end of local government. It will be impossible to find people of calibre to serve on district councils. It is difficult enough at the moment. They are paid a pittance. They lose a great deal in attendance at local authority meetings because they lose wages and get a very small pittance to attend. In most cases they actually lose money because of their service in local government. So how are we to get people of calibre and experience to participate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national rents policy on which the Government are clearly intent has many implications. Previously there were some low-rent authorities—Saltcoats is the one that is quoted again and again—but these local authorities made conscious decisions to keep the level of rents low because they felt that it was important for the people in their area to have rents lower. They recognised the social need. They were willing to take the consequences in terms of the level of rates. They were also supported by sympathetic Governments, including some previously representing the political persuasion of the Conservative Party, who recognised that certain areas, because of the social needs and difficulties, should have low rents. There was an important element there. A succession of Governments recognised that this was important for local authority autonomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this national rents policy—this overall look which the Government are taking at local authority housing—must be linked with the the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act. The Under-Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but it is the best houses that are being sold off by the local authorities. We have said this on a number of occasions and it is being borne out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the implications of that on what we are discussing today? It means that the houses that are being sold off are the ones which are less likely to require maintenance and improvement because they are the best stock. That means that the ones that are left are the ones which, on average and on the whole, need more maintenance and more money spent on them. It means that the ones that are left are less likely to produce income from rents and are likely to need
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
more money spent on them. Therefore, it will be much more difficult for local authorities to maintain the remaining stock of houses and they are likely to receive less money to carry out that maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two authorities in Scotland, thankfully, are standing up to the Government although I do not always agree with the method by which they are doing so. But it is interesting, in terms of our belief in democratic structures, to take Dundee district council, which is one that is vilified by the Government time and again. The majority of members of Dundee district council stood in May 1980 on a platform of keeping rents down and not selling off council houses. They were elected on that platform. They have a mandate for that, just as much as the Government have a mandate for their policies. In fact, they have a much greater mandate in Scotland. They have a mandate, which the Government do not have in Scotland for their policies of selling off council houses and putting rents up.

Although as you said, Mr. Gourlay, the hon Gentleman's is not strictly relevant, I feel strongly about it and I shall continue to repeat that the Government have no mandate in Scotland. Had more people in Scotland accepted my advice, this kind of Bill could not

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about clause 18, the title of which is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Method of fixing aggregate amount of housing support grants."</p></blockquote>
I sometimes find it difficult to understand what is going on. The word "fixing" is well chosen. I recently had discussions with my colleagues in Cumnock and Doon Valley district council. I ask the Under-Secretary to direct his attention to that authority. He does not do it often enough. He is understandably engrossed in the problems of the Lothian region and of other authorities, such as Dundee district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cumnock and Doon Valley has had relatively low rents. They are not the lowest in Scotland, but it has tried to keep rents at a modest level. The maintenance of its council houses is relatively good—again, not the best. I have complaints about maintenance at my surgeries. But it has introduced central heating to most council houses and has tried to keep its housing stock in reasonably good order. Its other costs are not particularly high. I have not always agreed with it, but since the Tory Party took over it has gone along with Government policies on rate support grant and housing. On many of the Under-Secretary's criteria, there could not be a better authority, yet under the current rate support grant it is one of the authorities which have been hammered. It has had one of the largest reductions in housing support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the logic of that? Local authority members are asking what good it does to do what the Government ask, by adhering to the law and saying, "We accept that this is an elected Government. We shall look forward to the next Labour Government but we shall go along with the district council", when they are hammered worse than other authorities, including some which are not adhering to Government policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon Gentleman taken the trouble to find out why Cumnock and Doon Valley has lost out in the current housing support grant? If he has, he will find that it is not because of any whim, penal action or unfair attitude of the Secretary of State. Cumnock and Doon Valley was one of the authorities that benefited most from the transitional arrangements which were introduced to help authorities bridge the gap between the old housing support grant system and the new housing support grant system. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, knowing that one or two authorities such as Cumnock and Doon Valley would lose out, recommended to the Secretary of State that transitional arrangements should come to an end in the current year. They are gradually being phased out. The Secretary of State accepted the view of the convention and as a consequence Cumnock and Doon Valley has been one of the few authorities which, because they most benefited from the transitional arrangements, have lost out in the current year. It was quite wrong, if the hon Gentleman knew that, to suggest that it was somehow due to the Secretary of State acting unfairly, because it was nothing of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, what I said—and I ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
the Under-Secretary to go back over what I said—was that here is an authority which is doing the kind of thing that the Secretary of State wants it to do, yet it ends up being hammered. I did not blame the Secretary of State. I have thousands of other opportunities of blaming the Secretary of State. But if in his discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities the Secretary of State says that he has some concern, interest and sympathy with the authorities that do his bidding; if he is to step in and tell them what their level of rate and everything else is to be; if that is his philosophy—I am not saying that it is mine—he should step in and help to protect some of these authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he understands the housing support grant system, the hon Gentleman will know that the Secretary of State does not come to an individual judgment as to how much money to give to each individual authority. The aggregate amount that an individual authority receives is a logical consequence of the distribution formula that is agreed between the Secretary of State and the convention. The Secretary of State cannot say "This is the distribution formula which the convention want and which I shall accept but, because Cumnock and Doon Valley—or any other authority—have behaved responsibly on rent, I will give them £X million more". He has no power to do that and it would be quite inappropriate for him to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Under-Secretary said, it is precisely the change in the distribution formula which I understand. I am not an expert on housing support grant, as he knows. I concede that. There are other things that I know a little about, but I shall try to learn about housing support grant. I understand that it is the change in the formula that has affected Cumnock and Doon Valley, that he as the Under-Secretary is a party to changes in this formula and that, if he has some genuine concern for these authorities he should use his authority, power and influence in the discussions to say that there are authorities which are being hammered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very active in COSLA and other areas and I know that small districts such as Cumnock and Doon Valley have very little power within the large convention. If the Under-Secretary is interested in the underdog—in the smaller authorities—and if he is concerned about the authorities which at least in some way go along with his policies and edicts, I should have thought that he would have had some responsibility to help them. Unfortunately he has not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman ought to appreciate that it is precisely because of the effect that it has on these small authorities that there have been transitional arrangements since 1978. Strict interpretation would automatically have brought in the new system. Successive Governments agreed that, in order to modify the effect on authorities that would lose out because of the new arrangement, there should be a transitional phase. It was understood all along that this was transitional, not permanent, and, because of that, it has been gradually phased out. As a consequence—and this was known a long time ago—this is the year in which the transitional arrangements have come to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The Under-Secretary has
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
explained it very well and I do not disagree with him. But it boils down basically to the fact that it does not matter whether or not a local authority goes along with the Secretary of State, whether or not it does his bidding, because it ends up the same in the end. That seems to be the case. There does not seem to be any advantage in adhering to what the Government are suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deviating a little from the matter before us. I should have thought that the Under-Secretary of State and the Government in general ought to have a much more flexible system of making allocations of housing support grant. It ought to be possible for the Exchequer first of all to support local authority housing to a much greater extent especially at this time, with the present economic problems and restrictions on increases in incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing is a basic vital need. We all know that two of the important elements in our lives, before we go on to talk about luxuries, are a job—it is difficult enough to find a job under the present Government—and a roof over one's head. For most of the people of Scotland it has been the local authority—and it will remain the local authority—that provides a roof over their heads. Yet they are to be penalised because of the policies of the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in the forthcoming discussions about rent increases, unlike what happened in the great rates debate—the put-up job that took place in Edinburgh on Sunday—the district councils will be able to pin the responsibility for rent increases where it really lies. It was regrettable that in the case of the rent increases in Renfrew district council all the publicity indicated that it was the district council that was under attack from the tenants. It was the district council that was being blamed for the rent increases, whereas we all know, and it ought to be made clear to the public outside, that it is on the Government that the responsibility lies, that it is a deliberate policy of this Government to increase council house rents. I hope that that message will come out loud and clear. It will not do so from the Committee at this stage, but I hope that it will on a number of other occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the Government's difficulties when they require amending legislation is that they seek to do it through a miscellaneous provisions Bill, and that gives us the opportunity to raise the whole question, quite legitimately and in order, of the level of Government support to housing authorities in Scotland. I think that the Minister would accept this. May I refer him, therefore, to something which he said earlier. It was perhaps relevant to clause 13, but it is relevant here as well. On 29 January he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I merely indicated that the Government were satisfied that for the forthcoming year it would be inappropriate to include housing expenditure, which comes under housing support grant, in any question of whether the rate support grant should be withdrawn. It may well be that we would come to a similar conclusion for future years. But I simply indicated to the hon Gentleman's hon Friend that I did not feel able to give an absolute, binding assurance to that effect."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 January 1981; c. 205.]</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with a clause entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Method of fixing aggregate amount of housing support grants".</p></blockquote>
What the Government do is to decide the amount of resources available and then the formula has to fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
I think that my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is a wee bit unfair in not accepting that the real attack was on some of the other points he was making about the declining level of support by the Government for housing generally, rather than on the distribution difficulties of the Cumnock and Doon valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under what circumstances will these housing support grant calculations be excluded from the rate support calculations? The Minister said that it was for this year only, and that he could not give any further indication. I am not too clear what the relationship is between the one calculation and the other for the purposes of what the Government have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish next to ask the Minister about the representations that have been received. I was somewhat disappointed to read a written reply from him saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My right hon Friend has received 25 representations about this Bill, including a number from ratepayers and ratepayers' organisations supporting the Bill's aims".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 3 February 1981; Vol. 998, c. 69.]</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Assessors Association was concerned with clauses 1 and 2 and I cannot remember the Minister referring to that at the time, although it is the fault of the association for not telling some of us that it had made representations. Of all the representations mentioned in that reply, the only one that refers specifically to part III—of which clause 18 is part—is Shelter, and I think that it has got it wrong. I am surprised, because with all the general discussions about so many factors in the housing scene just now I thought that there would have been more representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was quite right in probing some of these matters. I certainly do not feel that I need to apologise, and I do not think that any of my hon Friends need to apologise, for the general subsidy arrangements that were introduced following our Green Paper. I am often surprised, when I go back and read it, by how good it was. I just wish the Government would read it more often, because the principles are quite sound. Though clause 18 makes a minor adjustment—and I concede that it is a favourable adjustment in terms of the strict calculations that are required—there are many questions that the Minister needs to answer about the level of housing support which follows from the method of fixing the aggregate amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the new factors. The principles of the HSG are still quite sound. The Minister will agree that basically it is an attempt to give the greatest help to the authorities with the greatest need. That is a marvellous principle until we start trying to define it to be fair between one authority and another. New factors have arisen since the Act was put on the statute book. We are dealing with one of those new factors here—the possibility of some authorities being in surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the Minister to explain in more detail the effect of sales on public expenditure. He argued that the effect of sales had nothing to do with the HSG calculations because, as he said, it is in connection with the non-HSG calculation. But I am sure he will accept that sales have something to do with the overall
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
level of public expenditure calculations and, therefore, if it is true—and I would argue that it is true—that the level of HSG is decided by the Government in terms of what is available, obviously other items of public expenditure in the housing field have a direct influence on the Government's decisions. Therefore, I argue that although the Shelter point dealing with paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is wrong—in other words, that the receipts referred to there have nothing to do with the receipts from the sale of council houses—it would be as well to clarify that for the benefit of Shelter, the Committee and anybody else who is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a gross manipulation by the Government of the housing policies of housing authorities in Scotland at present. They are controlling in an almost vindictive way the capital borrowing of the authorities because that is the major element in the housing support grant calculations. One of the hopes for the new subsidy arrangements was that they would give aid to those with substantial building programmes ahead and, therefore, substantial loan charges facing them. If the Government are now strictly controlling the capital borrowing, and tying into that the sale of council houses, they are discriminating against the freedom of local authorities. I will not say anything further on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the narrow interpretation of the clause and of what it is doing—amending section 1 of the 1978 Act— we accept that there is some merit in this minor adjustment of the calculation. But I condemn the Government for, among other things, pursuing policies which are not likely to improve the quality of housing in Scotland. The level of support is ridiculously low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to patronise when I say that the Minister is a skilful debater, but on the question of rents, which he dragged into the discussion on the HSG, we should all be challenging the fact that 50 per cent, of council tenants need help in one way or another. The Opposition are probably as guilty as the Government of not doing more to improve the conditions of people on low incomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend agree that if the Government get their wish in the coming year, and there is an average increase of 40 per cent, in an area like Glasgow, in particular, a large number of new tenants will be brought within the rebate ambit, and that that 50 per cent, figure will become almost farcical? There will be a clear majority of all tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. One of my weaknesses is that I am not guilty of using exaggerated language, but I still feel that there is a lot of trouble ahead for all of us, especially in large housing estates. I do not want to mention Wester Hailes, for other reasons, but the Minister must recognise the position in areas like Linwood, for example, that will be decimated. This is relevant to the method of fixing the aggregate amount of HSG, because the number of people receiving rent rebates is a factor in some of the calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government stand indicted on their whole economic policy. They are having to pursue that. I have some sympathy for the personal position of anybody in any Government. I do not know whether the Leader of the House is making a bid for the leadership of the Con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
servative Party. It will be interesting to see where the Under-Secretary stands in the in-fighting that is obviously going on in the Conservative Party. The Minister laughs, but he knows there is something in it. No Government can survive the increasing tensions that are facing society, and indeed facing communities that are largely, if not entirely, dependent on the level of Government support for council houses and for council building, without serious repercussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether we shall oppose the clause, because it is a technical improvement in the calculation of something which is fundamental to the whole of the housing scene in Scotland. It is disgraceful that the level of support at a time of increasing difficulty is declining. For those reasons the Government stand condemned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a fairly general debate. I am happy to respond to the points that have been raised. Both the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) and the hon Member for South Ayshire (Mr. Foulkes) made reference to the document which Shelter had submitted to members of the Committee on this and other clauses in this part of the Bill. In the past, although it has not always agreed with the Government, Shelter has been very constructive in its suggestions and has clearly shown an understanding of the meaning of legislation. But it seems to be at sea as to the significance of these clauses. It has produced a whole series of allegations as to what it believes to be the sinister consequences of implementing these proposals, allegations which show an almost total misunderstanding of the effect of these clauses. The convention recognised the need for them, the hon Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) recognises it, and it is somewhat surprising that Shelter has failed to do its homework properly on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for South Ayrshire referred to the position in Dundee district council. I was absolutely shocked and aghast to read that Mrs. Margo McDonald, on behalf of Shelter, is apparently giving support to the council's desire to defy the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act. It is extraordinary that a responsible charity should, on the face of it, if it is being quoted correctly, be apparently willing to condone an attempt by a local authority to defy an Act of Parliament. I should have thought that, on reflection, Shelter would wish to disassociate itself from that remark, and it would be astonishing if it did not do so. Apart from anything else, as a charity it is in a delicate position on matters of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds to me like a threat from the Minister that, if Shelter does not desist from criticising the Government and supporting people who do criticise the Government, it will have its charitable status withdrawn. The Minister ought to withdraw that threat, because he can have influence on the Inland Revenue with regard to charitable status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's anger is somewhat phoney, and I am glad to see that he is smiling. He knows perfectly well that that is hogwash. What I was saying—and I have no desire to withdraw it—is that it is shocking when any charity appears to be condoning an attempt by a local authority to defy an Act of
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
Parliament. I do not think the hon Gentleman would wish to condone it. In fact, he himself implied that he would not necessarily go along with such an authority, and he nods his head in agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will, however, surely agree with me that Shelter, as an informed and expert body with a strong point of view, is entitled to express it. The Minister's shock is merely to discover yet again that somebody is disagreeing with him and is not in any way to imply that Shelter is not entitled to that view or that in some way a charity should not be expressing views which go to the heart of the argument in Scotland. Will he not accept that Shelter is reacting to what it sees in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act as a wrong-headed, socially divisive and bitter move which should not be on the statute book at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shelter is perfectly entitled to criticise the Act, to condemn it and to disapprove of it entirely. The only point that I was making was that it is no more appropriate for Shelter than it would be for anyone else —in fact, less so as a charitable organisation—to write to a local authority supporting its decision not to implement its statutory obligations as approved by Parliament. That is the only point which concerns us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that we have been dragged into this, but there seems to me to be still an implication that in some way the charitable status of Shelter is at issue here. I believe that Shelter is entitled to express what views it likes. It so happens that in its general approach to the tenants' rights Act I agree with it 100 per cent. In the same way I believe that local authorities are entitled to have a certain amount of discretion in how they approach matters of policy. But I think it deplorable if the Minister is returning to the theory that in some way, because of its charitable status, it should be inhibited or debarred from making the kind of policy statement that it has made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for debate in this Committee. The Minister has made his point clear, as have the Opposition. Now perhaps we can get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no need to waste any more of the Committee's time. The word which the Minister used is, I understand, a parliamentary expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I chose the parliamentary expression, Mr. Gourlay, but I can assure the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) that, despite his surname, the remark was in no way directed towards him. If he thought that in any way it was, I withdraw the implication.

I turn to the specific points that have been raised. The hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred to paragraph 
	<i>(b).</i> It has proved necessary retrospectively to amend the 1978 Act, which purported to suggest that, in calculating housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
support grant, it was necessary to put on the other side of the equation housing support grant. That is clearly nonsense, and it is right that it should be rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman asked, in relation to the provisions of subsection (4A), how many authorities would have been left out in 1981-82 because they were in surplus. Nithsdale is the only authority that would have been affected in the current year. It is interesting to explain to the Committee why the clause is necessary. Nithsdale's surplus of income over expenditure is approximately £¾ million. The aggregate of housing support grant is £¾ million less than it would otherwise have been, because that had to be put into the equation. Clearly, if that applied to a number of other authorities, it would add up to a significant amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow that. But a bit of gloss is being put on here. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) drew attention to the fact that all Ministers—I am not attacking this particular Minister —start off with what they think the housing support grant should be and then do the formula, factors and calculations in order to get the predetermined result. When the Minister says that there would have been another ££ million on the housing support grant, that presupposes that the housing support grant is objectively arrived at. If the calculation reaches a higher result, the Minister accepts it. Is it not the position that the Minister would have adjusted the calculations in order to take account of that additional £¾ million and to remove it in some way in the formula?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the anomaly had resulted in a large sum of money—many millions of pounds—it might have been necessary to make some adjustment. But it is clear that, although the effect might be only at the margin, there could still be the effect that I have indicated. If we are dealing with what, on a housing support grant of £150 million, may be only £1 million or £2 million, my point is valid—that the aggregate could be affected in the way suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have indicated that if, in the current year, these provisions had applied, Nithsdale would have been the only authority affected. It is, of course, impossible to be certain how many authorities may apply next year or in subsequent years. It could reach double figures next year, but we cannot be certain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman has referred to a number of authorities which receive a very small amount of housing support grant. Eastwood was one and Cumbernauld and Kilsyth another. There are a number of authorities whose entitlement to HSG is very small. It is not possible to be certain how many would be affected by this, but the more that were affected the more that would be to the benefit of the aggregate of HSG in the event of a change of this kind not being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman asked what sort of income, apart from the income from rent and the rate fund contribution, would be taken into account as a result of the amendment in subsection (4A) (
	<i>c</i>), on the definition of "relevant income". The reason for this change is that there has been doubt as to whether the term "income", as it has been applied till now, should include payments of service charges by tenants for common heating
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
arrangements, for example, or payments by tenants to the local authority which carries out repairs on behalf of the tenants—in a mixed close, for example, where some houses were owned by the local authority and some privately owned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of shorthand, these have been included in income, till now but there has been doubt as to whether that should have been done. Concern has been expressed as to whether a strict interpretation of the term "income" should properly include payments of that kind. Therefore, in order to clarify that situation it seems more sensible to refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"payments, contributions (including any rate fund contribution) and receipts "</p></blockquote>
to deal with payments that arise in the course of the normal activities of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the clarification is to ensure that those common charges will be included?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is basically to ensure that what has been done up till now, on a wide interpretation of the meaning of "income", can continue to apply and with a more appropriate description in statute as to what the forms of income should represent. It is not intended that there should be any wider application than has been the practice over recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Garscadden and his hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) asked about ithe 'assumptions that had been made concerning the sale of council houses under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. Normally an assumption is made of the number of sales that a local authority is likely to have in a particular year and the relevant income is the income it will receive from the remaining houses in its housing stock. If that turns out to be incorrect, obviously there may be need for an adjustment in a subsequent year. But it is necessary to have some assumption of that kind, and we are, to a significant extent, influenced by the information provided by the local 'authority in question as to what it expects its likely sales to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, in all these matters, if one is dealing with estimates, they cannot be assumed to be scientifically based in the sense of providing a guaranteed accurate indication. They are estimates, and claim only to be estimates. But it is possible in subsequent years to take account of any wide discrepancy that actually arises and, in that way, to protect the position of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that the primary consequence of the sale of council houses is to affect the capital position of the local authority, in that the receipts reduce the loan charges that would otherwise be incurred by the local authority and therefore it benefits in that way. But it does not have any direct effect on the housing revenue account in the way 'that some hon Gentlemen have suggested might be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked to speculate as to what might be future policy on housing support grant. It would not be appropriate for me to do that. The decisions that have been reached have already been announced and are known to hon Gentlemen. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
would not be right for me to hypothesise as to what might happen over the next few years, because no decisions have been reached on that. They will be announced in due course dn the normal way. The housing support grant system is meant to support the local authority in its housing expenditure, but not to be a means of ensuring that the local authority does not have to come to terms with its own responsibilities with an appropriate local contribution from rent and rates to support its housing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Gentlemen indicated that they thought it unsatisfactory and undesirable that 50 per cent, of council tenants in Scotland received some form of assistance with their rents. I would not argue in those terms. I should have thought it sensible to have a level of rents that partly reflected the cost of the property provided and partly reflected what those on average Scottish incomes could reasonably be expected to contribute towards their housing costs but, at the same time, to ensure that those whose income was significanly 'below that level should not be penalised as a consequence. That is why the rent rebates system and the supplementary benefit procedure protect a substantial number of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be ridiculous to suggest that a reasonable increase in rents which could be well afforded by half the Scottish tenants should not be implemented simply because the other half, who will be protected in any event by the rent rebates system, would, but for that rent rebates system, be unduly penalised. In fact, those who cannot afford it are protected in the way that is well known to hon Gentlemen. Therefore, that is a sensible way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18 has been considered by the convention, which does not object to it. It recognises the technical reasons why it is necessary and why it is an improvement on the existing statutory position. On that basis, I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had quite an interesting and useful debate, which has had its surprising features. The hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Eraser) was tempted to his feet, however briefly, and that is an event which should not go unremarked. It turned out that it was a talk about devolution and not the housing support grant, but we should be thankful for small mercies. In any event, an intervention on devolution reminds us that he was a "Yes" man in every sense of the word, as he still is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are disappointed that the Minister has not been able to say a little more about the future. I recognise that it would be wrong to tempt him to anticipate details of future housing support grants. That would not only be an improper expectation of a Minister, but would also be strictly out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked a question which arises directly out of the operation of subsection (4A)(
	<i>a</i>)—the possibility of a reduction in the number of local authorities sharing in the HSG and, therefore, of those that survive as participants in the HSG club maintaining something like the same sum in HSG, but with this strategy of using the new power under subsection (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) to exclude local authorities allowing, in effect, a large
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
reduction of the global total. It would not have been a bad thing if the Minister had felt able to say something about that. He said that it was hypothetical, but he hypothesises with great fluency on many occasions, and it would not have 'been out of order, and it would certainly have been helpful to the Committee, if he had done so on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I only jotted down what 'the Minister said, so the quotation may not be accurate, but the spirit is there. He said that the idea was that the HSG should not mean that the authority did not have to come to terms with its responsibilities in terms of a contribution from rates and rents. But the tragedy of what the Government are doing is that they are stopping local auhorities coming to terms with the responsibility, because they are enforcing upon them what the Government think their reaction to any given situation should be. That is why we are having the heavy loading on rents as against rates which has been such an unpleasant and unjustifiable feature of the local authority scene in -the last few months, or indeed since the Government came to power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister commented on the very pertinent words of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) about the effect of Government policy on the number of people who are receiving rent rebates, direct rent payments through social security benefits. I found the Minister's response hopelessly complacent. With his usual aplomb, he commented with approval on what he said was the situation when what he described as the situation in no significant way reflected reality. He is right that the rent level in Scotland should be set at such a level that the majority of the people who are expected to pay that rent can do so, and he is right in saying that there should be a safety net to help those who, perhaps through no fault of their own—illness, unemployment or whatever—are not in a position to meet the level of rents which can be managed with dignity and in a practical sense by those who are in work and who make up the vast majority of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that was the situation, as the Minister seemed to represent it, that would be fine. But, as we know, it bears no relationship to reality. Over 50 per cent, of tenants are in receipt of some sort of help—a partial or total rebate, or payment of rent by a direct deduction from supplementary benefit. The increase in rents of 40 per cent, which is expected by the Government despite the gallant and proper resistance of a large number of local authorities—I am sure the figure will get up towards that kind of level in Scotland in the coming year—will mean that in constituencies like that represented by my hon Friend the Member for Provan, or in parts of my constituency—I make no bones about saying that I am thinking of the Drumchapel housing scheme— probably 60 or 70 per cent, of tenants will not be able to pay the full rent on their dwelling-house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this with due consideration, and I hope that I am not accused of being flamboyant. It is a situation of high farce that we have a rent structure in Scotland which takes into a category of poverty, because they are not able to meet their rent outlays, the vast majority of the people who live in local authority housing in Scotland. It is an unsatisfactory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
situation and one Which no Government should be able to sweep aside with the complacency that the Minister has shown on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman should not assume that a person who is receiving a rent rebate is necessarily in poverty. A married couple with two children would be entitled to some rent rebate if their income was not above between £4,000 and £5,000 a year. I know that that is not a huge income, but nor would it reflect a position of poverty for the family concerned. Rent rebates, like rate rebates, are available to people with modest incomes, but it would be wrong to suggest that one has to be in poverty to be entitled to a rent rebate. Otherwise, the hon Gentleman would be suggesting that half the Scottish council tenants were in a condition of poverty, which would be utter nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have allowed references to be made to rents and so on, but we are getting a bit wide of the main purpose of the clause. I hope that the hon Gentleman will restrict his (remarks more to the method of fixing the aggregate amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that you have been very tolerant, Mr. Gourlay, in the course of this morning. I was merely picking up remarks made by the Minister. We can argue the toss endlessly about what constitutes poverty, but I would have thought that if the Minister is representing the present level of rents as .reasonable—he went to great lengths to do so in the HSG debate, and he has repeated that allegation today—then if over 50 per cent, of those who are supposed to pay them so manifestly cannot pay them that they have to be helped by the State, his definition of the word "reasonable" in respect of rents is very strange. The rent structure which is being imposed on local authorities in Scotland is unreasonable, inequitable and unjust. The proof of the pudding is that the safety net is bulging with more than half the tenants who have had to be caught and rescued from—I repeat the word—the danger of poverty by the imposition of rents which they cannot reasonably be expected to meet. I leave it there. We shall return many times to this. I tabled some written questions yesterday to try to get the figures of the number of tenants who are receiving rent rebate at present, and who will be receiving it, on the assumption of certain rent increases. I assure the Minister that we shall probe very carefully into this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall get very angry about the impact, and the future impact. I fear that we shall have to wait for a new Government or a new set of economic approaches for this—but when we get economic recovery I very much fear that we shall then be operating from a nominal rent level—I use the word "nominal", because the vast majority of tenants will not have been paying it—which will become the floor on which further increases are calculated. The Minister of the day will be able to say "We are only putting up rents by 10 per cent, or 15 per cent.",
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
but for many people it will in fact be a practical increase of 30, 40 or 50 per cent, or perhaps an infinite increase, because they have not been paying, because of the crazy rent structure which this Government have invented and imposed upon the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear that the only authority that would have been caught this year by subsection (4A)(
	<i>a</i>) was Nithsdale. I take that as an accurate statement of fact from the Minister. I find it a little daunting to hear that the number may rise to double figures during 1982-83. We are talking about only just over 50 authorities. If we are talking of a figure of upwards of 10, my fear that we shall have many authorities tumbling out of the HSG system is not one which can be described as exaggerated or illusory. The Minister himself has mentioned such figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring back to appendix F of the Fifth Report of 'the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland, which has been the subject of comment in earlier sittings, the Committee will remember that 'this was a list of authorities that had rating revenue surpluses at 31 March which were in excess, which were startlingly high percentages of the net income for the year. I accept that the rating revenue surplus is very different from die housing support grant, but if one examines the authorities 'that had these rating revenue surpluses one discovers that one of the facts given about them is that many of them have in addition surplus balances on their housing revenue accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if we take Nithsdale, which has a rating revenue surplus of 92 per cent, as a percentage of net rate income for the year, we know that that is also one which has a surplus on its housing revenue account. So it is a double sinner, so to speak. That is also true of Perth and Kinross, Angus, Moray, Nairn, Wigtown and Stewartry—which not only has a housing revenue surplus but has a rating revenue surplus as a percentage of net rate income of 263 per cent. So it seems to me that many authorities have been building up surpluses, both on 'housing revenue account and rating revenue. They are all, or almost all, as it happens, Tory controlled, and presumably they will all be candidates for falling out of the housing support grant system, which may give pause for thought in certain quarters about the validity of what die Minister is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter that the Minister dealt with— and he dealt with it reasonably helpfully—was the redefinition of the rate fund contribution and the new form of words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"payments, contributions (including any rate fund contribution) and receipts".</p></blockquote>
I was sorry to hear that this was an amendment to ensure that common services charges such as heating bills payable for common heating facilities for the local authority were now included within the definition of "relevant income". I do accept that it has been happening up to now, and I am sure that the Minister would paint that out to me. I accept that it may be that it was happening under a Labour Government when they introduced the housing support grant system. I am not here to underwrite and to endorse everything that has happened in the past, but I should have thought that there was a case for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
saying that these should not toe taken as relevant income of the local authority. They are, after all, presumably merely payments which are recouping expenditure toy the local authority on the heating or whatever the service may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an analogous argument, a minor one but worth praying in aid. When we were looking at private sector rents, and the little order to increase from £78 to £104 the increase in rent in any one year, which was debated in the House some weeks ago, it was made clear that common services were not taken as rent. In other words, the rent increase restriction would apply to the rent element, but if there were common services charges, for common heating, caretaker facilities and so on, they could go up unrestricted, because they were not taken as rent income for the purpose of these restrictions. If they are not rent income for those purposes, there is a case for consistency by saying that they should not be taken as rent income for the purposes of section 7 of the 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is unnecessarily confusing himself. There is no suggestion that it is part of the rent income. It is part of the relevant income of the local authority. As these figures are included in the estimated expenditure of the local authority, in the actual costs it incurs, it would be absurd not to include the payments it receives in respect of that as part of its relevant income. It may be that we could leave it out of the expenditure and out of the income, tout that would have exactly the same effect. What we cannot do with any semblance of logic is to include it as part of the relevant expenditure of a local authority, but to say that the payments that it receives to cover that expenditure should not be included in its income. I am sure that the hon Gentleman is not seriously suggesting that, nor would be wish to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, indeed, I am not seriously suggesting that. The Minister has cleverly anticipated the next part of my remarks. He will be glad to know that I shall just jettison them. I was about to say that it might be logical if I were satisfied that the expenditure for the common services was included in the eligible expenditure. Having been anticipated and having the answer, I shall resist the temptation ad longem to ask the question, which will save a few minutes of the Committee's time and will no doubt be seen as merciful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be a case for leaving out both. I presume that that would be entirely neutral in its effect, but I cannot help remarking in passing that if the justification for changing the law was to allow this to be brought it in, it might have been better not to bother changing the wording but just to leave it out on both sides of the balance sheet. Then we should not have had to discuss and worry about what the amendment to section 1(7) of the 1979 Act included in subsection (4A)(
	<i>c</i>) meant, and we could all have gone for an early lunch a lot happier. In any event, I am satisfied. As long as I know that it is a 'balancing equation the thing is no worse than redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's final point was the assumption on
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
sales. I found that interesting, because we now have on the record what we might have guessed, that when the Minister comes to look at assumed rent income for the purpose of calculating rent income, he is making an assumption—which I gathered from his remarks varied from local authority to local authority—about the number of sales that are likely to transpire during the course of the year, and the assumed rent income is reduced to that extent. Can he briefly give us an idea what percentage of the housing stock he is assuming for each local authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is indicating that he does not have those figures available, but if he could write to me about that to save the bother of a written question it would be interesting to know the basis on which these figures were arrived at and what the variations were from local authority to local authority. Given the difficulties which have arisen between the Minister and local government, many authorities will not be able to give him an estimate or will cheerfully give him an estimate of nil, and I suspect—although I do not know—that he would not be prepared to accept that figure. I should be interested to know how he gets over that difficulty and I should be genuinely grateful if he could cover 'that when he writes to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the impact of council house sales on the housing support grant is important, as it is on the capital side also, Where there is a raging debate, which I shall not enter into, as to whether the sale of council houses will be an advantage or a disadvantage to the financial structure of a local authority. That argument is like the "How long is a piece of string?" argument. Both sides are impervious to reason, and conversion on either side of the argument is totally impossible. In any event, we shall want to monitor that, and I am sure that the 'information that the Minister sends me will help me to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a comparatively brief debate which is now drawing to a close. It is the only section of the Bill which deals with the housing support grant, and I think it was right that we should give it a fair airing on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being encouraged by my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), but it is not fair artificially to prolong these matters, and I do not intend to keep going for the sake of it. I agree with my hon Friend the Member for Provan, who was recently talking about the strains that obviously must be set up within an Administration, given the public expenditure restrains and the desperate butchery which is being done to local authority finance by the Government. If the Minister does not have his Wellington boots on he is certainly splashing about in galoshes, because I feel that he is very much out of step with many of his colleagues on these financial matters. In case he did not recognise it, that was a nicely turned compliment, or as near as he is likely to get from me during the course of this debate.

	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
housing support grant situation wrong. I referred to the fact that the loss of grant last year was £100 per council house on average across Scotland, and I must warn the Under-Secretary that if that trend were to continue and we were to have a cut next year of anything like that amount, housing support in Scotland would be in total chaos. The effect on the rent structure and on the tolerance and patience of local authorities would be disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman made some critical references to the attitude of Shelter and, implicitly, to the attitude of the Dundee district council. If he values reasonable working relationships with local authorities and if he wants to avoid head-on clashes—which none of us welcome, because they represent total breakdown in the normally good relations between central and local government—he will have to recognise that many of the provisions of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 are genuinely misguided, wrong and damaging, and cannot be proceeded with. He must also recognise that he will have to mend his ways and not carry out the extrapolated projections on housing finance in the White Paper on public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 14, line 10, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(
	<i>bb</i>) In section 24 (Complaints not to be entertained regarding anything done before 16th May 1975) there shall be inserted after 'date' the words 'provided that the Commissioner may conduct an investigation if satisfied that in the particular circumstances it would be reasonable to do so.'.".</p></blockquote>
I shall try to be brief, because I do not want to lay myself open to criticism from hon Gentlemen for making excessively long speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment concerns the powers of investigation of the Commissioner for Local Administration, usually known as the local Ombudsman. I start by paying a tribute, in which all members of the Committee will share, to the work done by the local Ombudsman and his officials, which has been very useful to Members of Parliament, the public and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1975 Act, the Commissioner is only empowered to investigate actions since 1975—that is, actions taken by new authorities but not by their predecessor authorities. I accept the general case for limiting the Commissioner's powers of investigation to the period' after 1975. Otherwise, we should be in danger of passing retrospective legislation, and in practical terms it is clearly difficult for a new authority to take responsibility for the actions of its predecessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to deal with a particular administrative problem—where an alleged
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
maladministration before 1975 has become apparent after 1975. Lest hon Members should think that this a purely theoretical point, may I mention the case of a constituent who bought land from a predecessor authority before 1975 and built a house on that land. He subsequently discovered a mine shaft at the back of the house. I need not labour the resulting difficulties and problems. If he could have proved from the records, as a result of investigation by the Ombudsman, that the predecessor authority had known about the mine shaft but had not informed him of it, that would have been enormously helpful to him. I do not prejudge the case as to whether the authority was right or wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not open up the whole general area of action before 1975 to investigation by the Commissioner, because there are a number of limitations in the 1975 Act. It would simply give the Commissioner the discretion, in a few exceptional cases, to take up complaints about maladministration before 1975 which had become obvious only after 1975. It is a very limited amendment, but I think that it would be extremely helpful to a small number of people who have genuine problems and complaints which cannot be investigated under the present legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend's amendment suggests that the local government Ombudsman should be able to look at matters as they affect local people and at the alleged maladministration that took place before 16 May 1975. I can fully understand the reasons why, in respect of the constituency he has to deal with, my hon Friend feels that such an amendment would be an improvement. I must tell him, however, that it would create major problems, not simply in terms of principle but in terms of practicality if such a change were to be made.

The date of 16 May 1975 is not merely an arbitrary date that was fixed but is, as I am sure my hon Friend recognises, the date on which the new local authorities came into operation. Therefore, apart from all the other problems that might arise from now allowing cases that arose earlier than that to be investigated, we would have the very practical problem that, if the Commissioner were to investigate such a case and to find in favour of the complainant, the local authority that would have been responsible for the maladministration had ceased to exist, is not able to be approached to rectify the problem. Therefore, there would be difficulty for successor authorities in dealing with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that that by itself is absolutely conclusive to the argument. I use it as an indication of the difficult complexities that would arise. It is not simply a question of what one would do if the complaint were upheld. There is also the problem of the actual investigation of the complaint. If there were alleged maladministration before 1975, it would have been the responsibility of the members or officials of the authority that no longer exists, and the difficulty in checking records, in finding the necessary witnesses who could speak to the matters that were determined at that time, the absence of rcords, in some oases, of the authority in question, add up to a substantial practical problem.

We also have to take into account the fact that, at present, the Commissioner is entitled to look before 1975 if there is a matter which is incidental to a complaint the substance of which has arisen since 1975. He is not absolutely precluded from looking at anything that happened before the date in question. But, if the substance of (the complaint was before that date, .then, for reasons that I have indicated, there would be this major difficulty, particularly as we are now six years on from that date. Obviously, the further away, .the more difficult it becomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably on matters of this kind one must have a starting date for a new and important change such as this. Whenever one puts down a date, there will be people on the other side of the line who will feel at a disadvantage as a consequence of the date chosen. But I think that, at least on this occasion, given that the date was not an arbitrary one but one which has real relevance following the major reorganisation of local government, it would be difficult to imagine that this matter could be satisfactorily resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the amendment would not make it mandatory upon the Commissioner to investigate such complaints but would allow him discretion to do so. We have consulted the commissioner to obtain his view of the practicality of such a change, and he has advised us that he does not think that such a change would be appropriate, for the sort of reasons that I have indicated to the Committee. If one were to allow such a discretion, I think that even on the face of it it would give a large number of people who wished to take advantage of it the belief that their particular case could be investigated. If we must assume in advance that, in the vast majority of cases, the commissioner would not feel able to exercise his discretion for exactly the sort of reasons that I have indicated, it would be giving the appearance of a change without the reality. It might create far more disappointment than the existing situation. So, for these reasons, I hope that my hon Friend will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is shame, when the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) has broken the self-imposed purdah which has lasted now for 12 or 13 sittings and produced an amendment, that he should be treated in a dismissive but otherwise essentially courteous fashion. I recognise, however, the difficulties that the Minister has outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, for example, if someone said that he had a complaint against a predecessor authority before the reorganisation, it would become extremely difficult, and there would be the danger of an occasional rogue case turning up. I would have thought that the fact that the power was discretionary and not mandatory would have allowed him to see very clearly and very fairly that it was time-barred,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
while he might have been prepared to look sympathetically at something that came in the early 1970s, as the hon Member has outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little unclear, and I am also curious, about the legal point that the Minister made. I have never had any cause to look at it, perhaps fortunately, but he said that the original authority against which the complaint would be laid had disappeared. I can see the practical difficulties about that, in terms of the director of sewerage, or whatever, who might have retired at reorganisation. That is always a danger in any investigation over a timescale. Someone may have died, run away or decided to go and tend his garden. Therefore,' it does not seem to me that that is a unique disadvantage. I would have thought that the successor authority would be responsible for the actions of its predecessor in at least its statutory duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take an example which may be ludicrous, but which will illustrate the point, I have a pension entitlement for my many long and faithful years of service in the Lanarkshire county council—about £200 a year. Clearly, if I have an argument about that with Strathclyde, the successor authority— because the function for which I was working is now a regional one—it would be wrong for Strathclyde to say that the matter had nothing to do with it, that it was Lanarkshire county council that had made the arrangement with me and that that no longer existed, as it had been killed off at reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting for a moment that there is a question of legal entitlement. What I am saying is that in most cases if the Commissioner finds that there has been maladministration he makes a recommendation to the local authority that has been guilty of the maladministration to rectify the problem. It is not legally obligatory on the authority to do so, but if it were the authority that was responsible for the maladministration it would normally feel a moral obligation so to act. But when we are dealing with an authority that no longer exists, it is a much more difficult matter to try to persuade a new authority that was not itself responsible for the maladministration voluntarily to seek to rectify it.

I appreciate that we are unlikely to come to a conclusion on this point before 1 o'clock, and I do not want to hurry hon Gentlemen. Therefore, it might be appropriate now to move that the debate be adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
