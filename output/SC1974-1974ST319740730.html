	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Brewis. Forgive me if it is the ignorance of a new boy, but it occurs to me that it would be extremely helpful to members of Committees of this kind if, when we are informed by the Committee of Selection, or summoned to a meeting of the Committee, the number of the statutory instrument were included in the information available to us. When I inquired of the Vote Office even yesterday about the statutory instrument, it could not find it for me without knowing the reference number. In fact, the statutory instrument was not in the Vote Office and had not been there last week. Could something be done about this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='legislation'>VALUATION (COMBINATION OF COUNCILS) (SCOTLAND) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Valuation (Combination of Councils) (Scotland) Order 1974.</p></blockquote>
I hope to raise this matter briefly. It covers a point of considerable importance to my constituency. Consequent upon the reorganisation of local government in Scotland, four authorities will be combined for valuation purposes if the order goes through in its present form. The four authorities are the Highland region and the three island authorities of Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me remind the Committee of the nature of these authorities. The area of the Highland region itself is, of course, immense and very varied. It not only stretches for hundreds of miles, but contains highland crofts and, at the other end of the scale, Inverness and considerable industrial development. The island authorities of Shetland and Orkney stretch over a distance equivalent to that of
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
from here to York. The north of Shetland is on the latitude of Leningrad. There are the Western Isles, way out to the west, and again covering a large area, though much of it is sea. It is an enormous area of tremendous differentiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the right hon. Gentleman talks of a considerable area covering the distance from here to York, could he tell us in miles the actual size of Shetland, for example, to give us an idea of what he is talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: South of Swona in Orkney up to Muckle Flugga must be about 230 or 240 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a gap of sea between the islands. I am not familiar with the area, but I gather that Shetland and Orkney are two separate islands. As Shetland is the larger, I should like the right hon. Gentleman to give me the dimensions of Shetland so that I may form a rough idea of what he is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mainland of Shetland from its extremes is about 70 miles long and the total length of Shetland from the south of the mainland to the north of Unst must be about 100 miles. I give the figures only to emphasise the differentiation of the size of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The islands are an area of peculiar difficulty for communications, as everyone knows. The islands have an exceptionally high cost of living, because of freight charges. As I understand it, it is justifiable to take these matters into account in fixing valuations. If there is dispute about that, there is a case in which Lord Justice Scott stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… every intrinsic quality and every intrinsic circumstance which tends to push up the value or down must be taken into account".</p></blockquote>
High costs, of course, push down the value of property considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the proposals to combine these four authorities covering an immense area with great differences in the nature of their wealth and occupations. Moreover, there is the problem of the ever higher cost of living in some of the outlying islands. I should make clear that the main opposition to this order comes from the Shetland County Council, backed by the Orkney County
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Council. The Western Isles do not have a county council, so I cannot speak on its behalf. Indeed, I have no direct briefing from the Western Isles, though I am led to suppose that they, to, are not wholly satisfied with this arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our fear is that our valuations will be fixed upon the sort of values that may be appropriate to, say, Inverness, but quite in appropriate to outlying islands. Therefore, there has been strong opposition, and there is still some opposition, to the whole concept of combining these authorities. In fairness it should be said that valuation authorities are combined already, but it is the extent of the new combination that alarmed Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After prolonged correspondence with the Scottish Office, the main points of difference were, however, reduced to three. One was some assurance that if the island representatives could not reach the valuation committee meeting, it would not deal with their affairs. That, I think, is reasonable. The Secretary of State for Scotland felt it reasonable, but felt that it was a matter with which the committee itself could deal. It is customary with other joint authorities, the police authorities and so on, that if the relevant representatives are not there, the committee adjourns, or puts off that particular business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the question of expense. The Scottish Office again saw that there was a point here, but thought it might be dealt with by the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important and remaining point of difference is that the committee will have seven members, four from the Highland region and one each from the three Island authorities. In other words, the Highland region will have a majority over the other three authorities. I emphasise again that these authorities are not districts: they are autonomous authorities conducting the affairs of the three groups of islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Shetland County Council feels that it is very unsatisfactory that three authorities can be outvoted by one. It is argued on behalf of the Scottish Office that the population of the Highland region is much greater than that of the three other authorities, but that in general equal authorities usually get equal representation on joint committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
We would not go so far as to say that each Island authority should have the same number as the Highland region, but my local authorities feel strongly that the Highland authorities should not have an overall majority. They would be content to have an equal number with the other authorities and, in the case of dispute, for the matter to be resolved in the normal way, as in other cases when there is a tie in the voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking that the Scottish Office should look at the matter again on that point, bearing in mind the peculiar position of the three Island authorities, the difficulty of valuation at all, since there is no market for housing on a lot of these islands, the high cost of living in some islands, the immense distances that the authority will cover, the differences in wealth and other circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in some difficulty, Mr. Brewis, because under this procedure, as I understand it, the order has, in fact, come into operation. It may, presumably, be withdrawn—I am not very clear about what is to happen—but ideally we do not want to conduct a long and tedious quarrel with the Scottish Office. The Secretary of State has certainly written to me in a courteous way about the matter and, as I say, has understood several of the points that we have made. But it is a serious matter that one authority should have an overall majority. We should therefore like the older, which cannot be amended by Parliament, to be looked at again in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Milian)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman has said, the first point at issue here is whether there ought to be a combination for valuation purposes of the three Island authorities and the Highland region. It is of course true that at the minute there is a combination for valuation purposes of Orkney, Shetland, Caithness and Sutherland. Therefore, I think that the principle of a combination of one kind or another is accepted. That is the current position and I do not think that there is a difference of principle about whether there should be a combination. The only issue that arises is whether the combination should be restricted to the three Island authorities, as Orkney and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Shetland would prefer, or should also take in the Highland region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of this matter is that the provisions for combination were contained in the Local Government (5) Act of 1973, it then being recognised that the small Island authorities would not be likely by themselves to provide either the population or the valuation that would justify a valuation system or their own The provision was therefore made that the authorities could be combined either one with the other or all together with the Highland region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not quite follow the arguments about distance, the high cost of living and the other difficulties in the Islands and the effect that they might have on the valuations to be determined. The valuation law applies over the whole of Scotland. I am not an expert on the principles of valuation law and I would not attempt in the context of this order to try to explain them to the Committee, but the principles remain the same whether one has a combination or not. The principles, as I understand it, are exactly the same as those upon which valuation is being determined at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the fact that there are particular circumstances within the Islands which may affect the valuations, so far as that is relevant—and clearly it may be very relevant in a number of cases—is already taken care of in the present valuation law. The valuation law is not being altered by this order or in any other way. Therefore, it seems to me that, strictly speaking, this is not relevant to whether there should be a combination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if it were relevant in some sense— it was suggested that an assessor dealing only with the Islands would somehow produce more accurate and more precisely determined valuations than an assessor who was also responsible for the mainland, which, as I say, is a point of view which I could not accept—I do not think that it would be relevant in the context of this particular combination, because Orkney and Shetland have already been combined with bits of the mainland, namely, Caithness and Sutherland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly obliged. What the hon. Gentleman says is perfectly true; the principles of valuation apply
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
over the whole country. But if his argument is pushed to the logical limit, there is no reason for not having one valuation authority for the whole of Scotland. The reason we do not is that it is difficult for a valuer dealing with Glasgow to deal also with Unst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am saying that somewhere we have to draw the line. We do not put the whole of Scotland on one valuation list. But we are afraid that if we have this enormous region it will be difficult to make comparisons, as it would be for the whole of Scotland. The danger is that valuations in Inverness—or something like them—may be applied further north. As I said in my speech, I wholly agree that we are combined with counties that are nearer the way of life, although not identical, of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Orkney and Shetland are combined with Caithness and Sutherland at the moment. Under the provisions of this order they would be combined with the whole of the Highland region. I should not have thought that a vast difference in practicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am making is still valid. The principles of valuation are laid down on an all-Scottish basis. Some of my hon. Friends have argued in the past that there ought to be an all-Scottish valuation service because it would draw attention to disparities between one area and another. But the principles of valuation are the same and therefore the effect of combination on what the ultimate valuations are likely to be is strictly irrelevant. Orkney and Shetland are combined at the moment with areas on the mainland. Therefore, arguments against a combination would be better founded on administrative reasons than on principles of valuation. In fact, the administrative arguments are rather weak, as we already have a combination, which has been agreed by Orkney and Shetland to have worked very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of combination was started in April this year by a letter from the Scottish Office to the authorities concerned. When the letter went out, Orkney informed the Scottish Office that it had no comment to make on what was proposed. It wrote on 17th July supporting representations made by Shetland, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
since the order was made in June, Orkney's first reaction was that it had no comments to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Western Isles Joint Advisory Committee also intimated that it had no comments to make on the order. The Highland Region Joint Advisory Committee found the order satisfactory, but objected to representation on the joint committee because it felt the Highland region should have 10 seats, Western Isles two and Orkney and Shetland one each, which would give a preponderant majority to the Highland region provided through the four-one-one-one arrangement contained in the order. It is true that Shetland objected to the order and suggested that it should not include the Highland region and that the combination should take in the three Island authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are strong arguments for a larger valuation authority, as there will be difficult valuation problems in Orkney and Shetland arising from oil development. It is desirable that we obtain the highest quality staff and organisation as soon as possible. Salaries are determined by the population of the area and, obviously, a combined authority will be able to pay the kind of salaries likely to be attractive to staff with the qualifications laid down for the post of assessor. A number other practical advantages would also derive from a combined authority of the sort proposed by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remain the three points which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. I think he agreed that on two of them the Secretary of State had given what he felt were reasonably satisfactory answers. First, on the question of travel arrangements and difficulties of accessibility, the point was made that if a representative from one of the Island authorities was not able to reach a meeting of the committee, business relating to that authority should not be dealt with by the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to say that the functions of the committee will be quite limited. It will not be meeting, as it were, on a day-to-day basis making policy decisions. The functions of the committee are basically to see that the assessor is appointed, that he has an adequate number of deputy assessors and staff, that the remuneration, allowances and so on are provided for,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
and that accommodation for the assessors is provided. The committee, therefore, is not dealing with policy matters in the sense of in any way determining the principles of the actual valuation. Those are matters in which the assessor has statutory independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The meetings, therefore, are not likely to be very frequent. I should have thought that there was no particular difficulty in the joint Committee deciding as a matter of practice that where there were difficulties of travel and so on, obviously decisions should not be made without the representation from the Islands being there at a particular meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this is the sort of detail that one would lay down in an order. I think it would be open to difficulty and perhaps even abuse to say that if a particular representative was not there, no business could be carried on in relation to his area. That would mean in effect that any authority could boycott the committee and actually frustrate its working. But subject to that, I should have thought that this was a matter with which the administration of the committee could perfectly well deal, and I have no reason to think that the committee will not be able to make satisfactory arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, on the question of the sharing of expenses, the right hon. Gentleman will know that this was laid down in the original order, the draft order which was sent to the constituent authorities. Because of the objection by Shetland, the situation is left to be decided by the joint committee itself. Again, I should have thought that that was acceptable. There is no question, therefore, of the Secretary of State determining how expenses should be split up. This would be a matter for agreement by the committee itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third question, and the one which the right hon. Gentleman felt was the most serious point of difference, is that of representation. As I have said, the present order provides for four from the Highland region and one each from the three Islands authorities. Shetland would like a situation in which the Highland region would not have a majority. On the other hand, the Highland region feels that it ought to have a majority of 10 to 4, on the basis of population and valua-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
tion. Strictly on that basis, of course, that is a perfectly valid point. So there is a real difficulty here in that the proposed constituent authorities do not agree about the basis of representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say that there are already joint committees, combinations for valuation purposes, in Scotland, and the present arrangement whereby the joint committee of Caithness, Orkney, Sutherland and Zetland has a 1-1-1-1 arrangement—equality—is not, in fact, the pattern in other parts of Scotland. It is more com mon with the authorities that are combined in other parts of Scotland for one authority to be very much bigger in terms of population and valuation and to have a majority on the committee. So far as I am aware, that has given rise to no particular difficulty, because again one is not dealing with great matters of day-to-day policy. One is dealing with the setting up of the administration and so on, and the actual working of the valuation arrangements is an independent matter for the assessor fulfilling his statutory obligations. All I can say to the right hon. Gentleman is that, given that there is this difficulty about representation, I shall look at the matter again to see whether we can get an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were doing this on a population and valuation basis and trying to get equality, one ought to step up the Western Isles representation from one to two because in terms of population and valuation it is about double that of Orkney and Shetland. I am not sure that Shetland would welcome that arrangement, but it would give equality. The difficulty is that the Highland region is opposed to that, and would wish to have a much bigger majority on this committee. There is a real problem here. I do not think that it is a point of tremendous principle, but the authorities may feel that it is a matter of considerable significance, and I should want to see whether we could solve this particular problem. If this order is allowed to go forward—and, in fact, it has already become operative—I shall look at this particular point and I give an undertaking to the right hon. Gentleman that I shall consider the other points still worrying Shetland, and now Orkney as well, to see whether we can come to a solution which is acceptable to all parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>10.57 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a major point of principle which worries me if the order should be approved. Why is it that the Scottish Office would appear to have been the prime mover in this matter? The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 was passed. It was much discussed both inside and outside the House, and I heard some of the discussions that took place. We were given to understand that one of the objectives of that Act was to make local government more responsible with greater authority for carrying out its proper functions. One of its functions is to deal with rating and valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, within a year of the introduction of that Act to try to make local authorities more responsible, to have more control over their own affairs and to act altogether in a responsible way, why do we find Big Brother coming in and introducing an order which apparently does not have the universal approval of the authorities directly involved? One authority, we are told, is positively against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be a very good idea for authorities to combine for these purposes, but I should have thought that if they were to combine for these purposes it is a function entirely within the responsibility of the authorities. It may be necessary for an order to be brought forward, though I am not sure about that, but it seems to me that it should only be brought forward by the Secretary of State if the local authorities have come to him saying that they request and require the order. It is not for the Secretary of State to say to the local authorities that he has a good idea about how their business should be run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very concerned about this, and I feel that it is a matter of considerable principle. We should not be allowing—certainly we should not be encouraging —St. Andrew's House to continue the old pastime of suggesting to local authorities how they should conduct their business. It is not entirely the fault of St. Andrew's House. Sometimes it would be helpful to provide advice, but it should not keep telling them how to run their business. Until a major effort is made at St. Andrew's House to keep its finger out of the local authorities, there will never be a consequential responsibility among the local authorities to carry out the functions

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
which they are by Act of Parliament required to perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any dissatisfaction among the local authorities with this order, if they are not agreed about the way in which it should run and if they have different ideas, then I suggest that the order should not be approved. We should wait to know what the local authorities are going to do, or not going to do, about the matter. Each authority has at present a statutory duty as regards rating and valuation, and must carry out that duty. But whether the authorities do it expen- sively for the ratepayers or efficiently and cheaply is their business. It is undesirable that orders like this should come forward which, apparently, did not emanate initially from a request and a requirement from the local authorities concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed at the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson), because he has just said that the Scottish Office should not inter- fere with what local authorities do. I remind him that his own Government interfered continually with what local authorities did, particularly, for example, in the rents charged for council houses. They continually intervened in all sorts of ways, and it is right that they should. Local authorities have no powers other than the powers that Parliament gives them. Parliament has always retained the right to take away these powers if it thinks they are being used badly. So there is a perfectly good and logical reason for this set-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to what the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) said. He said that people in Shetland were a bit frightened that valuations of Inverness standard might be applied to Shetland. I suggest that if the development of oil discoveries con- tinues off the coast of Shetland, judging by what has happened up to now, the valuations in Shetland may be far higher than the valuations in Inverness—and rightly so. These valuations are based, for example, in valuing certain types of business, on turnover, and take into account the amenities of an area and various other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is needed here is what I have suggested all along, because the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
valuation system is crazy. The system of rating, of measuring the number of square feet and a certain amenity value which is guessed at in the first place, is a shocking waste of time, labour, money and everything else. The right hen. Gentleman said that there could be only one rating authority for the whole of Scotland, but I say that there need not be any rating authority for the whole of Scotland, because this system is absolutely crazy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have a modern system. We ought to get, not the 80 or 90 per cent. that Orkney and Shetland get now, but the whole money for running local authorities from the Government. After all, the Government hand out the power to local authorities saying what they can do and what they cannot do. Why should they not also hand out the money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is getting a bit wide. He must bring back his remarks to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must raise one valid point. The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East said that there should be separate rating authorities because they are in part separate local authority units.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not what I said. I said that these authorities have a statutory duty. If they wish to combine, it is their business and not the business of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that it is not their business. It is not their business at all. The Government decided in the first place what they should and should not do, and the Government have a right to change that in the light of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This set-up was only created in order to pacify these sparsely populated vast areas about which we have been told, because they wanted some degree of close contact. Otherwise there is no justification for them at all. None of them should have been regional authorities in the first place. This was argued throughout the proceedings on the Local Government (Scotland) Act. I do not recollect the hon. Gentleman's party arguing this, but now his party uses it as an excuse for opposing an order of this kind. It is a bit far-fetched to worry about the set-up and any abuse of the set-up. It would not make a great deal of difference whether another one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
was added to the Western Isles representation in order to equalise the position, or whether one was deducted from the Highland region. They are deciding how much money will be spent to administer this archaic system; how many assessors will be necessary; how many officers will be necessary. That is all they are doing. I see no reason why anyone should object to the order, and it would make very little difference to modify it either one way or another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend replies, could he tell us what the existing system is regarding valuation organisation in those areas? Under the present system only the counties appoint assessors. Large burghs, no matter how large they are, have to accept the assessor. Virtually he will have a requisition order for the cost of the assessors in the county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.6 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Hunter) there is a combination at the moment between Orkney, Shetland, Caithness and Sutherland. The assessor, I understand, is located at Wick. I am not sure whether there are professional assessors on Orkney and Shetland, but the office is based at Wick. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) said, one is talking here not about a policy committee determining valuations, but a committee with the remit to see that the administration of the assessor is properly established, appointments made and the officers provided with premises. By itself this has no influence on the valuations, or the principle of valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not get into the wider questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West who, before we came here this morning, said that he had no intention of participating in the debate. But I knew that as soon as the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) had started to speak, I should have a speech from my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
for Dundee, West. I shall not go into the wider questions of valuation and rating because we are looking into the wider issue of local government finance in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I should say to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Dumbartonshire, East that the provision for what we are doing here was made in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, for the specific reason that in local government reform we did not produce what was ultimately a completely tidy system. Special arrangements were made for the Highlands authorities which, on grounds of population, would not be independent authorities but whose special problems of remoteness, distance and sparseness of population were recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in recognising that—and we did similar things in other parts of the country as well—special provisions were written into the Act to provide for particular services. For example, in the Strathclyde region there are spf.cial provisions, looked at from the opposite point of view, of a large population over a wide distance, for education and social work. There are special provisions in other parts of the country so far as planning is concerned. There was absolutely nothing in this provision which was in principle different from what had been done in regard to other services in other parts of the country. This provision was not a matter of controversy while the Local Government Bill was going through. I think I have already said all I need on the other substantial point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
