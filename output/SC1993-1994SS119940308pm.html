	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Before we adjourned for lunch, you rebuked me sternly for using the term Stalinist when referring to some of the attitudes of Opposition Members. When the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) used that term on the Floor of the House, Madam Speaker did not rebuke him. Why is it acceptable on the Floor of the House, but not in Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very simple. I am always pleased to help the hon. Gentleman. He made that statement from a sedentary position and I informed him that there were no Stalinists on the Committee. The hon. Gentleman was rebuked not because he made the comment in a speech, but because he made it from a sedentary position. He has a habit of raising matters from a sedentary position, which is against the rules of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. It may surprise you, but I commend you for your comments. We were all distressed that we could hardly hear my hon. Friend the Minister because of sedentary interruptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should refer to a speech this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) who mentioned the letter from COSLA which makes clear that COSLA does not wish to be dissociated from the majority of representations that local authorities made. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Convention is content to stand upon the views expressed by its member authorities in relation to the existing statutory requirements to have education and social work committees."</p></blockquote>
Its final paragraph goes further and states that COSLA
	<br><blockquote><p>"favours the removal of the statutory requirements to appoint representatives of the church and teaching professions."</p></blockquote>
That goes further than the Government as we propose to keep church representatives on the committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that in its letter of 4 March COSLA did not dissociate itself from our proposals to remove the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
statutory requirements and, in taking that line, it reflects the views expressed by its members. COSLA also favours the removal of the requirement to appoint church and teaching professionals. We agree about the teacher representatives, but the committees will be free to co-opt teachers in future if they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government are removing the requirement to appoint representatives from the teaching profession, why do not they also remove chinch representatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are historic reasons for the church representatives serving an important and useful function, but we do not wish to go into that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already replied to the hon. Gentleman on the matter. This morning he condemned us for removing church representatives from committees when we are doing nothing of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. If the Minister had listened, he would have realised that we merely quoted from the COSLA letter and asked him to respond. We did not say that the Government had put that in the Bill or raised it in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that. The point is covered in clause 31(4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: 
	<i>Hansard</i> will, of course, record the facts, but the comments of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) suggest that he has read the Bill in the period between our sitting this morning and this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman sought to clarify his remarks and I am content to let the matter rest there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the premise that small education authorities cannot deliver the duties laid on them by legislation. This is well precedented: the two education authorities in Scotland with the lowest school running costs per pupil are Borders—the smallest mainland education authority, which performs an extremely effective function—whose costs are £2,485 per pupil and Fife, whose costs are £2,488 per pupil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Minister admit that Borders region relies on Lothian region education department for many specialist services? That is the problem. We need the larger authorities for a range of specialised services, including special education and psychological service provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support joint arrangements and co-operation between local authorities. Such co-operation exists with regard to special educational needs, and it will continue in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
On small authorities, the authorities sending most pupils on to higher education were the Western Isles with 35 per cent., Borders with 30 per cent., Highland with 29 per cent., Dumfries and Galloway with 28 per cent. and Fife with 28 per cent. That is a record of success and I see no reason to endorse the attacks that have been made on small authorities. They are perfectly capable of delivering an extremely high standard of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly that the Borders provides an effective level of service. I think that the point of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley about joint services is also right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister, at some time during the debate, address a point that I, in my inadequate way, raised this morning I refer to the consequences for the urban centres left in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee districts. The cost of education per child in inner-city areas is higher. Therefore, if the resources spread to the suburban areas, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to sustain the quality of education in inner-city centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, of course, is a different point I accept that it may be more expensive to provide education in the new councils, including those covered by Strathclyde region, for example. However, a number of authorities in Strathclyde have made it clear that they could make savings on this service if they became single-tier councils. The decision will ultimately be for the new councils themselves. As I said earlier, although there may be additional costs in a few areas, it is clear that the reorganistion over Scotland as a whole will result in significant savings across all services, and education must be considered in the context of all services. That will more than offset any additional education costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any change in the balance of expenditure between services and councils will, I have no doubt, be taken into account when decisions are ultimately taken on the distribution of finance among the new authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister dispute the figures for administration costs per head of the pupil population, which were given to me by Frank Pignatelli? Those costs are £23.14 for the Borders, £18.93 for Central, £24.95 for Dumfries and Galloway, £24.86 for Fife, £16.82 for Grampian, £26.26 for Lothian, £6.45 for Tayside and £10.08 for Strathclyde. As for the islands, the costs are £39.09 for Orkney, £8.92 for Shetland and £63.27 for Western Isles. Are those figures factually disputed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to check the hon. Gentleman's figures individually. I have no reason to suppose that he is giving incorrect figures, but I shall check them and let him know in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to conclude my remarks by saying—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) will have plenty of opportunity to come back about this in his own speech if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant-aided expenditure assessment will take into account the costs of nursery, primary and secondary school teachers, non-teaching staff, property and special school teachers. The methodology is agreed with COSLA in the distribution committee of the working party on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>931</span>
local government finance. The Scottish Office, in calculating the grant-aided expenditure for the education sub-services will have to discuss that item with COSLA in due course in the distribution committee, as is the usual procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress again that the hon. Member for Fife, Central seems to be confusing the appointment of a director with the duties incumbent on authorities. The duties are already covered by statute. They are delivered by the local authorities and are independent of the requirement to have a director of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there have to be discussions with COSLA. Who will those discussions be with? Will they be with the COSLA education committee? If so, the adult thing to do would be to ask its members what they think about statutory directors of education. There may be all the difference in the world between the generality of COSLA and what Mr. Black has said. The COSLA education committee is at the sharp end; it has to deal with the situation on a day-to-day basis and, to be blunt, knows something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is the distribution committee of the working party on local government finance. That is a regular procedure which will continue to be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) said that children's legislation had not been brought forward. I can confirm that the Government will introduce measures to fulfil the commitments outlined in the White Paper, "Scotland's Children". The issue is not being neglected, and we are glad that the proposals have gained wide support. Measures will be introduced as soon as the opportunity presents itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the information he has given. When do the Government plan to present the legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have made my next point in an intervention this morning if the Minister had given way. The whole thrust of his argument appears to be that he should not impose prescribed practices on local government. Can the Minister, who has been driven by a Bill that makes all sorts of conditions for local authorities and who has issued more statutory instruments and guidelines than have hitherto been known, answer this simple question? Why does he disagree with prescription when it comes to our amendment, yet propose to put a duty on local authorities to participate in compulsory competitive tendering? What is that if not prescription?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's district council fundamentally disagrees with him. Representations from Renfrew have said that it is also considered that the statutory requirement for the service post of director of education and director of social work should be discontinued. That would allow the new unitary councils the freedom to appoint the best person for the job and to develop the most appropriate departmental and committee structures to manage the full range of council services. As for children's legislation, we will introduce measures as soon as we are in a position to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working party that looked into these matters included in its membership representatives of COSLA,
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland, the Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland and Professor Alan Alexander, chairman of the Scottish Local Authorities Management Centre. We were heavily influenced by the weight of the representations received, with 68 per cent. of the local authorities favouring the repeal. As I have said, we would have no objection to any or all of the new authorities establishing a committee whose sole purpose would relate to education, if that is what the authority so wished, but we believe in the principle of maximum flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) will no doubt speak to amendment No. 346, which is in his name. Together with amendment No 198, it would reinstate the requirement that an education authority must appoint a director of education. If I understand amendment No. 346 correctly, it would reverse a proposed technical repeal necessitated by the move to a single-tier local government structure. I suspect that that is simply an oversight by the hon. Member for Angus, East, but we would oppose both amendments in any case. I look forward to hearing what the hon. Gentleman has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that this is a matter on which prescription—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked me to reply to him on a point and I shall certainly do so. I stress that the existing statute does not require the director to have any teaching or other professional qualifications. Therefore, many of the hon. Gentleman's criticisms are directed against the existing statute. It is no use for the Opposition to say that they want to retain the status quo. The legislative requirements that they want are extra and would have to be inserted into the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the Opposition's concern. Our proposals are to tidy up what already exists. There is nothing now that prevents an authority from employing a non-specialist as a director and, in future, there will be nothing to prevent an authority from employing a specialist. It will be up to the authority involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he does not share our concerns about the threat to children and older people, the most vulnerable in our community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's question is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of current statutory duties. I will make a point of writing to the hon. Gentleman tomorrow to set out those statutory duties so that in future, he will no longer have the opportunity to ask questions from a position of total ignorance. The duties exist and I shall inform the hon. Gentleman of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister had better consider his remarks when considering these issues. I do not mind when he abuses the Opposition or abuses me, but he has put on record that he does not share our concerns about the future of children, older people and people with special needs. That is the issue. Is the Minister willing to say that he has concerns and that he will attempt to allay our fears?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

On amendments Nos. 245 and 246, schedule 14 currently provides for the repeal of section 126 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. That has the effect of removing the dispensation given in that section which enables teachers to be appointed to education committees. As hon. Members will appreciate, our intention has always been that teachers should no longer have an automatic right to sit on committees dealing with education. We wish to give committees the maximum discretion in determining their internal management structures, but it has never been our intention that teachers should be disqualified from membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 245 would therefore allow teachers to be appointed to such committees in line with what has always been our policy. Of course, the opportunity to co-opt can be taken. Half of an education committee can consist of co-opted members if that is the committee's wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to ask the Minister clearly and unequivocally to say that he thinks that it is a positive thing for one of the authorities, of whatever size, to appoint a non-professional person—not an education or social work professional—to a director's position should the authority have such a post. It is important that we know where the Minister stands. Does he support a professional being in charge of the service should the authority choose to have a director or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of principle, that issue is for the authorities concerned. If I were a councillor I would vote for the best man. I was on the policy and resources committee and had to help to choose a new chief executive for Edinburgh. The relevant qualifications weighed heavily with me. The local councillors concerned should be free to exercise their judgment and discretion.

Is he not aware of the damage that that can do to professions such as education and social work in which professional qualifications mean expertise and depth of knowledge, which are so important to those services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend again attempt to get through to Labour Members that what the Opposition suggest in respect of directors of education and their qualifications is the status quo? The system that they are arguing for already allows a committee to select a director of education without the qualifications that they are trying to build into the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. The provision states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The education authority shall employ a director of education who shall be the chief education officer and shall hold office on such reasonable terms and conditions as the authority appointing him think fit"</p></blockquote>
As I said, amendment No. 246 is a consequential amendment to reverse the repeal by schedule 14 of section 126. The changes that we are making do not weaken the education service, but strengthen local government by giving authorities the power to act in the best manner for their areas. It is against such a background that we oppose the Opposition's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the current system education committees employ people with the appropriate qualifications. They have to employ someone in the post of director of education. Does the Minister foresee education committees not appointing a director of education under his system? He is giving them the power not to appoint if they so wish. The Government want that power in England; why is not it retained in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I envisage that authorities will employ the best person for the job. In the vast majority of cases that will no doubt be a director of education who is highly qualified. The decision should be for the education committee to make when all the circumstances have been taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more that I hear the more disturbed I become. The Minister is ducking the fact that under the Government's plan an authority may not appoint a director of education. It will have the power to not appoint an education committee. That is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of the debate has been obscured, but our discussion is extremely important to the future of Scottish education. In the short term there will be no change because education committees and directors of education will be appointed. The Minister is allowing, however, for the possibility of no directors of education and no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
education committees being appointed in the medium and long terms. There may be various combinations of committees covering education plus other local authority services. That goes against the traditions of the Scottish education system, a national system in which education was always given pride of place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have always been fully qualified professionals in charge of the system, offering the best service to the population. If the clause is accepted, it will be against the education traditions in Scotland and against the wishes of parents and the education profession. It will be an amazing mistake and will downgrade education. Education is the largest service and employer in local government. It takes up almost half the local government budget. It deserves its own committee. It should be considered on its merits and treated with the respect that it deserves. The Minister suggested that education could be put together with parks and leisure, or recreation. That is not flexibility. It is stupidity. Which qualification would count, education or parks and leisure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Orkney director of education is also responsible for leisure and recreation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that what is good for Orkney and Shetland may not be good for other parts of Scotland. I agree, but that is the whole point of my hon. Friend the Minister's argument. Flexibility means that places such as Orkney and Shetland, and other areas in Scotland, can choose what is right for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is called flexibility is also called a failure in quality and standards. The Minister cannot guarantee quality, or that the standards of a fully qualified director of education in the traditional Scottish sense will be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have known some superb directors of leisure and recreation, but I would not let them loose on the school system. Equally, I have known some good directors of education, but their training and background did not render them fit to run parks and recreation. Combining the two functions will lessen the importance of education, which is crucial to the Scottish economy, to the future of our youngsters and to the families in all our communities. Education should be given the respect that it deserves. The Minister is making a mistake in downgrading education in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some rare combinations might result. If there is to be a director of education, parks and recreation, I presume that the ideal candidate will be a B.Ed who happened to be president of the student union. That would be incredible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must change his mind and allow education the priority that it has always enjoyed in Scotland. It has been and must remain a national priority. A fully trained, professional education service should be available to all Scots children, irrespective of background. It should allow all children to develop to their full potential. It should be available as a national system delivered locally. Education will remain the biggest local
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>
government service after the changes go through. The traditional Scottish way has been to provide a national system for all our children, run to the highest standards by fully qualified professional people who understand that education is a national priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish approach is the opposite of the fragmented English system. It is one of Scotland's strengths and must remain so. In introducing the measure the Government are weakening education and giving it a lower priority in the community. It is precisely because Scotland has always made education a priority and organised it on a professional and qualified basis that there should be a statutory education committee and a statutory director of education, as a clear sign and product of that longstanding national commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are giving all that up in the name of flexibility and, apparently, allowing choice to local authorities. If we have to give up flexibility to make education a priority, I would be happy to do so. Education should be a priority and the Minister's so-called flexibility is a total illusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new councils want to add items, such as sports, to the remit of their education committees, they can do so, but they should retain the statutory requirement for a committee and for a director of education. That would be a portent and a sign that education is and will remain a priority, as it should be in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I taught in a Scottish school and I went through the Scottish education system and I am bothered by the Government's attitude to the system. With the exception of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), Ministers in the Scottish Office have no experience of the Scottish national system of education. That appears to be one of the problems in their attitude to the Bill. The Secretary of State did not attend a normal state school like those attended by other children in Scotland. I doubt whether the Minister who addressed the Committee, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) was a fellow scholar of mine at Govan high school. Ministers' collective experience of education is abnormal for Scotland, and so is the abolition of the statutory educational posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a hidden agenda exists. I am beginning to wonder. A Government who believe in opting out and adopting the English model, by which schools are encouraged to leave the state system, see no need for statutory education committees. Their future abolition would require legislation, but if they are kept out of the Bill they can just disappear, if that is what the Government have in mind. That goes against what the Scottish people wish. I am concerned about a hidden agenda behind the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim to have consulted about the issue, but they have made no attempt to consult schools or school boards. I am told that the Scottish School Board Association had to ask the Government for a copy of the consultation document—it had to go out of its way to obtain it. Had parents and schools been consulted, there would have been massive support for the retention of statutory educational provision. With regard to issues such as dismissal of teachers, catchment areas and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>937</span>
provision for special educational needs, a fusion of democratic and professional input is necessary. That, traditionally, has been ably provided by education committees. That important component of Scottish educational provision should not be left to chance or to local whim. It should exist as of right, clearly seen to be part of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have retained statutory directors of education in England, why have they now gone against Scottish practice and consumer demand in this way? The need for a statutory committee is proven, to my mind, by the fact that the entire new system will be under attack financially and in relation to service provision. The Government have stated that there will be no new money, but we know that the transition costs will be massive. They will have to be met from somewhere—and that can only be from service provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke earlier about ensuring that the money would remain for education. He said that statutory obligations would remain and he seemed to be telling us that the cash would be available. Is he really saying that educational finance would be ring-fenced? I should love to hear him say that, but I do not think that that is what he means. He means that in the normal finance negotiations, using the scatter-gun approach, the Government will give extra weighting here and there. That will come nowhere near meeting the needs of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that Scots authorities will have to wrestle with massive problems such as the maintenance of the quality of services, I am very concerned about the financial aspect of the measure. There is huge potential for difficulties to arise from the slicing apart of school catchment areas by arbitrary central Government boundary maps. School closure is threatened as a result of the changes. I have not heard the Minister say a word about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new authorities will by definition have to cope with providing for special educational needs from smaller resource bases. I have not heard the Minister deal with that problem. The new authorities will decide the fate of the non-mandatory sectors, which we take for granted, but which are threatened by the Government's change proposals. What assurances can the Government provide about the continuity of nursery and pre-school education? Many problems exist, but no new money will be given to tackle them. Resources will be drained because money will be lost in transitional and other costs. Services will suffer in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under those strained circumstances, it is crucial that the professional expertise of directors of education and the democratic input of a committee that reflects local needs and opinions are available in law. The Government produce a recipe for chaotic service provision; they run away from providing in law a local mechanism to cope with their decisions. The Government's burdens on Scotland's education system add to their witches' brew of rushed, ill-thought-out, underfunded reorganisation. Scottish education has absorbed 24 major Government initiatives since 1987. At a time of great uncertainty, imposed by central Government's reorganisation, education will have to cope with the Howie changes. The Government do not slacken the pace of the enforced changes, they add to the burden when the system is weakest—in the throes of reorganisation. What are the
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
Government playing at? At a difficult time, they magnify the problems that they have created by forcing teachers to bear an extra work load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore support the retention of statutory education committees and directors of education. We should ensure that the time-tested and sure statutory mechanism of the current education system is maintained. I fear that my pleas will fall on deaf ears. The abolution of mechanisms that have served Scottish education well are another Government mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the unemployment and large-scale poverty in our country, social services meet fundamental Scottish needs. The present system should be retained for reasons that I have already given when considering education. Social services and education are essential to meeting the needs of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The illusion of flexibility and choice is no substitute for the guaranteed reality of statutory education committees and directors of education. The Minister offers flexibility; I believe that his offer is a mirage. He cannot guarantee quality. In the short term, the new councils will maintain current practices, but there is no guarantee that they will do that in future. Education will become just another service. It will be combined with all sorts of other services. Education deserves better. It is vital to Scotland. It is part of our tradition. The Government make a big mistake by pushing the changes through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no difficulty accepting the simple principle that properly qualified individuals should be employed as directors of education and social work. I could also support a statutory requirement for such posts. However, such statutory provisions would require the Committee and the House to consider many other aspects. We would have to reach an agreed position on such matters as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>939</span>
fixed-term contracts. When we put a measure into statute, it is important to give the new councillors, who will be faced with the task of making it work, the opportunity to review what may have been a mistaken decision made early in their term of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to have a statutory provision, we should have a statutory requirement for short-term, fixed contracts, such as those of most executive directors in the wealth-generating part of our economy. Executive directors usually have three or four-year contracts: five-years is the maximum length that I know of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider what sort of councils we want. They should be enabling rather than providing councils. If we include in the statute a provision that individuals must hold a post with an established council, we must consider the possibility of empire building. That happens everywhere, even in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does not the hon. Gentleman wait until I have elaborated my views? It may surprise him to know that I have never believed in simple dogma. We should consider what exists now, what we are trying to achieve through legislation, and what our objectives are. What is the Committee attempting to do? First, we have to study the Government's proposals. Secondly, we have to study a fairly long list of amendments. Amendment No. 149 deals with social work. I asked earlier how much detail we should go into. It is important that, when we consider the amendments upon which we shall vote, we are clear in our minds what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can local authorities be enabling authorities? We already have in statute provisions enabling schools to become self governing. That does not take those schools into the private sector quite the reverse. It gives local communities and local people the opportunity to make local decisions funded by the taxpayer. That is what I am talking about in its simplest form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a school is substantially self-governing, it needs a professionally qualified director who can advise the local council on matters affecting its statutory position. That is important, and it is why I asked whether there was any redress if the council fails to meet that statutory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a question of the running of schools, we must also be clear about the statutory requirements to cater for special needs. Children with special needs require special attention. In addition to self-governing schools, an apparatus is required to provide such special attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go down that route, I must be satisfied that all the building blocks are in place: I am not satisfied that they are.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be unrealistic to say that that is my view, and I have held it for many years.

Whether senior officers have fixed-term contracts goes beyond the question of whether there should be a director of education. I understand the point about the need for a director of education, but this is the wrong amendment on which to tack the question of whether the provision should apply to the chief executive or the chief legal officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am putting on record that we should examine this issue in much greater detail. It is a matter of principle and of practice and we must not confuse those two aspects or try to make ground in one respect at the expense of the other.

He spoke earlier about the legal responsibilities being looked after by someone who knew the statutory duties. He did not, however, mention standards—perhaps because of the track he was following. Does the hon.

Does the hon.

I am sometimes accused of seeing things in a simple way, but my experience of life has taught me that it is important not to devalue the standards set by others merely because one does not fully understand them. It is important that the Committee does not brush standards aside in looking for sound bites. It makes sense to merge social work and housing. That would require the director of social work to be in charge. That would be logical because housing is a social need. I have never understood why Parliament divided those two responsibilities between authorities. One reason why I am keen to have unitary authorities is to bring together housing and social work, for example, so that Scotland can have a system in which the authority can meet the needs of the people under one roof.

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification. If I heard my hon. Friend correctly, he said that, because of statutory duties, the director of education could have authority for both those functions; he did not say a statutory director of education. I assume that my hon. Friend will confirm that he does not see it as a statutory necessity that there is a director of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that there may be no doubt on either side of the Committee, I should explain that if we were discussing in detail a provision in this or any other Bill that proposed authorities as enablers rather than providers, the councils would have fewer employees and there would not be huge wages bills that could not be cut at a given time. There is no flexibility. I have employed many thousands of people and I assure the Committee that every employer looks for flexibility, especially when there are long summer holidays. Consideration of that issue is long overdue. A local authority should be an enabler rather than a provider of facilities. The Bill will not achieve that aim but I want to put it on the record that I am not opposed to the amendments for doctrinaire reasons. I am concerned that the Committee is not considering the Bill's ultimate effects. I accept that when the Bill is enacted there will be single, all-purpose authorities but we will not have moved away from the previous empire building. I am not saying anything nasty about individuals or about how people work within those empires, but when a body is given statutory powers it grows and grows until those powers are removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not mean to slight people who work in local government—quite the reverse. I have tremendous regard for those people, many of whom assist me and my association, and I would not want to upset them. However, they work in inflexible structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has been useful. I have wrestled with the problems of such structures for a number of years. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is saying that we may end up with enabling authorities, which the Opposition think would be dangerous, but which the hon. Gentleman wants, but that those enabling authorities should have professionally qualified chief officers of their education and social work departments. The statutory provisions and standards set down by the Government should be carried through that individual and delivered by an enabler or a provider—depending on how one looks at it—at local authority level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way that that can be achieved is through amendment No. 185, which would ensure that there is such a person. The Government must bring forward an amendment, which I believe that the hon. Gentleman is indicating that he would support, to limit that person's term of appointment in some way. That would allow the position to be reviewed and prevent the empire building that he has described. How would the hon. Gentleman achieve what he wants without accepting the amendment? It would be helpful if he would indicate that the Government will take the proposal on board and return with their own amendment if the Opposition withdraw this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks a fair question. I have learnt from bitter experience of Committees and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
the way in which legislation progresses through the House that one should not vote for something just because one hopes to be able to implement it. Anyone who studies legislation knows that Bills become Acts only for us to find that the side-effects are not what we expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I happened to agree with the community charge. I do not apologise for that and will not be diverted down that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that my hon. Friend the Minister would have allowed me to speak before, but I look forward to his reply to the debate. It is possible to provide good services while at the same time introducing legislation that institutes enabling authorities, introduces fixed-term contracts for people in senior positions and achieves greater flexibility in employment and so on. I mentioned self-governing schools, but we could move more quickly if there were greater provision of private nursing homes, health care for needy individuals and social work provision. However, that can only be done if—to use a Labour phrase—composite amendments are tabled. If those amendments were to embrace all the things that I want, I would have no difficulty in supporting the notion of a statutory requirement, but if those safeguards are not forthcoming I should feel that I was giving a blank cheque to people who want to continue empire building as they have in the past. That would defeat everything that I believe in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not wish to detain the Committee, but the matter is too important for the sound bite nonsense of mutual attacks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one would describe the hon. Member for Tayside, North as a sound bite, but his contribution was helpful. He appeared to say that he agrees with the principle that there should be properly qualified directors of education and of social work, but that he was worried about the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a problem that we in Opposition often have to face. The best way to get the Government to accept principles is to compel them to accept technically defective amendments in Committee so that they can introduce technically correct amendments on Report. However, the analogy between providing the crucial services that we are discussing and teaching someone how to fly is a good one. One would not be taught to fly by someone who is not properly qualified. Similarly, no one who is not qualified should be in charge of education or of the provision of social work to vulnerable citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go further, and extend the analogy to the present direct provision by authorities of the services that have been described. We want them to continue that provision, but the role of a qualified person becomes even more important if we get to the contracted-out scenario. If these absolutely crucial services are contracted out—I accept that the Minister thinks that there is a case for that—it is even more important that a regulating official be directly employed by the local authority to ensure that private contractors maintain the highest possible standards of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister came to Committee today displaying his usual disarming innocence. I was not entirely disarmed. It is a happy coincidence that 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> published a
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
half-term report on his performance as the Scottish Office Minister responsible for education under the heading "Could do better". I shall not quote at length, but I cannot resist the final words, under the heading "General comments":
	<br><blockquote><p>"James is a nice lad, who works hard and listens carefully to the advice of the St Andrew's House Academy learning support staff. But teachers and parents are very unhappy with this term's work on council reform. Perhaps he has been hanging around with the wrong crowd—especially that Stewart boy with the whiskers."</p></blockquote>
The Minister gets a C minus on the same day that the Tory party gets 13 per cent. in the opinion polls in Scotland.

What is important is provision for children in primary and secondary schools whom we represent. I am a parent of children at a state school in Scotland. I have a personal commitment to not only my own family but all my constituents, who depend on the six high schools and 30 primary schools provided by Lothian regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council's education department provides absolutely excellent, unparalleled services in our part of Scotland. They cover primary and secondary education, special and community education and, most important, pre-school provision across the board. Lothian is second to none in Scotland. Those services are vital. Ideally, we wish to provide even better services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was most disappointed when the Minister wrote to me last week, refusing to meet me to discuss a capital allocation inadequate to enable Lothian regional council to maintain primary and secondary school buildings throughout the region. I recently visited north Berwick high school, not far from his home, and was dismayed by the standard of some of the buildings. Yesterday, the Scottish Office announced a standstill budget for capital allocation, which will make it impossible for our local education authority to make progress. I feel passionately that there must be high standards in education and social work. That requires properly qualified and designated officials and committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends spoke of the problems likely to affect smaller, new local authorities. I share their concern. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>945</span>
greatly relieved that my constituents in East Lothian have been spared the fate of having the smallest mainland authority in Scotland. When we began debating the Bill, schedule 1 related to Berwickshire and East Lothian local authority, which would have had a population of just 75,000 people, and only six secondary schools—two of which are very small. It could not possibly have delivered a full range of education and social work services directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was limited scope to provide for pupils' needs and limited prospects for teachers and other staff in those departments. I am delighted that that has been disposed of in Committee. The Bill is still a dog's breakfast and includes several small local authorities. This debate is about the creation of a loophole that might lead to local authorities having no education or social work committees and no properly qualified and designated director of education or of social work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning there was a debate about who said what in which COSLA committee. I make no bones about the fact that I disagree with COSLA's conclusions. We are perfectly entitled to hold such a view. We have a duty to consider the issues before us, in the light of the many things that have been said. I was sent a letter by Dr. Badger, the director of Dunbar grammar school board. He formally asked me to support the amendments and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was noted that the proposals included the removal of the statutory obligation for local authorities to have … a chief education officer, an education committee, teacher representatives on the education committee. The school board were unanimously opposed to these proposals and to the fact that once again Scotland is to be treated differently from England and Wales. It was felt that these proposals if enacted would inevitably reduce the status of education in the workings of local government to an unacceptable level."</p></blockquote>
That legitimate fear was expressed by a school board duly elected to serve in the Dunbar area of my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Scottish education system is different from that in England and Wales? The director of that school board is hardly making a new point Scotland takes great pride in being treated differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a pretty disingenuous comment, even for the hon. Member for Ayr. We have a separate and better education system in Scotland, but we are debating the undermining and removal of a safeguard in our country, which will continue to apply in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opinion expressed by Dr. Badger has been repeated many times by people involved in Scottish education. Ann Hill, the president of the Scottish School Board Association, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to downgrade the education system in this way amounts to little more than a betrayal of our children and is totally against the wishes of parents."</p></blockquote>
The Church of Scotland Education Committee was quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government reforms would bring a downgrading of the distinctiveness of Scotland's unique education system and put at risk the strategic planning necessary to deliver … adequate provision … for those who have special education needs."</p></blockquote>
Archbishop Thomas Winning, the president of the Catholic Education Commission of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposals for new local authorities are ill considered and likely to cause considerable anxiety and hardship".</p></blockquote>
Finally, 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> reported that Kenneth Corsar, president of the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland,
	<br><blockquote><p>"emphasised that those in greatest need were most likely to suffer from the proposals. The new councils would not be able to devote the present level of resources to the fight against poverty and disadvantage."</p></blockquote>
Those concerns have been expressed right across the board by people who know what they are talking about in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision on whether an authority has committees or directors of social work and education is permissive rather than prescriptive. The Minister has made that point already. The decision results in an amendment to the law and we are entitled to explore the connection between those changes and the Government's thrust towards schools opting out of the local authority system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to hear whether the new ability of local authorities to water down existing safeguards may be connected with opting out in the future. We are hostile to local authorities opting out of control of education and we know that our constituents are too. It is not remotely surprising to the majority of people in Scotland that, despite all the efforts and blandishments of the Scottish Office, only one school in Scotland has so far opted out of local authority control. It is Dornoch academy, to which special considerations apply. Parents in Scotland do not want opting out but to maintain local authority control and high standards. They are right to tell us that they expect the safeguards to be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children and the vulnerable citizens who are clients of social work departments are far too important for dogma. They should be covered by a statutory framework that clearly establishes who is responsible for what This morning we discussed the imposition by Parliament of a whole range of duties on local authorities in education and social work. In deciding to impose duties, Parliament should provide for the means to achieve the ends—resources, a responsible framework, the right structure and the requirement that officials should be properly qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a serious mistake if the Committee allowed for the diminution of safeguards that the Bill proposes. I have not been impressed by the Minister's defence of that I hope that the Committee, including the hon. Member for Tayside, North, will accept the case for maintaining those important safeguards for children and social work clients in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some parts of the debate have been interesting, and I hope that we find some common ground. I do not know whether the Minister was listening to his hon. Friends, but I get the impression from some of his responses this morning that he was not listening to points made by Labour Members. He kept repeating himself in a way that did not show any learning curve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our simple argument against the Government's proposals for education and education authorities is that if they are not broken, why fix them? The education system has been delivering better services, regardless of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>947</span>
the mud that has been thrown from time to time by the Government's supporters. Since 1974, Scottish education has been improving—Scottish Office statisticians confirm that. We know that there are problems of peaks and troughs and of areas where deprivation is so profound that the education system is asked to act as a lever to lift people from circumstances into which no Government should allow them to fall. The system fails when local authorities cannot find the extra resources for such social engineering. The position would have been helped if the Government had taken the courageous step of making nursery and pre-school education a statutory responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I try to go back to first principles. It is important not to get into sound-bite analysis or the sort of yahboo politics that we heard this morning with the use of spurious and dubious quotes, misquotes and misinterpretations.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the problem when one gets away from an objective analysis. Such an analysis means that people who read the debates see that we have differences of opinion about objective facts rather than indulging in the yah-boo politics that I find totally unhelpful when considering a serious matter.

I find that it is important to go back to Wheatley, not just to the briefs that the Whips or the researchers in the Conservative party handed out, but to the documentation itself. Yesterday evening, I spent a number of hours, which were actually pleasurable, reading the Wheatley submissions on education and also the Standing Committee reports. It is strange what gives some people pleasure. The Minister sometimes finds it difficult to concentrate on his brief. He may derive pleasure from reading the deliberations of a commission that was very important in Scotland up to 1969. The Minister may borrow my copy at the end of our proceedings and read it tonight if he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remarked on the Minister's stalled approach to reading his brief when compared with the Minister responsible for education, who reads his brief with clarity if not emotion. Everything is done by his civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>948</span>
It is important to examine what personal social services were considered to be. Paragraph 314 in chapter 11 of the Wheatley report talks about a service that renders,
	<br><blockquote><p>"face-to-face confrontation between 'client' and skilled worker—whether in the classroom, the clinic, or the home. In each case, therefore, it is necessary to employ a main task force of 'field workers', most of whom must have professional qualifications."</p></blockquote>
That is just the basic personal social service. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Again, in all the services, the field workers need to be backed up by specialists, often working in teams, whose skills are crucial to the whole success of the work. This professionalism is reflected in the very high proportion of the cost of each service that goes in staff salaries."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman read from the report. He emphasises that expertise and knowledge must be inbuilt in the people who are appointed. Opposition Members claim that Lothian and Strathclyde have already achieved that expertise and knowledge. They have done that without any statutory requirement. The hon. Gentleman should take account of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it is not only a matter of statutory requirements for qualifications, especially in education. The General Teaching Council for Scotland was one of the most important organisations to claim that one could not teach unless one had attained a qualification, undergone a probation period and was deemed to be of a standard that was acceptable to Scottish education. It is one of the merits of the Scottish education system that the General Teaching Council raised standards in a period during which other parts of Europe and the United Kingdom struggled to maintain standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a regional association president of the Education Institution of Scotland and a member of the EIS council. Many people from other parts of the United Kingdom were denied access to teaching in Scotland unless they retrained so that their qualifications and expertise fitted the Wheatley proposals and principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's comments about the teaching profession. However, the amendment refers to the appointment of directors of education. I thought that we were discussing directors and their qualifications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a point. We are considering the appointment of an education committee. The qualifications of teachers are outwith the scope of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. The amendments cover directors of education. A director of education should have an appropriate qualification. That has come to mean people who have a professional qualification in education or in social work, depending on which directorship is being applied for. People do not come in from, other professions with other qualifications and claim management abilities which they think are transferable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My response to the points made by the hon. Member for Tayside, North is that the Committee should discuss someone who would know what the statutory duties were. Since Wheatley there has been 20 years of growth in the quality of professionalism. That should be enshrined in statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>949</span>
The good thing is that the regional authorities that were set up have implemented many of the aspirations—not just the remits—of the Wheatley commission. The qualification level among the directorate is second to none in Europe. It has stood us in good stead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone through development after development and, despite the fact that we have disagreed again and again with the Minister about the detail of the Government's education policies, many people who agree with the Opposition have been trying to develop standards and have undertaken dialogue with the civil service, the inspectorate and others. That is the great thing about what has happened over the 20 years: despite the to-ing and fro-ing of the politics, the professions have shown that they can deliver the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directorate has shown that it can look after standards and development, which is the important matter that the hon. Member for Tayside, North took on board. Not just the legal requirements, but the development of the curriculum and the caring services have been looked after in a way that only people with an adequate professional qualification can deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter from the social work department of Strathclyde region on the same theme as page 85 of the Wheatley report, which deals with personal social services. The letter discusses the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked a director to state what made directors professional. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The central factor is to do with the promotion of social welfare."</p></blockquote>
That skill comes through experiencing the professional learning process of being a field social worker or a local team manager, or from looking after a group in a division of Strathclyde. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Social workers usually come into social work with strong motivation and a belief in social justice."</p></blockquote>
What they receive through a professional qualification are the skills, understanding and breadth of knowledge to make them the sort of people to run the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What goes for education goes for social work. The letter that I received in 1994 reflects a consistency with the 1969 Wheatley commission report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the scenario put forward by the hon. Member for Tayside, North. He said that it was all right to have enabling authorities as long as there were directors. The Government are driven by the lunacy of the boundaries that they want. That is a prerequisite; it is like a pyramid standing on its apex rather than its base, which makes the whole thing, including the result, look distorted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are enabling authorities because provision cannot be made—a theme I used before was were they unable to provide, not that they chose not to provide—there will be a major problem. Without the amendment's provisions, there would be authorities without a qualified professional and a committee with a statutory responsibility to translate the duties put on it by the Government into activities. There will be problems for the recipients of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Size is important. If there is an adequate size that is in keeping with the Wheatley principles, it is likely that there will be authorities that are capable of providing. They may choose to be enablers, but will be capable of providing. A
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
good example of that is the Strathclyde devolved management schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no better way of showing how schools can be enabled to look after their budgets and their local decisions than that used by Strathclyde. It is an enabling authority, but not because it is incapable of delivering or providing. It has the safeguard of an education committee and an education directorate to ensure that the standard delivered through the devolved management schools is the same for all local authorities. It is not a case of being forced to enable, but of choosing to enable. We think that that is the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we heard quotes and misquotes. The Conservatives argued that we should consider the remarks of the young radical hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North in 1973 who at that time argued against setting up Strathclyde, and for districts loosely, based on counties. My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) made a good point when he said that my right hon. and learned Friend argued then for an all-Ayrshire authority, not for one so small that it represented only one-third of Ayrshire—81,000 souls—which might have been proposed in south Ayrshire. Even then, my right hon. and learned Friend argued for a district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that, being the advocate that he was, the hon. Gentleman quoted from paragraph 369 on page 94 of the Wheatley commission's report, mentioning the idea of an area
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a population of over two million as the area of a single education authority."</p></blockquote>
He omitted the continuation of the statement which was
	<br><blockquote><p>"—even though they were prepared to accept that it"—</p></blockquote>
the local authority of 2 million people in Strathclyde—
	<br><blockquote><p>"constituted a natural region for planning and other impersonal services."</p></blockquote>
There was strong argument in favour of Strathclyde, but the worry that my right hon. and learned Friend expressed at the time was that the size was wrong for an education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important difference at the time was that the Education Act 1962 was in force. It provided for a statutory director of education and education committee. So if Strathclyde had not been chosen but instead there had been smaller authorities based on counties—which my right hon. and learned Friend who then represented Lanarkshire, North argued for against proposals from the then hon. Member for Hillhead—there would still be a statutory education committee and director of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is that we would have had the important relationship for which we now argue, with the Government setting new standards and apportioning duties and responsibilities. At local level, whether county or some other, there would be a qualified person from the ranks of the relevant profession who, with the education committee's support, would be responsible for delivering services on the ground. That is the difference between the proposals of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for the former Lanarkshire, North, now the Leader of the Labour party, and what was portrayed by the hon. Gentleman as support for the Government's plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to tidy this up. I will repeat this morning's quote from the 
	<i>Official Report.</i> Perhaps the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, when he is no longer with the Whip, will tell me what I misquoted. The then hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North, now the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) said in January 1973:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, in order to get this responsiveness it was necessary to move housing from region to district, it is worth while taking education out of the hands of a very large authority and giving it to a smaller authority."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1973; 
	<i>c.</i> 205.]</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Gentleman will say what I misquoted I will gladly apologise and withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quoted a different passage from the one to which I referred. I said that my right hon. and learned Friend the then Member for Lanarkshire, North used the Wheatley commission and quote and left out the words to argue for a smaller district. The quote was selective and gave the impression that at the time my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for the former Lanarkshire, North argued the same case that the hon. Gentleman now argues. That was untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard the submissions, we are genuinely worried that the Minister has not listened. He said that he would create a basis for co-operation. He has not done so. My hon. Friend quoted from correspondence from parent-teacher councils and many Scottish parent organisations. Many more letters repeat the suggestions. What is wanted is the attention of a director of social work and a social work committee, and support for a statutory director of education and education committee. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) appears not to have paid attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past couple of weeks the Minister has indicated that he does listen to submissions from the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland. It is claimed that great efforts have been made to assuage its fears about the Bill. The Archbishop of St. Andrew's, Edinburgh, Keith Patrick O'Brien, the area that covers my part of Scotland, has written:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are particularly anxious that the Bill will make it a duty for the new authorities to set up an Education Committee and appoint a Director of Education—only in this way can it recognise the importance of education to citizens."</p></blockquote>
That makes clear where the Catholic Church stands on the important issue of who should be responsible, and how. The archbishop's letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And from our point of view and that of other Churches"</p></blockquote>
—there is a meeting of the Churches in Scotland to discuss these matters—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is the only way in which we can be sure of any voice in the educational policies of the authorities. We know that the Bill as it stands says that if there is an Education Committee, the system of Church Representation will continue. But it is 'if. And we want the representation to continue."</p></blockquote>
If there are not to be education committees, the rights that the Minister has put in the Bill are worthless. Similarly the appeals relating to catchment areas that we shall discuss later mean nothing if there is no education committee with responsibility for hearing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I will quote a letter from the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland's religion and morals committee, part of which states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We hope that the 1973 wording will be retained … 'Every education authority shall appoint a committee.'"</p></blockquote>
It is important that those who are concerned with the day-to-day running of education are given an assurance that when the Government distributes responsibilities, it will not be into the ether of a possible education committee, with possibly a professionally qualified person. It must not be a case of Kyle and Carrick or South Ayrshire possibly getting something different. Someone must have responsibility as a channel between the Government and their standards, responsibilities and duties, and the parent and child in school and in the family, as part of social work. The Minister should not say, "Take it on trust. Leave people to make their own choices. It does not matter whether or not there is a committee, or a professionally qualified person, because the responsibilities will be met regardless." That is just not acceptable to the Scottish people or to us. It ought not to be acceptable to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents who attempt to get justice under such a system, by appealing directly to the Government in many instances—after all, there need be no one between the Government and parents—cannot hope to succeed, given the legal aid system's present state, and the difficulty of obtaining professional assistance. Parents' only hope for the past 20 years has been with directors of education and directors of social work. To take that away on a political whim after the trite contributions that we heard this morning would be unacceptable and unforgivable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take a slightly different view from that of other Opposition Members, to this extent. The Government are right in principle to say that, all things being equal, councillors should be elected and charged with taking common sense decisions on their own behalf, and be responsible to their electorate for their decisions. That is the democratic process: it gives the electorate the right to choose people who will act in their best interests. Councillors must follow their own judgment according to their best likes. Sometimes decisions are taken that are difficult to understand and explain. However, local authority systems cannot be set up unless trust is placed in the judgment of the electorate and, to some extent, in the judgment of the elected. That is certainly the principle that I take as my starting-point in approaching the subject of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the matter is as simple and straightforward as what I have said might suggest. I listened with interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Frankly, some of what he said frightened the pants of me, if I may use that colloquialism in Committee. The prospect of new professional officers being hired on fixed-term contracts, which might include performance-related indicators—indeed, performance-related pay—worries me very much, given the performance indicators that might be applied, such as saving money by closing rural schools, cutting the costs of rural transport, which is vital in rural areas, or shifting educational attention much closer towards school league tables, which I consider nonsense. I worry whether the existing system with its well-established independent framework of education directors, in particular, would provide at least some defence against central government depredations, in terms of the provision of local education services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>953</span>
The Government should attend first to assuaging some of the fears that have been strongly expressed to me. I accept that the COSLA argument, which has been discussed in Committee, is balanced. I was more persuaded by the straightforward line that was taken by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian, who said that he opposed it, than by the views of other hon. Members who spoke earlier. My local authority, in the Borders region—a good one that provides services and education in particular, at very reasonable cost—has, as the Minister told the Committee, adopted the clear policy, on the decision of its members, that the flexibility offered by the Government's proposed change would be welcome. It makes a strong case for that decision. However, I am worried about the prospect of its missing the wider context of the relationship with central Government. Perhaps the Minister would say a word or two about that should he catch your eye again later, Mr. Martin. We have a tradition of independent Scottish education authorities that have developed their own ethos. Their ethic, principles and traditions have remained entirely separate from the Scottish Office Education Department in its previous incarnation. That might be sacrificed in me new context, which would worry me greatly. The possibilities of coercion and control from the centre would be greatly increased if we took me course that the Government recommend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about resource implications and perhaps I will be lucky in my third attempt to persuade the Minister to deal with that question. It has less to do with the provision of education in south-east Scotland, with which I am most familiar. However, I am genuinely concerned about some of the changes that are being made. I accept the reasons for them. I support the Government's drive towards unitary authorities and towards authorities smaller than the present Strathclyde and Lothian authorities. Hwowever, the Government must answer the claim from people who are responsible for the provision of education in difficult circumstanes that they will lose out on resource allocation in future.

	<p>6.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) says, perhaps I got out too quickly. I went on to the pharmacy school at Heriot-Watt university. That department was closed just after I left because of undergraduates' poor performance. Perhaps I should retire early from the House so that we can see what happens to the mother of Parliaments. [HON. MEMBERS: "Stay in the Liberal party."] I suppose that I asked for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes in the financial provision for education will mean that if the Government are not careful resources that at present are allocated to deal with the severe educational deprivation in inner-city areas, such as Cranhill, will flow out to the smaller unitary authorities outside the centres of our major cities. It is not good
	<span class='label label-info column'>954</span>
enough for the Minister to promise transitional protection. In the long term—I am sure that the Minister will put me right if I misunderstand the position—resources will tend to drift to me outer, smaller unitary authorities established in what is now Strathclyde, for example. That would not be fair. The problem has to be tackled. The message that came loud and clear from me excellent seminar held by Strathclyde yesterday and which I had me honour to attend was that education authorities, voluntary groups and people who benefit from specialist education services are worried by the situation that they may face once the transitional period has expired The Government have said nothing about that A phrase in one of the Minister's earlier speeches said that some of the formulas in the revenue support grant would be examined and that they might give some longer-term protection. I hope that the Minister will deal with that genuine anxiety, which is felt by many people. All hon. Members have received letters about it, but I do not believe that it has been dealt with yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Lothian is too big, I pay tribute to the work that is done in Strathclyde and Lothian. It will interest the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) that I have received a letter from my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel), in which he drew to my attention the fact that the Lothian Federation of Boys Clubs has branches in Peebles and Innerleven. I did not know mat, nor that Lothian regional council gives me federation £5,000 a year to support its excellent work. The tentacles of Lothian extend firth of me region's boundaries to do good work in me Borders. There is genuine anxiety in Peebles and Innerleven that some voluntary groups will suffer if Lothian is scrapped and if me deployment of resources is not studied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must not only tackle me question of finance in the simple terms of amounts of money. There is also a worry about the way in which the transitional period will affect applications for grants. The transitional process will leave the shadow authorities trying to make sense of their budgets and it will be difficult, too, for voluntary bodies to discover what the future holds for them. The Lothian Federation of Boys Clubs will have to look to new combinations of authorities that may or may not replace Lothian region for its money. To whom must it apply? What policy decisions will be taken in the transitional phase?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not acceptable for the Government to leave the important work of groups, such as the Lothian Federation of Boys Clubs, high and dry. The Government are responsible for the oversight of me transitional process and have a duty to explain what machinery the organisations must use to protect their interests. Those organisations are entitled to explanations and assurances because their work is vital to the communities that they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the Government's decision on membership of the committees to retain Church representatives but to take off teacher representatives. I could have understood the decision better if they had taken off both groups. I accept the principle that local authority councillors should be able to set up sub-committees. It is important not to lose the influence of the Church in the education system, but a sub-committee could take care of that. An education authority could set up a sub-committee on to which it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>955</span>
could co-opt members to deal with religious matters. There is perhaps a case for co-opting teachers onto a sub-committee. However, if the Government are removing the statutory duty to have a committee and a director, they should leave councillors to determine what happens with religious education and teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment we have neither one thing nor the other, which is difficult to understand. I am puzzled why the Government are keeping the Churches on the committees, but are throwing off the teachers. I got next to no explanation from the Minister when I asked in an intervention why the Government had chosen to do that. I should like further clarification of the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with some of the Government's principles. However, I want some assurances about costs and motivation. There is a lot more to it than simply giving councillors discretion. If there were to be almost any other administration or combination of administrations, I should be much more inclined to support the Government's proposals. I have grave reservations about the Government's underlying ideas on introducing the changes, which cause me to pause. Unless I receive assurances on which I can bank, I shall be obliged to support the amendments rather than the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The downgrading of education, the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering, the further devolution of school management and all the other trappings that have been introduced in an alien way into the Scottish education system over the past 14 years will be exacerbated and accelerated if the Bill is left, as the Government propose, in the hands of a central authority, which is so inimical to the long-term interests of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite simply dismayed at the prospect of the unpicking of the excellent Lothian education set-up. As is my wont, I shall put my remarks in question form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is about nursery education because mere is widespread concern that nursery education may be jeopardised. Can the Minister provide an assurance that that will not happen and, in doing so, will he place a duty on the new authorities to provide nursery education? In 1993–94, an additional 1,400 new nursery places were created by Lothian. They were provided in areas where the waiting lists were long With that new provision every child in Lothian in the year prior to entering primary school can have a nursery place if the parents want one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Lothian, there are 43 nursery schools, 136 nursery classes in primary schools and the location of nursery places is where they are needed. There are a 1,000 full-time places, 11,000 part-time places, 200 full-time equivalent nursery teachers, 400 full-time equivalent nursery nurses and a large proportion of the children in nurseries are aged three. That is among the best provision of nursery eduction in Scotland and £10 million a year is spent on it In 1993, 20 rural communities were offered nursery education for the first time. That is provision to a European Standard, not a British one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some questions arise from that: (a) would a small authority have the resources to sustain that level of provision; (b) would small communities continue to have nursery education within reach; (c) would the new councils be able to continue Lothian's policy of expansion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, may we go on to the question of the post of chief education officer? That post has been maintained in England as a statutory post. Why are the Government proposing that there be no statutory requirement to appoint directors of education in

	<span class='label label-info column'>957</span>
Scotland? There is a great deal of concern among parents, teachers, the churches and the directorate that Scotland is yet again being used as a guinea pig. I hope that that question is in order—I am sorry, I did not mean to sound so stern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware of the strong view of the COSLA education committee in support of the statutory education committee and the statutory director of education? Ministers will argue that COSLA sought flexibility. The Minister will contradict me if I have the facts wrong, but the decision of the full convention was,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be content to stand on the view being expressed by its individual member councils".</p></blockquote>
That is in a context in which district councils, with no experience of education, predominated. The COSLA education committee supports the statutory requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for flexibility was made by a working group on internal management, which made a submission to a steering group chaired by the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood. It is significant that, for whatever reason, the education service was not represented on the working group. Why was it not represented? That working group was a fake. My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley—he will correct me if I am wrong—was a member of the Paterson committee. Is it not also a fact that the directors of education were not represented on that committee? Although the Paterson committee did a pretty good job as a whole, did that not create a lacuna?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I pick up from what the Minister said that the members of the committee were selected by COSLA? Should not the hon. Gentleman's question be directed to COSLA rather than to the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the exact provenance of Bruce Black's letter. If we are to tackle this problem seriously there should be an urgent meeting between the COSLA education committee and Ministers to sort out this matter. The view of the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland is that the inclusion of professionals from a number of local government services would have been of significant benefit to the deliberations of the working group. The decision to exclude education—spending 50 per cent. of the local authority budget—was outrageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group comprised two chief executives, one director of corporate services, one director of finance, the senior depute secretary general of COSLA, the chief executive of the Accounts Commission—formerly a regional chief executive—one academic, one director of housing, one director of social work and the ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Arthur Midwinter, in a recent paper entitled "The Statutory Position of the Director of Education in Scottish Local Government" said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although the advocacy of such change is usually couched in the soothing language of efficiency (which nobody can oppose), management reform is usually about altering the balance of power within the organisation. It is no surprise to note that the leading members of the Paterson Committee came from Town Clerk or Finance backgrounds. The professionals were conspicuous by their absence."</p></blockquote>
The same comment could be made today as it could in 1975. The working group referred to was weighted in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>958</span>
particular direction and the whole process was in marked contrast to the various working parties of local government professionals set up to advise on the detailed activities of local government in Wales, whose papers were put in the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The views of the directors of education have the strong support of the Scottish School Board Association, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, the Church of Scotland Education Committee, the Catholic Education Commission, the Forum on Scottish Education and all the teachers' professional associations—that is, the principal partners in the consensus approach to education which the Minister responsible for education has advocated so strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In assessing the views of the chief executives, one must bear in mind that the current 62 chief executives, with their deputies and assistants, will be seeking posts in a vastly reduced number of councils. I am not saying that there is chicanery present—rather, that people must be whiter than Caesar's wife in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware of the recent surveys conducted by the Scottish School Board Association and the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, and will he supply details of the outcome of those surveys? In November 1993, the SSBA issued a ballot on the issues of the statutory committee, the statutory director of education and the statutory representation on education committees of teachers and the Church. It received responses from 395 school boards. Of that number, 362 voted as boards; of the other 33, individual parents voted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ballot showed that, 82 per cent. of respondents were inclined to leave things as they were, with education remaining under the control of the education committee and the director of education, with both retaining the requirement of statute. Some 80 per cent. of respondents said that there was no need to place a statutory requirement on the position of chief executive. Anne Hill, the president of the SSBA, estimated at a recent conference in Glasgow that 35,000 parents are saying "leave the law the way it is." If the Government dispute that, having taken refuge in a majority of COSLA for their point of view, they should refute these figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education departments have forged effective working partnerships with health boards, local enterprise companies, reporters to children's panels and the police. The White Paper published in July 1993 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consideration will therefore have to be given to … whether, alternatively, the existing boundaries of other bodies should, in some cases, be altered in order to bring them into line with those of the new councils. The Secretary of State will be consulting interested parties on this".</p></blockquote>
Will a plethora of other public organsiation have to be restructured to fit the shape of the new councils? Have the health boards, Scottish Enterprise, the local enterprise companies, Highlands and Islands enterprise and the sheriffs been consulted on the proposal? If so, what are their views?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern that effective partnerships will be lost and that a health board previously working in partnership with one regional education department will require to have links—which will have manpower implications—with three or more new councils, perhaps with differing policies. There are two dangers in all of that. The first is that of a domino effect which will increase the burden on the public purse way beyond any of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>959</span>
current estimates on transitional costs. Secondly, there is the danger of jettisoning well tried and effective systems and structures and seeing the whole thing collapse like a pack of cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued by the level of detail accorded to the delineation of the East Renfrewshire council on pages 116 and 117 of the Bill. I do not wish to upset my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South, the Opposition Whip, but 49 lines were devoted to East Renfrewshire which is more than to the rest of Strathclyde put together. To what extent are the Minister's views as to what is appropriate for East Renfrewshire and Eastwood influencing views on what should happen to the rest of Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been rude at all during our proceedings but, to put it bluntly, a great deal of this has been engined by a fixation about Eastwood. Even if the heart of the matter is that the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, does not want East Renfrewshire to have an education committee or a director of education or does not believe that such a small council can sustain an education committee and a director, should we not be getting on with the real task of settling an effective education structure for Scotland based on sound common sense and informed by the views of the major partners and particularly those of parents? It is this Government after all who have given us the parents charter and have laid strong emphasis on parental wishes. In addition, section 28 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the exercise and performance of their powers and duties under this Act, the Secretary of State and education authorities shall have regard to the general principle that, so far as is compatible with the provision of suitable instruction and training and the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure, pupils are to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents".</p></blockquote>
Will parents and the electorate really sit back happily and allow the East Renfrewshire tail to wag the Scottish dog on an issue as important as the effective delivery of the education service? Any service which spends 50 per cent. of a local authority budget must be held accountable to a local democratically elected body. Given the emphasis on the importance of the consumers of local authority services, and particularly in the context of the citizens and parents charters.—[

Given the emphasis on the importance of the consumers of local authority services, particularly in the context of the citizens and parents charters, the electorate requires a focus for the provision of education services. There is a clear rationale for the continuation of the statutory requirement for each authority to have an education committee, which can focus its attention on the needs of the education service without the complications and distractions which arise with other responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a clear rationale for the combination of professional educational experience and expertise and management skills and expertise possessed by directors of education. The concept of the generic manager is alien to education and owes more to management theory and business practice than to the practicalities of the effective delivery of a quality service. Children are not factory products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent leading article in 
	<i>The Times Education Supplement (Scotland)</i> made the following sound point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If head teachers and their staffs are to have more responsibilities, the point at which they relate to the policy-makers becomes more important than in the past. The link should be between professionals; otherwise the senior officials responsible for implementing council policy on education will have an impossible task in taking teachers with them."</p></blockquote>
My sixth question is bang relevant to the amendment. Does the Minister agree that the current system of education committees and directors of education has been largely delivering the Government's agenda effectively and economically? Would he agree that we should be seeking a system which makes it possible to build on existing achievements without undue time, energy and money having to be diverted to the creation of new structures which might not deliver the Government's agenda?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
The wickedness of this is the amount of time and energy that is being diverted by this unwanted reform from other things. The achievements of the existing system of education committee and director are considerable. Schools are better resourced and supported, particularly in staffing and in inner city and remote areas. School building programmes have done far more than they could have been expected to do under a number of fragmented authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the response to national initiatives such as the standard grade, the SCOTVEC—the Scottish Vocational Education Council—national certificate and devolved school management been unsatisfactory even in the Government's own view? There have been strong and effective links with partners, head teachers, school boards, HM Inspectorate, title chambers of commerce, the health boards, the local enterprise companies, the police and reporters to children's panels. Is there any Government dissatisfaction about that? If so they should blurt it out during the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is that there exists in local government a certain "quantum" of managerial capacity. In education, that is already fully stretched in the context of the implementation of a plethora of Government initiatives such as the five to 14 development programme, staff development and review, development planning and developed school management, to name but a few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the same officers are required to plan the proposed change to the new authorities, will not priorities require to change? Will not national initiatives be affected? Will not that, coupled with the effect of the transitional costs requiring to be absorbed by the new authorities, have a disastrous effect on teaching and learning in the classroom? What is Her Majesty's inspectorate saying to Ministers about this matter? There is bound to be a significant disruption in schools. Given a Government commitment to reduce local government expenditure, the likely low financial base of some of the new councils, continuing Government pressure for the delivery of national initiatives, and a policy of public sector pay restraint, we are headed for a period of instability and low morale in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My eighth question relates to the joint arrangements. The Minister is aware that in England a Local Government Commission has been operating under the chairmanship of Sir John Banham. I wonder whether he is aware that the commission's progress report which was issued in December 1993 and is entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Renewing Local Government in the English Shires"</p></blockquote>
indicates that the commission believes that the new unitary authorities in England will generally need to concentrate on the strategic functions of service specification, resource allocation, purchasing and monitoring and that the size of the authorities will be best determined by reference to the need to
	<br><blockquote><p>"be of sufficient area to undertake the development function for most services including environmental, social and personal services, housing and education".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always obedient to the Chair, Mr Martin. I do not want to be on the record or to get into difficulty with my colleagues by flouting the Chair in any way. However, I have asked many questions on serious matters. It is not simply a matter of Parliament dreaming something up; they are the considered and distilled views of some of the most serious people involved in education in Scotland These issues worry them; they are deeply concerned. I am worried that they are worried, as are my colleagues. I am also deeply anxious about what happens to the people whom I have the privilege to represent. I say this, I hope without being misunderstood: I am reaching the conclusion that, in education, the measure would disadvantage my constituents who have greatly benefited from the imaginative schemes of Lothian education committee. I also have the strong impression that it would most disadvantage my most-disadvantaged constituents. That greatly upsets me, not only as a Labour Member of Parliament but as a human being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, it was suggested—I am not sure by whom—that some members of the Committee are not all that familiar with the state school system in Scotland and so are perhaps not best placed to make judgments about the impact on that state system of defeating the amendments. Perhaps I may assure you, Mr. Martin, and, through you, Conservative Members that I am not one of those Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know, Mr. Martin, I attended St. Aloysius—a primary school in Springburn in your constituency—and St. Augustine's secondary school in Milton in Glasgow. I was also a teacher at St. Saviour's secondary school in Dundee—a member of the EIS, like the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson). But, unlike the hon. Gentleman, I was also a member of the east of Scotland action group which took strike action in 1974 during the Houghton pay awards. Indeed, I was the only teacher in the school who was on strike. The headmaster put my classes into the assembly hall and no teacher scabbed and took my classes that day; they respected my right—[HON. MEMBERS: "Did they learn more?"] I understand that the educational curve went upwards that day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have long experience of and familiarity with the state education system in Scotland. I send my two sons, Danny and Kevin, to state schools in Dundee. It is the children who attend state schools who will suffer if elected education committees and professionally qualified education directors are dispensed with. Some Conservative Members are not concerned about children who attend Scottish state schools, because they are concerned about another system in which they can afford to place their children. It is important to understand that, although it does not apply to all Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made in this debate of questions of who supports which arguments. The Minister referred several times to the responses to the Government's consultation document on the internal management of local authorities. However, the Scottish Parent Teacher Councils have carried out an analysis of responses to that consultation document. Every member of the Committee should have a copy, because I photocopied it and handed it out to hon. Members last week. Several points are made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>963</span>
about the responses. One is relevant to the Minister's assertion this morning that the document was sent to 665 addressees. The Scottish Parent Teacher Councils asked the Minister who the addressees were and he refused to tell them. That is significant, because if one is looking for a certain type of response, one asks certain people and if one does not want a certain response, one avoids asking certain people. The Scottish Parent Teacher Councils made the point that that document was not distributed widely among those who have a direct interest in education. If it had been distributed widely among them, a very different response might have resulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of curiosity, was the hon. Gentleman among those who received the documentation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. The first time that I saw it was on taking my place in this Committee. It is important for the Committee to appreciate the point. The Minister said that more than 50 per cent. of those who responded were in favour of abolishing the statutory requirement for directors of social work and education and for education committees, but all kinds of people were not asked. The Scottish Parent Teacher Councils were not asked, nor were school boards in Scotland. If the distribution of the questions about the requirement had been widened, different statistics would have emerged. It would have been discovered that those who know and care about education and are involved in it, care about the statutory requirement for education committees and for professionally qualified directors of education and of social work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister placed the responses to the consultation document in open file at the library at New St. Andrew's house. I believe that there were 161 in all, but only 157 were made available to the public. Four responses were not made available. Three were completely mysterious. Nobody knows who made them or what they said. It is not known why the Minister refused to make them public. Neither was the response of Eastwood district council put in open file. We do not know what it thinks about the general management of local authorities. Perhaps what it said did not suit the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, and that was why he did not give the public access to the file at New St. Andrew's house. Will the Minister deal with the issue of the four missing responses? Why were they missing? Who were they from and what did they say? Why cannot the distribution list be made available to the Scottish Parent Teacher Councils or to anyone else who wants to see it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the views of those who are directly concerned with education are isolated from the analysis by the Scottish Parent Teacher Councils, overwhelming support emerges for the retention of education committees and directors of education. There are 18 such responses in favour of the statutory requirements and five in opposition. There is also a very broad base of support for the statutory requirement among respondents with no direct involvement in education, including chambers of commerce, Conservative councillors and Conservative groups on district councils, Labour-controlled authorities and, as I said this morning, the Catholic Church and the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland. That is a very broad consensus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee was suspended for dinner, I was trying to convince hon. Members that there was widespread support for the retention of statutory education committees and directors of education. I have a sample of the letters that were sent to me as a member of the Committee. They support that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be relieved to know that I shall not read all the letters, but I want to give the flavour of the type of people who support the retention of statutory requirements. The Presbytery of Dundee is in favour of a statutory requirement for directors of education and education committees; Dundee Voluntary action, which represents all the voluntary organisations in the city, supports statutory directors of social work and social work committees; the Epilepsy Association of Scotland supports statutory requirements for social work and education; Strathclyde Elderly Forum, to which the Minister referred, is in favour of retaining the statutory requirements for social work directors and social work committees. Grampian Society for the Blind wants to keep directors of social work and statutory social work committees; the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering support those requirements and the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations is in favour of statutory directors of social work and social work committees as are the Scottish Forum for Development Education in Schools, the Secondary Teachers Association and the Free Presbyterian Chinch of Scotland—a body of which Conservative Members are in favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to hear the hon. Gentleman list those organisations. How many of them really understood that the statutory duty to perform those functions still remains? Perhaps they were worried that the fact that there may not be statutory committees and statutory directors implies that the duties would not be performed. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the organisations understood the full implications of the current statute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that every one of those organisations fully understands what this debate is about and fully understands what the consequences will be for the groups that they represent if the statutory requirements for directors and committees for social work and education are removed. That is why they wrote to members of the Committee. They wanted to persuade hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside to vote for what they want, which is the amendments before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North made the case for local authorities to be enabling authorities and for schools to become self-governing. He could happily vote for the statutory requirements because they would be necessary in those circumstances.

Despite what the Minister says, the proposals for schools are politically motivated. I have a copy of a pamphlet called "Save our Schools", which was produced in 1986 by the "no turning back" group of Conservative Members. The pamphlet makes it clear that that group has no time whatever for the existing education infrastructure in Scotland. For example, it is described as a "monolithic system" that is "impervious" and "insensitive" to the desires of parents. The pamphlet states that headteachers are
	<br><blockquote><p>"imprisoned within an impossible system".</p></blockquote>
It argues that the schools should
	<br><blockquote><p>"effectively become independent, autonomous units."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only wish that what the hon. Gentleman says were true. If it were I would not be so frequently disappointed that my party does not deliver much of what I believe in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he wishes that the ideas in the pamphlet had been implemented by the Government. I think that they are now in the process of being implemented. The pamphlet refers to the role of local authorities and makes clear that taking away power from LEAs and giving it directly to schools would allow the
	<br><blockquote><p>"unnecessary and wasteful levels of bureaucracy"</p></blockquote>
to be removed from education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authors of that pamphlet regard directors of education and education committees as such
	<br><blockquote><p>"unnecessary and wasteful levels of bureaucracy".</p></blockquote>
They want a radical transformation in Scottish education and know that those who are most interested in the realities and the quality of education in Scotland are against the revolution that they, as members of the "No Turning Back Group" of the Conservative party, want to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may never have been associated with the "No Turning Back Group", but the pamphlet lists Members of Parliament who were members of that group and who are the co-authors of the pamphlet in which they envisage dismantling piece by piece the education system in Scotland and replacing it by means of their radical revolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listen carefully to everything you say, Mr. Martin, and you are absolutely right. I was trying to say that if there is no statutory requirement for education committees and for directors of education, the revolution described in the pamphlet could be imposed because there would be no professional bulwark to protect the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who put their names to the pamphlet include the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>966</span>
The Bill is about dismantling Scottish education. We want to prevent that happening because we care about quality and about the back-up systems that are necessary to make schools work properly. That means that we care about having a director of education and a directly elected education committee. The same applies to social work. That is why all hon. Members who have at heart the interests of education and social work should support the amendment and, when we press it to a Division, should vote with Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking to the amendments because, as hon. Members know, I was chairman of Lothian education committee. At that time David Semple was the director of education for Lothian. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to David Semple, who was one of the finest public servants in Scottish education. Recently he was awarded the CBE and was appointed to the Universities Funding Council. That shows the calibre of people in Scottish education whose work the amendments try to preserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, we are old friends. We served together on the education committee of Edinburgh corporation—I think that I suggested that he should become member of it at the time. As I listened to him, it struck me tht he really thinks that we came up the Clyde in a banana boat. He gave us all that flannel—beautifully written by civil servants, to whom credit must be given for doing their job well and for providing the Minister with a plausible explanation for the proposals. It is all flannel and is not the Government's real motivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I shall not get into trouble with my hon. Friends for saying so, but I thought that the hon. Member for Angus, East was the first to highlight a point which my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East repeated. The Government have a new agenda for Scottish education. They want the small protected authorities such as South Ayrshire and Stirling, which they hope will be controlled by the Tories—although we shall try to ensure that they will not—to have a new agenda in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of possibly Tory-controlled Stirling, is my hon.

Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who is the Minister of State, Department of Employment? She does not want to stand because she is out of step with the local association as she supports the principle of having an authority that is capable of delivering education and social work services on the terms that my hon. Friend described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. Even people in the Conservative party who understand these matters, have worked in regional councils and know about service delivery think as we do and are prepared to stand up and say so, even if it means losing their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members want schools to opt out and self-governing trusts to be set up. The hon. Member for Tayside, North outlined that and was not apologetic, even though experience in England shows that the whole business is a calamity. There have been feuds between education committees and trusts or boards of governors, or feuds between boards of governors and head teachers. The system is not working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>967</span>
Conservative Members want schools to opt out and then the other services, including services that Labour Members would never have believed it possible to sell, would be flogged off or contracted out under compulsory competitive tendering. The additional services that education and, in some instances, social work provide would be flogged off to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the aim is to opt out all schools and flog off all the services, directors of education and education committees will not be needed. The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) is nodding in agreement, which goes to show that there is an imported education system from south of the border and a Westminster-Wandsworth agenda in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that there are many chief executives and directors of administration in district councils who will lose their jobs and think that they need to create a new type of powerful all-purpose director in the new authorities so that they can take over. It is worrying that so many recommendations have been made by the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and the directors of administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow mentioned the Paterson committee. I was a member of the supervisory committee of councillors that directed the work of that committee. I am not against corporate management in local government. It has been successful in Lothian, where I worked for a while, and in Strathclyde. There must, however, be individual service directors fighting their corner. A corporate chief executive and a director of policy planning should examine a matter from a corporate point of view and a strong director of education, of social work or of leisure and recreation should fight his corner. That would give the right balance between service provision needs and the corporate approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grouping services in huge departments is wrong. Of course there are links between education and social work, between social work and housing, between education and leisure and recreation. That is what the corporate approach put forward by the Paterson committee is about, but it is not an argument for merging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished that the Minister talked about a director of neighbourhood services. Such a directorate would be artificial, a fad, a fashion that was in no way attendant to the needs of the people who services are provided for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss social work and amendent No. 149. Social work has for far too long been the Cinderella of local government. If it is not given its rightful place, with a committee and a director responsible for its development and fighting his comer in corporate discussions, it will fall even further behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will remember, Mr. Martin, as you were involved in local government when Kilbrandon reorganised the probation, child care and welfare services into the generic social work service. That was only in 1970. There were teething troubles and there have been problems, but I think that the social work service is becoming established. It would be detrimental to the development of proper social work, to the encouragement and professionalism of social workers if we lumped the department with another one simply because it was convenient for some local authority chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>968</span>
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where the initiative would come from. The whiskery Minister keeps uttering sedentary questions like, "Don't you trust the local councillors?" or "Don't you trust the elected representatives?" I fear that much of the initiative for getting rid of social work and education committees and for not appointing social work and education directors will come from chief executives who want to retain power centrally and do not want the strong arm of chief officials arguing their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the most important parts of the Bill, yet only two Conservative Members have spoken. Apart from their speeches, and one or two interventions, Conservative Members have made no substantial contributions. But when we were debating boundaries, they got up all the time, making speech after speech, intervention after intervention. That is the astonishing thing—this is what we are really talking about. Conservative Members are concerned about gerrymandering the boundaries and getting areas to suit their own political advantage. We are interested in ensuring efficient and effective services for the people whom we represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a great deal today from the Minister, and we were entitled to hear some evidence that he has been listening not only to the points that we raised, quite legitimately, but also the views expressed by a broad range of groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that the paper outlining the demand for a director of education and an education committee is supported by the Scottish School Board Association, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, the Forum on Scottish Education, the Catholic Education Commission, the Church of Scotland Education Committee, the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, the Educational Institute of Scotland, the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, the Professional Association of Teachers, the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association and UNISON Scotland. That is a broad front indeed. When everyone is out of step but Lord James, that must surely give the hon. Gentleman cause for reflection. As a Minister who has made a great virtue of avoiding confrontation, surely he will want to see whether it is possible to find ways of accommodating the points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister gave a decent response to the queries that have been raised throughout the debate. On the disruption, disunity and dislocation that will occur at a time of great change, I remember asking him specifically whether he was prepared to undertake to lessen the burden in schools while the reorganisation was taking place, or whether he would insist on all the work and the curricular changes that the Government have proposed being carried out. I asked whether he was still intent on moving forward on the timetable as expressed on the development of the Howie proposals. School staff, in particular, as well as parents and education authorities, want to see a slackening in the pace of change if they are to face the upheaval of a reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also did not adequately respond to the question about the budget cuts facing education. I believe that those cuts will have to be addressed by those running the service, which is why it is so important to have an education committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>969</span>
The overspend on the reorganisation that CIPFA has identified cannot be denied by the Minister. I want him to tell us whether he will undertake, in the event of cost overruns in the reorganisation, to find the money. Or does he meekly accept that it will have to come from services? If it does, education committees will have to make teaching and non-teaching staff redundant. They will have to close buildings for lack of finance and reduce materials available in schools. Those problems will face education committees unless the Minister is prepared to guarantee that the costs of reorganisation will be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made some interesting points about savings to come from reorganisation. He made much of their merits. I draw to his attention correspondence that I recently received—and which I assume he has also had—from the chief executive of Central region, Douglas Sinclair. He makes a point about small authorities. One of the Minister's main arguments about small authorities is that if they are unable to provide services, they will be able to link with other authorities to provide them generally. I understand the principle of that, but I am concerned about the practical aspect, in which I think the Government's approach is deficient. Mr. Sinclair argues that the superficially attractive nature of the idea is simplistic, because the history of local government in Scotland does not show a general desire or willingness to enter into such arrangements. I should like the Minister to give examples of such joint efforts working in practice in Scotland in the past. Or perhaps he will tell us his view of the experience in England and Wales following the abolition of the Inner London education authority. I understand that the mooted co-operation and co-ordination did not work nearly as well as had been anticipated, and that the education committees of the boroughs were left to pick up a considerable mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the Minister to explain also how deals and arrangements that councils make with one another for service provision, will be co-ordinated. The staff involved could be pulled in two directions in terms of the work—particularly curricular work—that they are asked to undertake. Presumably they would be employed by one education authority but would undertake work for another. If the two authorities were of different political complexions, despite happening to be beside each other, there would be a clear potential for conflict. Can the Minister provide examples of such conflict being dealt with successfully in other circumstances? Neither I nor, generally, education professionals are aware of that, which is why there is such anxiety about the efficacy of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify why he assumes that a service that a small authority cannot afford to produce will be available more cheaply from a larger authority? That assumes a willingness on the part of the larger authority to make such services available, and at a lower price than the smaller authority would have paid to do the work itself. There is no guarantee that any larger authority, with surplus capacity only at the margin, will want to make services available to smaller authorities. There is no guarantee about the availability of the range of services that will, as the Minister recognises, have to be produced jointly because small authorities will not be able to provide them alone. If education committees are set up, they will have to deal with these problems. Where there is no education committee, who will discuss with the lead
	<span class='label label-info column'>970</span>
officer, who may or may not be an education director, how to tackle these problems? Many substantial problems will arise, which will make an education director and education committee essential. Unfortunately, very few of these matters have been tackled by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I remind the Minister about the points that one of his hon. Friends made about smaller authorities, the issue of efficiency and how little such authorities cost? I have a comparison between Central and Borders on the numbers of skills and the size of the bureaucracies. My argument is that the bureaucracy in a smaller authority is not necessarily smaller than that in a larger authority. If we compare Central and Borders, Central has two-and-a-half times the population, thrice the number of pupils, twice the number of secondary schools, four times the number of nursery schools and classes, five times the number of special schools and units, but it has the same size of directorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Central, the ratio of directorate to pupils is 1:5710; in the Borders it is 1:1933. The ratio of directorate to schools is 1:28 in Central and 1:13 in Borders. There are 36 headquarters staff in Central, but in Borders there are 50. There are more headquarters staff in the smaller authority. That would lead us to assume that smaller authorities are less efficient than some of the larger ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the Minister quoting statistics that bore out that point. If I remember correctly, he selectively quoted that in the secondary sector the cost per pupil was cheapest in Borders at £2,485 and that Fife was next at £2,488. He omitted to mention that the three most expensive authorities were the three smallest authorities. At £4,387 per pupil, Western Isles was the most expensive; Shetland was next at £3,666 and Orkney followed at £3,606. One cannot argue that because Borders is the cheapest authority it proves that smallest is cheaper. The three most expensive authorities are the three smallest authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the case for secondary education. If we consider primary education, Dumfries and Galloway is the cheapest authority at £1,551 per pupil. Strathclyde is second cheapest at £1,581. How can the Government argue that smaller is more efficient and cheaper when the cost per pupil in the primary sector shows that Strathclyde is second cheapest? That stands the Minister's logic on its head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an explanation for the figures: the Government have consistently starved Strathclyde of resources over a long period. That is why the amount that Strathclyde is able to spend on schools in the primary and secondary sectors is less than it should be. That is the explanation of the low cost per pupil. The figures do not justify the assumption that smaller authorities cost less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow, who drew the Minister's attention to the fact that the cost of administration on the basis of equivalent populations showed that Strathclyde is far cheaper in administrative terms than many authorities that are far smaller. If there is a correlation between size and expense, it is not borne out by the figures. The Minister should explain the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is not consistent with the scope of the amendment, which deals with the setting up of a committee. The hon. Gentleman has made his point.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who am I to disagree with you, Mr. Martin, when to say that I have made my point? I presume that you are speaking for the Minister in that regard, that he accepts my point and that there is no automatic correlation between size and cost. Who better than you to explain the Minister's position for him? He has not been explaining well up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss the reasons for an education committee. I was struck by the points that Conservative Members made about whether Labour Members were aware of leisure and education being dealt with by a joint committee in some authorities. I do not have any difficulty with that and am happy for education and leisure to be put together. That is a way of making it clear that there is an education authority. There is clear accountability and responsibility if education, which is a complex issue, is added to another service, but there is still a focus on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing wrong with education being grouped with leisure. If the Minister is arguing that he requires the changes to allow the grouping of education and leisure to be the desired solution, the logic is that grouping education and leisure would not be permissible under existing legislation. However, that is not true. Orkney operates an education and leisure committee. It cannot be the case that the changes are needed to make such action permissible. Had it not been permissible, the Minister would have stepped in with a default order to stop Orkney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has to be a focus for professional services. There has to be a focus of leadership and parents and staff have to be confident that an authority's education difficulties will be dealt with professionally and competently. The Minister has not made a case for change. He has not convinced the education community in Scotland that there is a case for change. I hope that he can persuade us more fully than he has up to now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the important and wide ranging debate, but will first answer the point of the hon. Member for Govan about disruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that services will not be disrupted by the process of local government reorganisation. I accept that social work and education departments are involved in significant developments in their major areas of activity, for example, community
	<span class='label label-info column'>972</span>
care, child care, offender services, devolved school management and the five to 14 programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will never be a perfect moment to reorganise, but it is worth remembering that by the time of reorganisation, the new community care arrangements will have been in place for three years and should have settled down. The five to 14 arrangements and the devolved school managements arrangements will be substantially in place. A White Paper on child care was published last August. Those factors taken together show a major programme of activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to good practice in both services is the development of procedures and expertise that will carry forward after reorganisation. I have no reason to think that the continuous process of development will be seriously disrupted by changes to authority boundaries. The proposals are designed to ensure the smoothest possible handover and maximum continuity of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last Monday at a seminar on the national health service specifically concerned with community care, the chairman of the Lanarkshire health board, who was appointed by the Government to be not only chairman of that board, but chairman of the Lanarkshire development agency, made a substantial point of the fact that the health board's difficulties were being exacerbated in relation to the community because it did not know who the partners in local government would be. It was stressed that the longer the uncertainty went on, the worse it would be for providing a comprehensive community care programme for the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the view of the person whom the Government have entrusted with looking after the area. Scepticism was expressed about the Government's timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member for Hamilton and I were in Aviemore on Friday that issue was discussed. We are aiming for maximum co-ordination to make sure that the resources follow the patient. Not only that, we have given an undertaking that we will send out guidance to those directly concerned in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) made a helpful speech in which he made an interesting point about fixed-term contracts. The terms and conditions in which local authorities employ their staff are not a matter for the Government. While I can appreciate the benefit of contracts of this nature, these are matters which local authorities themselves should decide. I am in favour of the general thrust of my hon. Friend's arguments. Considerable benefits can be achieved by authorities adopting and enabling approach in relation to service delivery. The sense in adopting a range of service delivery arrangements is already widely recognised among local authorities. The Scottish Office will continue to encourage an enabling approach such as my hon. Friend recommends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 31 allows authorities themselves to choose the balance betweeen managerial and professional input that is appropriate to their particular circumstances. My hon. Friend's contribution was most valuable. I hope that on the basis of what I have said he will accept that the flexibility of the clause is the right approach. I also agree with him about the importance of increasing the number
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>973</span>
of school boards. In relation to devolved school management, we highlighted the enabling role of local authorities in the DSM guidelines issued in March last year. They said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under these schemes, education authorities will retain a strategic, enabling and supportive role while decisions at school level will be taken by headteachers, following consultation with their School Board".</p></blockquote>
As with other contractual issues it is for local authorities as employers to determine performance related pay. The Government encourage effective personnel management policies including performance related pay and would wish to encourage its adoption by local authority employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East asked whether Howie would increase the teacher work load and he also asked about resources. I can confirm that extra resources for staff development and training will be made available through the development programme which we will put in place. We will be making extra resources available for 1994–95 followed by further sums in later years. As the development work progresses we will consult education authorities about their plans for the delivery of the new system. As for the link to work load, teachers are already doing most of what is envisaged. The changes will be phased and evolutionary. They will be building on good practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Angus, East asked me about costs. The arrangements for aggregate external finance distribution and inter-authority payment should avoid adverse effects from cross-boundary pupils on council taxpayers, provided that the new authorities are prepared to approach such issues in a constructive manner. The grant-aided expenditure assessments for school education are predominantly based on pupil numbers by attendance rather than on their home addresses. They therefore take account of the authority directly incurring the expenditure. There is a provision in the existing legislation for inter-authority payments for cross-boundary pupils and arrangements are presently operated by the authorities. It is expected that such arrangements will continue to operate with any detailed changes that the authorities see fit to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether I could guarantee that there would never be any rationalisation. I cannot
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
give such a guarantee now. If schools are one quarter full it is not possible to have the benefit of specialist provision for all the neighbouring schools. In certain cases there may be a need for rationalisation. That has been recognised by Strathclyde regional council and by other councils in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been very helpful in explaining how this will work. As I understand him, as pupils living within the Dundee council area attend Monifieth high school in the Angus council area, Angus council will get additional revenue support grant to pay for those pupils but Dundee will get less revenue support grant because those pupils are attending schools in another area. We will therefore be less able to keep open the existing schools in the Dundee council area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will go into that in depth later when we discuss further groups of amendments. There is provision for the Secretary of State to arbitrate in the event of disagreement between local authorities. Section 23(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an education authority … have provided school education with or without other services for any pupil belonging to the area of some other authority, the education authority … may … recover from that other authority such contributions … as may be agreed by the authorities concerned".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. The subsection continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or, in default of such agreement, as may be determined by the Secretary of State, who shall have regard to the estimated cost of such provision."</p></blockquote>
I should like to deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire about resource displacement from city centres to suburbs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just told us that he cannot rule out the possibility of rationalisation. Why then, in a letter in the 
	<i>Paisley Daily Express</i> yesterday, was Malcolm Kelly, the Conservative candidate in the Ralston by-election able to say that there is
	<br><blockquote><p>"no doubt that the present arrangements will continue with Paisley Grammar and St Andrew's Academy becoming joint funded schools".</p></blockquote>
The Minister told us that that guarantee cannot be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are well aware of the facts in relation to Paisley grammar. There were proposals from the Labour group to close it a few years ago. An order was laid before the House by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) then the Minister responsible for education, which brought in the 80 per cent. rule whereby schools that were more than 80 per cent. full had to be referred to the Secretary of State for Scotland. That order was severely criticised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) but is one of the key safeguards on which we are relying today. We shall doubtless discuss it later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked about resource displacement from city centres to suburbs. There is no reason why that should be the case. Revenue support grant is distributed to local authorities

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the hon. Gentleman. It is about the distribution committee of COSLA working with the Scottish Office in an objective manner, making a needs assessment of the authorities to ensure that the allocations are made strictly, fairly and objectively.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->

The hon. Gentleman asked about voluntary organisations. We shall expect the new authorities to honour the commitments to voluntary organisations made by the existing authorities. If special steps are necessary to achieve that, we may take them. My fellow Minister, my hon. Friend the hon.

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, East suggested that the appeals mechanism could not work if there was no education committee. That is not so. The Education (Scotland) Act 1980 lays down that every education authority shall set up and maintain such number of appeals committees as are necessary to enable references to be made and heard by committees. There is
	<span class='label label-info column'>976</span>
no reference in statute to the education committee in relation to appeal committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East raised the issue of who responded to the consultation. Among others, the Scottish Parent Teacher Councils and the Scottish School Board Association were consulted. The consultation paper was widely publicised. Anyone who asked for a copy was entitled to make a response. There was also a copy in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow mentioned the costs in Strathclyde. You have given a ruling, Mr. Martin, that you do not want the details of costs to be mentioned. I now have the net costs for each authority in Scotland and so I propose to write to the hon. Gentleman as soon as possible. I shall also make a copy available to the Committee. In general, broadly similar figures without a huge variation are presented, with the exception of the islands authorities. I shall make those figures available as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked about joint arrangements. An obvious example, from my own knowledge, is in special educational needs: the school for autistic children in Alloa is outstanding. In that school there is continuing co-operation between different authorities. I very much welcome that and believe that it will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not create joint boards. However, if two or more authorities requested the Secretary of State to establish by order a joint board for particular purposes, he would decide whether to respond positively. The provisions in clause 20 allow the Secretary of State to create a joint board for particular functions, when he considers that that is required. There are enabling provisions but we do not envisage those particularly as a way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow raised a considerable number of issues. In relation to health boards, he asked about the effect of the boundaries and whether the boundary changes could have an effect on the boundaries of other agencies. My fellow Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood is dealing with that matter. We shall consider the implications once the boundaries are decided. That matter is under consideration. Many of the hon. Gentleman's tributes to the success of education policies in Lothian were also, if I may say so, tributes to the success of education policies in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gendeman asked whether COSLA's education committee supported the retention of statutory requirements and why no education authority members were on the working group. The answer is that COSLA's education committee supported the retention of statutory requirements, but the COSLA response as a whole took an overview and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, came to a different conclusion. The membership of the working group was agreed by COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the debate has given rise to considerable passions and strong feelings. We start from the basis that our education and social work services are good and that we can be proud of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>977</span>
It is against that background that our proposals to abolish the statutory requirement for education and social work committees and for the posts of directors of education and social work must be seen. We do not propose that there should not be an education committee or a director of education. Far from it. We recognise fully the valuable role of such committees throughout Scotland. Amendments Nos. 245 and 246 will ensure that, following reorganisation, teachers can still be appointed to a committee dealing with education, when that committee wants. We recognise also the leadership and expertise that directors of education and of social work bring to their departments. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock amd Doon Valley referred to the distinguished work of David Semple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I pointed out earlier, no statute requires directors of education to be professionally qualified. Under our proposals, there is no reason why the posts and the committees should not continue, unless the new authorities, which are elected locally, consider that local needs and circumstances merit other arrangements. I remind the Committee that the change has been sought by the majority of local authorities. The structures in each authority should be flexible enough to encompass its needs. In effect, we are giving the authorities the authority to manage themselves. I hope that the Committee has sufficient confidence in local authorities and in local democracy to agree with the sense and value of that proposal. That is why I commend amendments Nos. 245 and 246 to the Committee and why we must oppose the Opposition's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that it is apparently within the Committee's scope to discuss generalities and for hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a few questions for the Minister because I do not think that he dealt clearly with the outstanding matters. First, in reply to the hon. Member for Tayside, North, the Minister said that the local authorities could have directors of social work and of education if they so wish. Will the Minister be quite clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>978</span>
if local authorities do not want such properly qualified and knowledgeable professionals in charge of the service, the hon. Member for Tayside, North will have no redress after an authority has made that decision or none of the guarantees that he asked for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to my point, the Minister said that, under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, a committee is charged with the duty of setting up appeals committees. The Minister will accept that those appeals committees are normally sub committees of the education authority and the education committee. Therefore, regardless of whether education authorities have committees or directors, they are charged with the duty of having appeals committees. How can those possibly deal with allegations or concerns from the populous in the new local authorities that social work or education standards are not up to the level that they expect for their children? I do not understand how one can have sub committees to deal with appeals when one does not have a committee from which the sub committees would come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer that I gave the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: A person may have the qualifications of a chief executive and be an expert in managerial matters, and he may be selected for the post: that is a matter for the authority. When I was a councillor and I had to choose a chief executive, I bore in mind his professional qualifications. That was the correct course in those circumstances. However, it is a matter for local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example that relates to Members of Parliament Jim Callaghan became Prime Minister, but he had not been to university. I do not recall that anyone suggested that he should not be selected because he did not have the necessary qualifications. He was a good Prime Minister.

For the Minister to have had so much time to come up with such unconvincing answers is little short of a dereliction of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister approach his task with all the enthusiasm of the speaking clock. He should have come back and told us how the measures would improve the education service and not dealt with the issue in the off-hand and virtually contemptuous manner that he showed to a broad range of organisations that feel so strongly about education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(d) at least two teachers employed in educational establishments under the management of the authority, nominated in such manner as may be determined by the authority.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main purpose of amendments Nos. 351 and 352 is to enable amendment No. 262 to be inserted in the Bill. The purpose of amendment No. 262 is to allow teachers to be members of education committees. We must ask the Minister—I hope that he will give the Committee a sensible reply—why teachers should be excluded from education committees. Earlier during the debate, he said that Government amendments Nos. 245 and 246 would not disqualify teachers from being members of education committees if the committees wished them to serve. But I believe that it is an invitation to local authorities to stop allowing teachers to be members of education committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous Ministers at the Scottish Office have taken away the statutory right of teachers to vote on education committees. Therefore, they are there only in an advisory capacity. What are the Government afraid of? What advice do they think should be denied to local authorities? What evidence does the Minister have of unhelpful behaviour? In my experience, teachers on education committees have often been the source of important contributions and have become part of a good working arrangement. They have not been on education committees just because of their profession or for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
partisan reason which might be associated with the terms or conditions of their payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the difficult period of rapidly falling school rolls, the teachers' representatives on education committees often negotiated reasonable terms so that people leaving the authority were matched two or three for one by those joining the authority. That allowed a turnover of teachers in the authority. Older teachers left slightly earlier that the normal retirement age if they wanted and were replaced by younger teachers who were being denied access to jobs because of falling school rolls. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South experienced, as I did, younger people entering the profession when older people left. It was often the teachers' unions and representatives on education committees who worked out the arrangements sensibly and logically. The Minister is inviting a diminution of the professional education input that he should have on an education committee. I want him to reply to my questions. Why is his recommendation permissive rather than positive? Has he nothing more to say about Scottish education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are discussing committees, I want to refer briefly to the submission by the Commission for Racial Equality, which is representing an umbrella group consisting of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, various racial equality councils, the Scottish Refugee Council and the Scottish Asian Action committee, which refers to the provision in the clause that allows for three members of the committee to come from religious organisations. Has the Minister taken the submission seriously and discussed it in any detail? The Commission for Racial Equality points out that a large ethnic minority population represents a large number of practising non-Christian denominations. What guidelines or encouragement will allow those ethnic religions, rather than various Christian denominations, to be represented on the education committees? Although Christian denominations do their work proudly, they are often represented on joint presbyteries or councils of churches with other denominations. The non-Christian denominations often do not have that access to joint discussion and they should be represented on education committees. Why make it permissive for teachers to sit on education committees? The Government's decision reflects their adopted status of education and educationists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of representation of racial equality councils and other bodies on education committees. That is a fair point. Under the system, an education committee can co-opt up to 50 per cent. of its members, unlike other local authority committees which can co-opt up to only one third. The size of the committee dealing with education can vary according to the size of the council. The minimum size under the new authorities will be six—for example, three church representatives and three councillors. The maximum size will be twice the number of councillors, of which three co-optees will be church representatives. A large number of councillors will be matched by an equal number of co-opted members. The locally elected representatives of a large ethnic community will be free to act in the way described by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have made clear, we intend to give the greatest possible discretion to local authorities in making
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
appointments to any committee which they might decide to set up to consider education. To increase the number of statutory representatives of any such committee beyond the number given in subsection (4), as proposed in amendment No. 262, would conflict with our policy of giving authorities maximum flexibility. The provisions of the Bill will allow a local authority committee to decide whomsoever it wants to be on the committee. Hon. Members will agree that as far as possible, a local decision should determine appointments to a committee. That is why we have limited the number specified in the Bill to just three people representing various denominational bodies. The churches have participated in such committees for many years, and the results of our consultation last year on internal management show no great desire to change that. We recognise the experience and insights that the churches bring to the deliberations of such committees. To go further, as amendment No. 262 would, and to specify additional appointments in law would unduly restrict an authority's discretion. We are not prepared to accept the amendment on those grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also advised—although I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not intend this effect—that amendments Nos. 351 and 352 could allow an authority to challenge the allocation of three places for Church representatives on such a committee, and possibly to seek to reduce the number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister focus on whether, in an area with a large population of a specific ethnic religion, he would encourage the practice of making the third representative on any education committee a representative of that religion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Church representative must be a Church representative. It is not for me to specify his occupation or profession. In answer to the hon. Gentleman's earlier question, we believe that teachers should be treated in the same way as any other employees and that there is no reason for special treatment, although, of course, committees would be free to co-opt teachers if they wished. That should be up to local democracy and the elected councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense strongly from the statement that has just been made that teachers can be treated in this context as just "any other employees". I do not understand that at all. Surely there should be a statutory obligation to put forward what I can only call the view from the chalk face—the view of those who do the job. Without making too much of teacher amour-propre, I consider it rather insulting in this instance to call them "any other employees". It is not accurate. The Minister revealed in his answer why some of us feel strongly that there should be statutory representation. It is also a question of teacher morale. The insult implied in the Minister's attitude is damaging to that morale. Like the teachers' organisations and many others, I feel strongly about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister really mean that in the context that we have been discussing, teachers are just like any other employees? There is no reason, in many contexts, for treating teachers differently from anybody else. But in the context of decision-making that affects their jobs which, heaven knows, is far more difficult than when I did it—young teachers especially are under enormous
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
pressures—to describe them as just like any other employees and to argue that they should not have statutory representation is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general, a committee may co-opt a lay person representing a Church denomination as one of the three Church representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If councils take the same view as the hon. Member for Linlithgow, their way forward would be to co-opt the teachers. Leaving aside the fact that the amendments seem to be incorrectly drafted, we believe that it is important to give the authorities maximum flexibility in making appointments to any committee dealing with education. In that way, local needs and circumstances can best be taken into account I therefore oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being far too restrictive. He is underplaying the role and the value of teachers as representatives on education committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the representation of the Church on education committees as a right. The input of the Church is something that society omits at its peril. In a world and a political system that stress all too often the immediate, the expedient and the short term, it is crucial to have a voice based on eternal rather than short-term truths. The impact of the Church—which I interpret in the broadest fashion—is an asset which should inform and educate the progress and development of the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are missing out when it comes to teachers. Their representation democratically reflects the reality of the chalk face. Teachers are a representative and a practical asset to committees. Co-option is not good enough. Teachers have been represented on committees as of right, and I believe that they should continue to be represented on committees as of right, as well as on merit, because of what they have contributed in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People either believe in the proven worth and value of such outside representation, or they do not. I do, and I shall certainly support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to many people that this should be a matter of right and not of whim. The Minister talks about the Committee making up its mind and taking a certain view. If that view is unfavourable, there will be trouble. This is a matter of whim when it should be a matter of right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) tabled an amendment roughly similar to the Government's, although he confined it to the Western Isles.

I also recognise the contribution of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland which drew the submission tojthe Committee's attention. I welcome the fact that the Government have noticed it as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised Dr. Boyd of the Free Presbyterian Church that I would bring it to the Committee's attention that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Western Isles Islands Council have informed us that it is their intention to appoint an Education Committee and that the Free Presbyterian Church and the Free Church will have same opportunity as at present to appoint representatives to sit on it"</p></blockquote>
He points out that that will not bind the successor, which is unsatisfactory. The letter to Dr. Boyd continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Director of Administration and Legal Services has drawn attention to the fact that the phrase you drew attention to was omitted from the new legislation because the new Local Government structure is to be single-tier. Islands' Councils will no longer have a special status.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Western Isles Islands Council are able to appoint four representatives of religious interests and still be within the law by making use of the provision available in Part I (2)(a)."</p></blockquote>
On 2 March, Dr. Boyd wrote to the Minister, expressing his worries and asking if he would retain the
	<br><blockquote><p>"extra representatives for the Western Isles Island Council, as explained in the accompanying letter, as in section 124 3(a)(iii) of the 1973 Act."</p></blockquote>

The Committee may be interested to know the composition of the Western Isles council. There are five Church representatives on the education committee: two

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key part of this group of amendments relates to new clauses 11 and 12 and I shall concentrate on them. I say that not because I do not want to discuss new clauses 21, 22 and 23, which were tabled by the right hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire who will want to discuss them—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, I meant the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. He obviously should be the right hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. It will only be a matter of
	<span class='label label-info column'>986</span>
time before the Local Democrats seize power in this country and he becomes a right hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important. New clause 11 would place a duty on every education authority to ensure that adequate and efficient provision is provided for its area, not only for school education but for further and community education. They are just as important as school education for the people we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 12 would place a duty on local authorities to secure adequate and efficient pre-school provision for children under the age of five in their areas. We want a statutory duty to be placed on local authorities to make adequate provision for the important parts of the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous debate, the Minister argued against the necessity for a statutory requirement for a director of education and for an education committee. He said that a duty was written into the statute which meant that the authorities had to provide school and social work services. If that is the logic of the Minister's argument, surely he must accept the logic of the new clause. The same statutory duty should be placed on local authorities, not only to provide school education but to ensure that proper further, community and nursery education is available in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that all members of the Committee agree that we want a culture of life-long learning in Scotland. People should not be educated between the ages of five and 18 only, but should be educated throughout their lives, by having access to education and the ability to transform their own opportunities. For that to happen, it is essential that colleges of further education are made accessible to every member of our communities. It is essential that those colleges are placed under local, democratic control of local elected Scottish authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts speak for themselves in support of that idea. In 1991, only 24 per cent. of 18-year-olds in our country were in full-time education compared with over 60 per cent. in France and Japan. According to the European Commission in 1990, only 38 per cent. of the United Kingdom work force had undergone skilled, vocational training compared with 58 per cent. in Spain, 67 per cent. in West Germany, 79 per cent. in Italy and 80 per cent. in France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the poor comparison between this country and our main competitors in Europe and elsewhere in respect of the percentage of those in various age groups who have access to education. The situation is even worse for the unemployed. Only one third of youth trainees gain a vocational qualification. Only 27 per cent. of adult trainees on training-for-work and previous schemes gain qualifications or credits and only 19 per cent. find employment. If we are to do anything about our country's disgraceful record of further education qualifications, there must be greater access to further education. That is why the amendments are so important.

	<span class='label label-info column'>987</span>
The Government believe that it is necessary to place a statutory duty on local authorities to provide school education. The Minister must therefor justify his decision not to place the same statutory requirement on local authorities to provide access to further education, which is every bit as vital as school education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community education is closely allied to further education. Members of the Committee have received a briefing from Lothian regional council which included information on a study that it carried out recently in Pilton. It showed the strong link between residence in deprived areas and educational failure. Anyone who has worked in such areas would agree with the study's findings. Time and again I have found that people in those areas blame themselves because they failed at school. They say, "I wasn't any good at school. It was my fault, I couldn't pass the examinations or get 'O' grades or standard grades". It does not occur to them that the system was failing them, not they who were failing at school. Our education system fails so many people. They deserve another opportunity for access to education when they have left school. One of the most important ways of gaining such access is through the community education service which is run by the regional councils. That is important for all kinds of groups in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many single parents, mostly young women, live in areas of deprivation. If they are ever to get back to work, they need a bridge to help them to do so, and the community education service is one such bridge. It gives them encouragement and the confidence necessary to get them into employment and off benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is equally true of the many people who suffer from long-term unemployment. They do not have confidence and blame themselves for their failures. They, too, need the encouragement that the community education service can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community centre in Mid-Craigie, one of the poorest areas of my constituency, has a group of community education workers and community social workers who do a first-rate job of building the confidence of the community and transforming the environment of people living there. Not so long ago, the area was written off and no one wanted to live there—it was called a low-demand area. It is beginning to recover, partly because of the work done by community education and social workers. They have learnt something which has taken political parties much longer to learn—that people do not want handouts, they want a hand up to get them out of the circumstances in which they find themselves. The community education service gives people the confidence and help that they need to help themselves and tp transform their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand how the Government can argue that education authorities should not have a statutory requirement to ensure that there is an adquate community education service in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we compare Scotland with other countries, our nursery provision—and that of the rest of the United Kingdom—is modest. Nursery education is a non-statutory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several regional councils are making a tremendous effort to provide nursery education. Lothian regional council has written to inform us that it has spent £10 million on nursery education in 1993–94. It is committed
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
to providing a free nursery place for every four-year-old in Lothian by Easter 1994. Labour-controlled Tayside regional council has made the same commitment. The Labour party does well in regional council elections partly because we make nursery provision a priority in our manifesto. Conservative candidates do not do that and that is partly why they do badly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the local authorities that the Bill creates will cause problems for the provision of nursery education. The Borders is a small authority. Therefore, only 20 per cent. of three and four-year-olds receive nursery education, compared with 48 per cent. in Lothian. More than twice as many kids in Lothian as in the Borders receive nursery education. Lothian's size enables it to have a budget that can cover nursery provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By creating 30 new education areas, the Government make the provision of education services difficult. Size is the crux of the matter. The Minister argues that a statutory right exists to receive Catholic education and other provisions from the new Dundee education authority. The authority will consist of only 150,000 people. It will receive a small revenue. We shall not be able to maintain 12 secondary schools. There are three Catholic secondary schools in Dundee. Two are situated cheek by jowl. It will be difficult for whoever wins the elections to keep those schools open. But I genuinely believe that that is the Government's aim.

On Sunday, 
	<i>The Observer</i> published a front-page story about circumstances in England. It stated that Treasury pressure was forcing the Secretary of State for Education to close 1,000 schools in England and Wales. The Treasury aimed to make that saving by identifying surplus places in schools. The Secretary of State for Education said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there are two schools within two miles of each other, and there are many surplus places, there should probably be only one school. We want top-quality schools, not half-empty schools such as those kept by Labour education authorities".</p></blockquote>
That is happening in England and Wales. The Government intend to do that in Scotland, but they are frightened of admitting it. They want education authorities to close what they regard as half empty schools and are driving toward that with all the determination that they can muster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued time and time again in Committee about the cost of local government reform. The Secretary of State for Scotland sold the proposals to the Treasury on the basis that there would be significant savings from local government reform. Those savings will come from shutting down schools. That is what the Government and the Bill are about. They are making it almost impossible for the authorities to provide proper community education, proper further education and proper nursery provision. I think that I have said enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is regrettable that this group of amendments has the misfortune to be discussed at the end of the day's business. We have had a full debate and something must come last, but I am disappointed that it had to be nursery and pre-school education, which is an important subject, certainly in my area of south-east Scotland and the Borders region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unsatisfactory that we have not had a chance to consider coherently the service areas that the local authorities will provide. Given the way that the Bill is constructed, it is difficult for the Committee to have a consistent debate. It would have been better to have been able to systematically balance the relative weights of social work, education, roads and planning so that we could have a clear idea of what is required of the new authorities. However, we have been able only to take snapshots of some of the details because of the order of the clauses. We can have a short discussion at this time of night on pre-school education because of the way in which the education sections have been drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From press reports and comments on the Floor of the House, I understand that the Prime Minister has made a personal commitment to try to include nursery and pre-school education in the education system throughout the United Kingdom. I await with interest the fruits that flow from his best endeavours. I remember his previous undertakings, such as his determination in 1991 to
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
remove motorway cones from the motorways of Britain. The last time that I travelled on the M6 I thought that I should not use it again because there were so many cones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If no less a person than the Prime Minister has made that an important priority for his Government, who is the Under-Secretary of State to contradict a policy decision taken at the highest level? The new clauses to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East spoke so ably, and my new clauses 21,22 and 23, would give the Under-Secretary the ability to deal with issues such as further education, community education, day nurseries and pre-school play groups in a Scottish context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency experience suggests—the hon. Member for Dundee, East made passing reference to this issue—that no matter how efficient are rural authorities in delivering the high standards of service that for example, the Borders region provides in education, they find it difficult to make sensible provision for pre-school play groups and day care centres for children in disparate communities over a wide geographical area. One does not have to be an educational expert to understand the reasons for that. With a wide area and a small population spread out not just in small market towns, but in tiny villages, it is difficult to cater for all needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have looked at the hon. Gentleman's new clauses and, to be honest, they seem to be full of merit. However, has he costed them? How much would it cost to implement those new clauses across Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly valid question, but the answer to it is that I have not done a precise costing. At the last election my party made a specific pledge that we would raise taxation if necessary in order to pay for such a proposal. This is a specific and extraordinary priority. We believe that if the question were put squarely to the public, in a hypothecated context, that an amount of money should be generated specifically to be spent on education, some of it on nursery education, we would win the argument and they would accept that such a tax increase was justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman acknowledges that the new clauses are full of merit, but I accept that they would have a cost. I am not proposing that they should be implemented by 1996. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East said, a commitment to impose targets on the new councils to achieve substantial improvements would provide the level of service that all hon. Members want to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although these proposals would have a cost, they would be beneficial in the long run. Single-parent families, predominantly mothers, and people who are in a cycle of dependency on the benefits system, would be able to take on part-time and other productive work, which would save a lot of money in relation to social services. It would also give increased earnings opportunities to many households in low-wage areas, such as mine. Rural areas in south-east and south-west Scotland and in parts of Ayrshire, if not the town itself, suffer from low wage rate economies. That is a matter for regret, because the only way that some of those households can survive is through twin earnings: a two-earner income is made possible only when there is provision for the younger members of the family.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>991</span>
Although the clauses come with an obvious cost, in the long run they would be beneficial even to the public purse and would result in social improvements to the situation of families diroughout the length and breadth of Scotland, especially in rural Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should invest money in community education. I have been involved—perhaps involved is not the right word, because I would be taking too much credit—I have been interested in watching the setting up of the Eyemouth Dry Dock project. The regional authority community education department set up custom built premises, which the youngsters of the town, with some support from community workers, ran as a dry dock, including a cafe. That is a splendid example of what can be done to get youngsters off the streets. They decide which experts to consult about the problems of AIDS, drugs and alcohol dependency. They are in control of their own agenda. It is a very popular facility and it is a model for what could be done in all the market towns in the Borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five or six of such projects could be set up to provide services that do not exist now: that would get youngsters off the streets. Ahhough were would be a cost, it would save far more that what it would cost to deal with vandalism and other criminally related problems that can get out of hand when youngsters find their way into pubs, get intoxicated at an early age and cause damage, inconvenience, distress and dislocation, not to mention the violence and assaults that some of diem perpetrate in their worst excesses.—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am being led astray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of initiatives must be taken by the new councils to improve the provision for community education. When next the Minister visits the Borders, if he wishes to meet groups of youngsters in towns such as Kelso and Hawick, I shall be pleased to take him there. Those young people have recentiy experienced enormous difficulty and had vehement opposition from the local licensing authorities and others in their attempt to set up a pub that would be dry for two days a week. A publican was persuaded to help them with premises, but they faced all sorts of difficulties trying to get community education facilities to support them. It was perverse in the extreme. If the Minister accepted new clause 21 and imposed a duty on the new councils to examine some of these issues seriously, he would do a great service to young people who need the facilities, as well as saving public expenditure in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give a serious response to our amendment. I realise that it is late and that the Committee wishes to make progress, but these are important matters and deserve serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether Northern Ireland has dry-two-days-a-week pubs, Sir James, but one does learn tilings in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Lothian there is widespread concern that nursery education may be jeopardised—and not least in the burgeoning town of South Queensferry—for years part of my constituency but which may be part of the constituency that the Minister hopes to represent after the next election. There is considerable concern in areas populated by young people. I ask for the Minister's assurance that nursery education for the very young will not be put at risk. I ask him to impose a duty on new authorities to provide this education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
During debate on the previous amendment, I had a great deal to say about nursery education. Maybe it should have been postponed until now, but I leave it on the record. This is our only opportunity to discuss community education, despite the lateness of the hour. Lothian's policy is to create the best possible sporting opportunities. The regional council's sports unit of two officers has developed considerable knowledge and understanding of sports needs. The unit strives not only to increase participation but to relate all sporting opportunities to the whole context, embedding diem in local community culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian can claim to offer a broader range of sporting opportunities for children than most Scottish regions. There are 21 sports associations with areas based inside Lothian's boundaries. Some features of the service include 26 swimming staff—equivalent to 12 full-time teachers, considerable co-ordination to offer specialist tuition, 40 swimming pools, 29 sports and games halls, special attention to equal opportunities, partnership products with team sports and the Scottish Sports Council, responsiveness to initiative, and eight major stand-alone playing fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that invites questions. First, how could Lothian's outstanding success be sustained by smaller authorities? Secondly, would a smaller authority have the staff and resources to sustain school sports associations for minority sports. Thirdly, would officials in smaller authorities need to spend more time in discussion with other smaller authorities to co-ordinate opportunities in the minor sports? Fourthly, how would amateur sports bodies relate to several Lothian authorities? Fifthly, how would the various school sports associations with areas based on Lothian boundaries operate after local government reorganisation? Having had children in Lothian schools in the place that I mentioned, I know at first hand, not anecdotally, that these are pertinent questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question concerns music and the arts in Lothian education. I believe that music is central, not peripheral, to any curriculum. Lothian regional council recognises that the arts are a major source of learning and experience. They are also considered to be an important generator of community feeling and economic enterprise. One officer for the arts co-ordinates all the activities in the education department. Lothian region has long recognised the need to support and develop the existing contribution to the arts in schools, both through the curriculum and, informally, through clubs, orchestras and workshops. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, who started of many of those most imaginative schemes when he was in a position to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian regional council continues to support community arts. About £13 million is spent on the arts every year by Lothian region education department. It gives £600,000 in grants and £177,500 to the Edinburgh festival. It makes large grants to the children's festival and the Edinburgh jazz festival. It supports orchestras, ballet and opera. It has a one-door approach to Lothian schools and advises arts organisations on the curriculum. It funds special arts projects and advises schools and arts organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Six questions need to be asked. First, how can a small education authority support an arts officer and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
necessary support staff? Secondly, how can high quality initiatives be maintained without a co-ordinator? Thirdly, how can a small authority support specialist tuition for disciplines such as dance? Fourthly, how can the excellence achieved by Lothian in this area be maintained with much reduced resources on a smaller scale? Fifthly, will the new authorities be able to offer, pro rata, their share of the £13 million spent by Lothian regional council on the arts? I doubt that they will. Sixthly, will education in schools and in the community be as rich culturally under the new authorities as they are at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of community education is dear to my heart. I had long experience of it in my time in a local authority. I strongly support making community education a statutory provision. Services that are provided at present need to be protected. That can be done by making them statutory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community education is now recognised in Scotland as an established and identifiable sector of an education department. It encompasses primarily the full range of informal education services to young people and adults and promotes learning opportunities in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to note that community education is a distinct sector from both schools and further education but that it works in close collaboration with both, forming part of an education authority's overall provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community education has become a recognised service at local authority level, but national legislation has failed to recognise adequately the existence of the range of services offered by the community education service and to fund them accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the purpose of the amendments. I do not want to go into the history and scale of community education, because I realise that hon. Members want to get away, but it is important to stress that the voluntary sector plays a key partnership role with the community education service in delivering community education provision in Scotland. The community education service has a pivotal role for education services in working with young people, those with special needs, the disabled, the elderly, ethnic minority groups and the unemployed. It runs comprehensive programmes of adult and continuing education. A key role has developed in delivering essential skills in community empowerment, community care, community enterprise and community regeneration schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is severe concern that the Bill will seriously affect the support given by local authorities to the sterling work of the voluntary sector. I would very much like the Minister to provide clarification on that point. In Strathclyde alone, £35 million supports the services offered by voluntary and community organisations. There is a genuine fear that voluntary organisations will be unable to survive the upheaval that will take place as a result of reorganisation. The Minister has heard, but not assuaged those fears. In a situation where finance is tight, the voluntary sector, which provides non-statutory services, will be among the first to suffer. There are serious questions about the continuity of the funding for the voluntary sector through the urban programme projects
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
as well as the range of local authority professional support for communities and volunteers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to place on the record the range of services that are offered in various areas by the voluntary sector and by community education. They represent clear value for money. It is value for money in terms of the number of volunteers that are generated for that type of work and, as my hon. Friends have said, it avoids expenditure being made by other council departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community education service and the support given to the voluntary sector deliver vital services to tens of thousands of people in communities throughout Scotland, ranging from the provision of youth clubs, adult and continuing education classes, community education centres, ethnic minority language classes, support for arts and cultural organisations, the provision of after-school care, the promotion of gaelic culture and language to the continued development of the Government's policies on community partnerships and empowerment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substantial underfunding of partial statutory services, such as community education, together with the fracturing, splintering and atomisation that the current education system has avoided, will inevitably mean that that type of service, without a clear legislative base, will be restricted and suffocated by smaller authorities that will be unable to afford such provision in the future. In those circumstances, I hope that the Minister will accept amendment No. 263.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Education provision for under fives and community education are extremely important. It is right that the Committee should deal with them. I fear that they are the areas of education that could come under most pressure as a consequence of the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one specific point that relates to something the Minister said about provision for under fives. Lothian region's provision for under fives nursery education is second to none. Earlier, the Minister said that existing education services would continue. Lothian provides the best service in Scotland: every child whose parents want it to have nursery education at the age of four is guaranteed a place. The Minister has suggested that that guarantee will stand, but I want it in black and white and on the record how that can be continued in outlying areas, such as the rural areas of East Lothian, when they are cut off from the central provision in the urban area of Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments promote community and further education and pre-school provision. I simply want to add my support to the amendments because I believe that education is for life. There is a massive need for pre-school and nursery education not only in themselves, but for good economic and social reasons. As more women join the work force, there is more need for extra pre-school and nursery facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main argument, however, relates to the undoubted educational benefits of such provision, which are proven and effective. It is time that Scotland caught up with the rest of Europe in ensuring that we have the very best of such provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former further education lecturer, I know at first hand of the benefits of that system and of the community education set up, which has brought a new lease of life
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>995</span>
and opportunities to adults. It is essential that education authorities make provision for adult basic education and community education, which provide educational opportunities for adults after they have left school. In England and Wales, further education colleges are required by law to provide literacy and numeracy services but, in Scotland, where education authorities are major providers of adult basic education, no such requirement exists. I simply ask the Government why that is so. It is important to promote those services. Those who missed out on education in the school system must be allowed a second chance to fulfil their potential. The Government's proposals do not provide safeguards for the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commumty education service is an important resource for young people and adults who have benefited least from the other services. It enables people to gain new access to educational and training opportunities and to contribute positively to the life of their community through community organisations, self-help and community enterprise. I seek Government assurances that those sectors of education will be given the support that they deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a significant debate. The hon. Members for Dundee, East, for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, for Linlithgow, for Govan and for Angus, East have highlighted the importance of commumty and nursery education. I confirm that £88 million in Government-supported expenditure is provided for community education, but the education authorities budget to spend below that figure. Their total budgeted expenditure for 1993–94 is £80 million, which compares with some £78 million in 1992–93. It is obviously a matter for individual authorities to determine their expenditure on that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan raised various matters relating to community education. The Scottish Office provides additional grants totalling £2 million to the Scottish Community Education Council and to national voluntary organisations in the community education sphere. A further £1.4 million is made available in capital grants to local community groups. I do not know whether that is of relevance to the concerns of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. He referred to a project in his constituency.

I have already given an answer about funding of voluntary organisations and I assure hon. Members that that answer is still the same.

As to nursery education, about £100 million extra a year will be needed to extend the present mix of part-time and full-time places to all three and four-year-olds, as well as about £250 million extra a year to provide full-time places for all three to four-year-olds in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know in the next few minutes. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not have the information readily available, but I shall make sure that I provide it as soon as I can obtain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
I shall study the questions of the hon. Member for Linlithgow with care and respond to them. I should rather give a correct, considered reply. The only reply that I should like to give now, off the top of my head, is that we, of course, recognise the importance of sport, music and arts and libraries. I am sure that the new authorities will also recognise their importance and try to maintain and develop those subjects. The hon. Gentleman referred to Mr. George Cunningham. I saw him this afternoon to discuss the future of school library services following local government reorganisation, and we had a most useful meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 11 and amendment No. 263 focus on the provision of community education. There is a statutory duty on existing councils which the new councils will inherit. At present, education authorities provide community education as part of their duty, under section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to secure the adequate and efficient provision of further education. That includes social, cultural and recreative activities and physical education and training either as voluntary organised activities designed to promote the educational development of persons taking part there in or as part of a course of instruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal advice I have is that that description adequately covers all the activities which are recognised as community education. There is, therefore, no need to specify in the Bill a specific statutory requirement to provide community education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duty in section 1(1) will transfer to the new councils, and there are no obvious reasons to suspect that they will be any less assiduous in providing community education than existing authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That apart, new clause 11 would impose upon authorities, for the first time, a statutory power and duty to secure the provision of community education per se. In the absence of a statutory definition of community education I believe that imposing such a power and duty would neither be meaningful nor helpful, and could well lead to confusion and jeopardise existing services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me reaffirm the Government's continuing commitment to community education as an integral part of the education service. We value the role it plays in enriching the fives of the communities it serves. I am happy to give an undertaking to consider, in any central guidance that is issued to the new councils, the guidance that should be provided on the discharge of their responsibilities for community education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 21 would, if accepted, result in two broadly parallel powers placing an obligation on an education authority to secure the provision of school education and further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already rehearsed the arguments against new clause 11, which would place on an education authority a duty to provide community education. I regard the new clause as defective and, in any case, unnecessary. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 12, 22 and 23 would provide "pre-school" provision for all children under five years of age. I first make the point that there are drafting deficiencies in new clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would in general very much like to see an extension of nursery and other pre-school provision. Our long-term goal is a full range of options
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>997</span>
which will satisfy the requirements of all parents of pre-school children, but those ambitions must be tempered by reality. They can be achieved only as resources become available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not overlook what has already been achieved. Since the Government came to power in 1979, the number of children attending nursery schools has increased from 31,700 to 47,000. That is an increase of nearly 50 per cent Moreover, taking provision for under-fives generally—and I include nursery schools, day nurseries and pre-school playgroups in that grouping—there are now sufficient places available to enable authorities to cater for almost 80 per cent. of three and four-year-olds in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to exploring ways of adding still further, as resources allow, to the choice available to parents. But that must encompass choice in the public, private and voluntary sectors. We must guard against the danger that favouring one element may cause another to fall by the wayside. That could be the effect of new clause 23 and I know, for example, that the Scottish Pre-School Playgroup Association is very concerned that that should not happen. In encouraging choice and diversity in response to children's needs and parents' preferences, the Government will continue to promote quality and cost-effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report issued by Her Majesty's inspector of schools on 21 February supports this policy. But as the report emphasises, the ages of the children involved and their patterns of attendance vary considerably across a range of settings. Provision for education for children under 5 requires a sensitive and variable approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally, new clause 22 would make education authorities responsible for management of educational services in establishments provided in the voluntary and independent sectors in playgroups and private nursery schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines supporting the Children Act 1989 have, through the registration provisions, placed greater emphasis on quality of the experience provided for children in day-care establishments. The education authority is obliged to act jointly with local authorities when they review, as they must under the provisions of the Act, the pattern of day care in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
The aim is for diversity and choice. New clause 22 recognises that as a correct approach. I am grateful to hon. Members for raising these important subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, safeguards through the involvement of education authorities under the Children Act 1989 and through the inspectorate report issued earlier this month mean that the position is very well protected. Therefore, I invite hon. Members not to press the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
