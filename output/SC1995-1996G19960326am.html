	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain how I intend to rule on new clause 35. Because it was agreed that clause 152 stand part of the Bill, it means that new clause 35 is not available for selection. However, the Government amendments are not attached to clause 152, but stand alone and will be taken formally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DUTY WHERE OTHER SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 566, in page 81, line 9, after 'district', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>or, for, for authorities in London, the Greater London area'.</p></blockquote>
I shall take a little longer on this amendment than I have taken on others. In recent years, a significant number of local authorities have looked to the private sector as a source of additional supply in a continuing move from provider to enabler. However, the provision that no duty arises if a local authority is satisfied that suitable accommodation is available in it sown district is potentially too restrictive. I said earlier in Committee that, in the '1977 survey, 45 per cent, of Westminster's housing stock was in the private rented sector. It is still one of the largest in the country and currently comprises about 35 per cent, of the total housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Westminster's housing stock has suffered traditionally from a distinct polarisation between the top end and the bottom end of the market. Even at the bottom end, rents are relatively expensive and are often above housing benefit thresholds, with tenants consequently experiencing rent restrictions. Thus, while local authorities with an abundant supply of affordable, suitable private rented stock would, in effect, have a significantly reduced duty to provide directly for the homeless, authorities such as Westminster, where supply is limited and rents are predominantly above housing benefit levels, will derive little or no benefit from the provision. I remind the Committee that on Second Reading I said that under current legislation in each of the past five years, providing permanent accommodation for the statutorily homeless has taken up between 50 and 60 per cent, of the city council's available housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Westminster city council is committed to making more use of the private rented sector, but is will not be able to access sufficient properties in Westminster to meet the needs of the homeless. On Second Reading, the Ministers—whether by their words or by the movement
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
of their eyebrows—did not dissent from my interpretation that the words "their district" in the Bill did, in the context of London authorities, mean London as a whole. That might be as much as I might reasonably expect, but there is a saying in my constituency: "If a man offers you his word or his bond, you should always take his bond". In the same way, If I have the option of putting my trust in princes or relying on my amendment, I shall, in principle prefer the latter but I will of course, listen to my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I asked whether the words "their district" would under the Bill mean the wider area of greater London. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) will recall his semantic references to facilities and neighbourhoods. Such global distinctions are important. I recall from my classical youth the distinctions that were drawn by a lecturer between the words "perversus" and "praeposterus", which have given rise to the words "perverse" and "preposterous". The lecturer said that "perversus" would be represented by a man coming into the room sideways, whereas if the man were praeposterus, he would enter the room backwards. The definition of the words in the Bill is important and I shall listen with great care to my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the relative position of my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) and myself when I am replying to debates in the Chamber, I am musing on how he can observe what happens to my eyebrows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the problem of relatively limited supplies and high rent levels. Such issues relate primarily to London and I should like to consider the matter further in discussion with London local authorities. I shall make the same suggestion on the related issues raised in amendment No. 525 about where people can be housed within London. In the light of those discussions, we will consider returning to the matter at a later state. The discussions will take place within the London boroughs and between myself and the London boroughs. I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept my assurance that I shall give the matter further consideration and that other amendments need to be brought within that bundle of issues yet to be resolved. In the light of that, I hope that my right hon. Friend will consider withdrawing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of my hon. Friend's extremely constructive response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 518, in page 81, line 9, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and it may reasonably be expected that the dwelling house will remain available for his occupation for not less than 12 months beginning with the day on which the applicant was notified of the authority's decision that a duty under this section was owed to him.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 519, in page 81, line 11, leave out from 'as' to end of line 12 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'will secure that suitable accommodation is available'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With these amendments, we are considering the rather limited duties that apply if a local authority believes that suitable alternative accommodation is available in its area. There are two fundamental difficulties. First, the local authority may take a rather restrictive view of what is suitable. The right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South displayed his considerable classical erudition by referring to perversus and praeposterus. I thought at first that he was referring to his own city council, which would probably qualify for both descriptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that "city council" is a feminine noun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not risk your wrath, Mr. McWilliam, by referring to the former leader of Westminster city council, who might qualify for the feminine version of those words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that some authorities—Westminster might be one—could take a rather limited view of what accommodation might be suitable. Secondly, the authorities might take the view that accommodation was available when the homeless applicant had no realistic prospect of getting it. The obvious example is of landlords advertising property and local authorities therefore saying that property is available. However, some landlords will not accept certain categories of people, such as families with children, people on housing benefit or people of a different colour—sadly, there is still effective discrimination in certain matters—which would result in some homeless families not getting the accommodation that is supposedly available. In such a situation, the homeless applicant could easily fall between the local authority saying that it had discharged its duty because alternative accommodation was available and the landlord not letting the accommodation to them. The amendments would clarify the local authorities' duties and avoid such possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 518 would insist that accommodation should, in principle, be available for at least 12 months. We could have argued for a 24-month period, given the Government's move to change the definition of the responsibilities of local authorities to cover two years rather than one. However, 12 months is a reasonable compromise. Authorities should not be able to discharge their responsibility by placing homeless families, who are not intentionally homeless and are in priority need, in short-term insecure lettings such as six-months assured shorthold tenancies. Not only should they not do so, such a move would be totally counterproductive because, in many cases, it would reproduce the revolving door syndrome with the local authority once again having to cope with applications from the homeless if they are turned out. We believe that the accommodation should be available for at least 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 519 would ensure that people who do secure the accommodation that they are offered and are not left in the lurch. It is unacceptable for a local authority to be able to wash its hands by saying, "We're offering a list of accommodation agencies and advice on how to contact them, and that's it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the clause is incredibly loose. It says that authorities' "only duty"—it even uses the word "only"—is to furnish the homeless applicant.
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"with advice and such assistance as they consider appropriate in the circumstances in any attempts he may make to secure such accommodation."</p></blockquote>
The wording is very loose, and would make the scenario that I described perfectly possible—the authority will simply say, "Here is a list of estate agents and accommodation agencies, and this is how to contact them. We know that accommodation is being offered in the area and that you will be able to afford it, so off you go and find your own." It could well be argued that a local authority could discharge its duty entirely in such a way under the loose wording of clause 155(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is also open to widely varying interpretations in different areas, which could result in some unsatisfactory practices—some authorities will take a far more rigorous view of their responsibilities than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as drafted is totally incompatible with the proper standards of care for homeless people that would be insisted on by any civilised society. I should have thought that the Minister would find the clause not entirely compatible with the view that he has been advancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I cannot convince the Minister with that argument, let me try another line. The wording of clause 155 is completely incompatible with that of clause 161, which sets out how the duty to accommodate homeless people should be discharged. Again, we are talking about homeless people who are in priority need and not intentionally homeless. Clause 161, which I quote for the Minister's benefit, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The authority may perform any such duty—

	<ol>

	<li>by securing that suitable accommodation provided by them is available,</li>

	<li>by securing that he obtains suitable accommodation from some other person, or</li>

	<li>by giving him such advice and assistance as will secure that suitable accommodation is available from some other persons."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The Minister will notice that that is the exact wording that we have chosen for amendment No. 519. I hope, therefore, that he will not find the amendment defective. I hope that he will accept that it ensures consistency in the Bill, and that it is necessary to ensure that there is a proper safety net for homeless people who are judged able to find accommodation other than through the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me respond immediately to the allegation made by the hon. Member for Greenwich that there are parts of the Bill that do not sit comfortably with each other. If, on reflection, I find that there is inadequate precision in the wording, I shall of course take steps to ensure that the Bill is coherent by the time it completes its passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provisions require authorities to adopt a graduated approach to housing problems. Initially, if someone is homeless, threatened with homelessness, or at risk of becoming homeless, he can approach the advisory service that the authority will be required to have available. The advice may enable him to remain in his present accommodation, or may show him how to gain access to a range of alternatives, including social housing, the private rented sector, low cost home ownership, and— in appropriate cases—hostels and lodgings. In some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
authorities a common housing register may serve to match needs and opportunities across the whole range of accommodation. The advice will also explain households' rights under the homelessness legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That person may at that stage apply for assistance under the homelessness legislation. If, after making the necessary inquiries the authority considers the applicant to be in priority need, unintentionally homeless, and eligible for assistance, it will need to consider whether there is suitable alternative accommodation available within its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, the word "suitable" covers a range of attributes including whether the accommodation is of the right size; whether it is, where necessary, affordable for someone on housing benefit; or whether the landlord is willing to take someone with children. If the authority is satisfied that such accommodation is available, its duty is therefore to provide such advice and assistance as it considers appropriate to assist the person in the attempts which he may make to secure that accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities will already be familiar with the private rented sector in their area. As other authorities develop private rented sector strategies, they will become familiar with what property is available and will know where to direct people. They may forge links with particular landlords or accommodation agencies that give them access to a particular set of property. They may also assist people by offering rent guarantees where appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative accommodation provision is a halfway stage between the purely advisory role of authorities and the full homelessness duty. It requires the individual to take some responsibility for arranging his own accommodation, but it also requires the authority to be confident that the accommodation, really is available, and to give the individual the requisite support. Simply handing out a list of advertisements taken from the local newspaper would not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will an authority have to do to discharge its duty? The Minister has just said that handing out a list of advertisements from the local paper will not be sufficient. However, would handing out a list of private landlords be sufficient to meet the duty under the clause if the authority knew that those landlords had accommodation to let?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to make it clear that the local authority must give active assistance to the person to find accommodation. If handing out a list of advertisements from the local newspaper is not fair, I would not expect the local authority to have its own Cyclostyle Roneo list of properties available. Camden has its own forum of landlords and an office to which people go to be given assistance on how to make contact with landlords. The duty must be interpreted actively, not merely in a "this is what we can get away with" sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average length of shorthold tenancies is about three years. Amendment No. 518 would require that the authority should be satisfied that the alternative accommodation is expected to be available for at least 12 months before the authority can rely on the provision. I agree that the authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
should seek to assist the applicant in finding accommodation that is available for as long a period as possible, if only because this would head off any further homelessness application. However, I am reluctant to see expectation of a 12 month letting written into the Bill, as landlords will naturally want to be sure that they have good tenants. Indeed, we are trying to give landlords more confidence to come into the market and make more of their properties available. Assured shorthold tenancies run for a minimum of six months, and many landlords are content to let on a continuing basis. There is no reason why a landlord would want to evict a decent tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will monitor how authorities operate this new provision. Were we to find that authorities were taking an unreasonably short-term view of what constituted suitable alternative accommodation, we could take action. The power under clause 162 would allow us to specify circumstances in which accommodation must be regarded as suitable, and we could use it for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 519 would invalidate the central purpose of clause 155—to give the individual some responsibility for securing his own accommodation with the help of the authority, providing suitable accommodation is available. It places the authority under a duty to provide advice and assistance to ensure that the individual actually secures the accommodation, even where he took no interest in the process, or was hostile to it. It would mean that if the individual took a dislike to a particular property to which the authority had drawn his attention, then he could turn it down, even though it passed all the tests of suitability. It is accepted practice under the existing homelessness legislation that an authority need only make one offer of suitable accommodation, and that should continue to be the case. Therefore, I shall resist amendment No. 519.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 155 will apply where there is suitable accommodation in the market; clause 161 applies where there is no suitable accommodation and the authority needs to take further action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to amendment No. 519, the Minister seemed to be saying that he resisted it because there would then be no onus on applicants to make any effort themselves. Does he accept that in some circumstances—such as when dealing with an elderly person over 80, or with a vulnerable person of 17—it is not right to expect the onus to be on the applicant, and the authority ought to take the lead and do all the work of trying to secure accommodation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I do. We have already discussed at length what we mean by people in particularly vulnerable positions. Some such people will find a route into secure housing in parallel to the waiting list provisions. I do not take the view that particularly vulnerable people who are not able to help themselves should have to go through a procedure that is clearly inappropriate to them. An element of common sense must be applied to the matter, and I have no doubt that, by the use of guidance and the experience of local authorities, that can be brought to bear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to press the Minister a little further on the matter. He said in answer to my final point that clause 155 applies where there is suitable accommodation available in the market, and that clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
161 applies where there is not. Can the Minister explain how, if there is no suitable accommodation available in the Market, an authority will secure that accommodation becomes available for a person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"by giving him such advice and assistance as will secure that suitable accommodation is available"?</p></blockquote>
That is clearly nonsense, because that provision is separate from the provision of local authority accommodation. The Minister must recognise that clause 161 is lifted from the framework of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, which set out a range of different ways in which authorities could discharge their responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is simple. Someone presents himself as homeless to a local authority; the local authority applies a test to see whether the person can be accepted as homeless, and must then see whether suitable accommodation is available. It may be that such accommodation can be secured without the local authority advancing rent guarantees, dilapidation guarantees—or using other such mechanisms to reassure the landlord. In other words, there may be a special relationship between the landlord and the local authority. If the local authority decides that accommodation is not available in that form, it accepts the duty and, under that duty, can provide accommodation from its own stock, from housing association stock, but also from the private sector, where the authority has the appropriate sort of relationship. The landlord may receive guarantees from the local authority—dilapidation guarantees or void guarantees, for example. In other words, there may be a more permanent relationship with the landlord, which may indeed fall under the sort of leasing arrangements that we discussed earlier. So a logical distinction can be drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I will consider the two clauses and if I find that the hon. Member for Greenwich has identified an incompatibility or something that needs to be ironed out, I will not hesitate to put it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister sought to explain the position with reference to the processes that local authorities will follow in order to discharge their responsibility to secure accommodation. Those processes were set out in the 1977 Act in which it was envisaged that local authorities would secure accommodation, by one means or another. The Act stated clearly that that accommodation did not have to be local authority accommodation—it could be accommodation secured from another source, whether a housing association or the private sector. That guidance has been given from 1977 until now, and in any sensible framework it would remain. The problem that the Minister has got himself into is that by including clause 155, which is unnecessary, he has essentially introduced a let-out for authorities that do not want to discharge their responsibilities. They will be able to use that clause to pretend that accommodation is available elsewhere, rather than going through processes that are well established and appropriate—and which we will restore in government, after we are successful at the next general election. The clause is a serious betrayal of homeless people. It provides a loophole that will be exploited by councils that do not want to meet their responsibilities. We cannot countenance that, and I invite my hon. Friends to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already considered amendments to clause 155 this morning, and I listened with interest to the Minister's reply about the purpose of the clause. Despite his explanation, the clause is extremely loosely worded and will be a legal minefield. If he believes that the matters that he put before us should be taken into consideration, they should be definitely stated in the Bill and not merely expounded by him in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the powers of local authorities to deal with homeless people are to be reduced, it is even more important that the clause should be clear. It refers to circumstances where
	<br><blockquote><p>"other suitable accommodation is available"—</p></blockquote>
what lawyers could make of that, I dread to think. When homeless people are turned away because the local authority says that other suitable accommodation is available, their ability to challenge the local authority will be greatly reduced by the vagueness of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister is not minded to write into the Bill what he told us this morning. We all agree with him, but he is relying on wishful thinking about how local authorities' relationships with the private
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
sector might develop. Homeless people will be more vulnerable than they were before, and it is disgraceful that the clause should be vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two amendments deal with a particularly vulnerable group. No doubt the Minister will say, "Of course we intend such people to be looked after." If that is the case, there is no reason why that should not be written into the Bill. People who are disabled and those with mental difficulties may encounter severe problems because of the wording of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start with amendment No. 561. If you are disabled, you will find it extremely difficult to secure alternative accommodation. If you need adaptations because you are disabled, it will be a tremendous problem to be in temporary accommodation and to find suitable accommodation where those adaptations can be carried out. For that reason, local authorities should be required to secure permanent accommodation for people who are disabled and vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many groups outside the House are extremely concerned about the interpretation that local authorities could put on the clause when vulnerable—especially disabled—people are involved. Disabled people need support from informal networks. I know that the Minister said that he believes that local authorities will put people into suitable accommodation often on tenures of up to three years. According to the Bill, people may get into short-term lets, but they will be unable to apply for adaptations for the disabled, which is a problem. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment would cover further groups of people, including those who are vulnerable because of old age, mental illness, handicap or physical disability, because of some other special reason or if there is someone residing with them who has those problems. It would also cover someone who has been detained in hospital for treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983 and is subsequently discharged, and people in the above categories who have dependent children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decent housing is at the heart of community care. Without a stable home, it is virtually impossible to receive adequate community care services. That is why amendment No. 560 is important. The clause, as drafted, will allow housing authorities to offer no more than such advice and assistance as they think appropriate. That is extremely wide and unless it is toughened up, many people will suffer. Of course, they can appeal and go back to the local authority, but why should they have to do that when they already have problems? I believe that the loosely worded proposals run counter to the Government's guidance on the provision of community care services, especially for people with mental illness. I shall quote from the report "Spectrum of Care, Local Services for People with Mental Health Problems, The Health of the Nation", a Government document. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An individual's care plan will include an assessment of housing needs. When appropriate the housing department will provide suitable accommodation. Research demonstrates that provision of a suitable home is an important determinant of a mentally ill person's ability to live in the community. Meeting this need will sometimes depend on the development of more specialised housing provision."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
Therefore, if the Minister, as he said to the hon. Member for Greenwich, is anxious that the Bill should hang together with other legislation, he should look favourably on the amendments. They are supported by groups for disabled people. Amendment No. 561 is supported by MIND—the National Association for Mental Health—which believes that clause 155, as drafted, is likely to discourage close liaison between health and social authorities and housing authorities. Many people with mental health problems will remain homeless and without community care services appropriate to their needs. The amendment would ensure that housing authorities will remain under a duty to secure adequate housing for homeless people with mental health problems and for those who are vulnerable, whether or not suitable accommodation is available in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited night shelters, as I am sure has the Minister, where we have seen that many of those who end up homeless do so because they have mental health problems. If such vulnerable people are not assured of receiving adequate advice and preference, there will be even more homeless people. People whom I have described this morning have particular needs, but the Bill will reduce local authorities' duties to them. It is vital that those matters are dealt with not in a wish list or guidance notes but in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If I were to observe that people briefing Committee members should use the third person rather than the second person—which would avoid Committee members accusing me of all sorts of things— I would of course be suggesting that the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) was reading, and I am sure that that is something that neither she nor any other member of the Committee would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We debated in a previous sitting the extent to which identified people with particular problems should be specified in the Bill. We concluded that we had been seeking to draw attention to the particular needs, but that there was some difficulty in drawing up categories of people who should be included—and, by definition, others who should be excluded. We came to the conclusion—I believe that amendments were withdrawn—that it was the practice that mattered, rather than what was spelt out in the Bill. The same argument applies here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of her speech, the hon. Member for Christchurch said something that I should put right. She said that, like her, I have visited the shelters that are currently provided—indeed, I was at one less than a week ago. As she will be aware, there is a special programme of accommodation, the rough sleepers initiative, which is parallel to anything in the Bill; in the latest phase of the initiative, I announced a programme of further construction of permanent accommodation. The people that she mentioned who were in one of the shelters under the initiative will, if they can acquire the necessary competence, be eligible to move into some form of permanent accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to understand that the phrase "suitable accommodation" has been used for a long time in such legislation, and has a considerable body of case law behind it. It is not as loose as the hon. Member for Greenwich suggested. If it is necessary to define it further, by using orders under clause 162, I shall not hesitate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
My purpose is the same as that of the hon. Member for Christchurch: I am not interested in creating opportunities for local authorities not to pursue their obligations effectively. The question is simply whether the methodology—specifying responsibilities in the Bill— will deliver the results any better. If a local authority wants to discharge its responsibilities effectively, it does not need to have those responsibilities specified in the Bill. If the authority does not want to, it will arguably make no difference to its enthusiasm whether or not the responsibilities are included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have sympathy with the hon. Lady's sentiments, I believe that many of the vulnerable people she mentioned, who could not reasonably be expected to find accommodation for themselves, would, in practice, be likely to have a high priority in local housing allocation schemes. They might well be subject to referrals that are parallel to, and not part of, such allocation schemes—we have already considered those groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the people with the disadvantages to which the hon. Lady referred will not on the whole need recourse to the homelessness legislation. If they fall to be accommodated under it, the local authority will have to provide a much higher quality of advice and assistance to secure the accommodation. That advice and assistance must match the needs of the individual—the authority would not be meeting its duty if it failed to provide such advice. The accommodation would not be suitable, and would therefore not be made available, if someone with a disablement could not live in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady will, on reflection, accept that we shall deal with those matters effectively in guidance. I shall not hesitate to reinforce the guidance or to use the order-making power under clause 162 if necessary. Given those assurances and the fact that we have a common purpose, I hope that she will not feel that she must pursue her amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to tell the Minister that I want to press the amendment to a Division. I can see little likelihood in the near future that the supply of affordable housing will be improved by local authorities, housing associations or in the private rented sector. In view of that, hard-pressed local authorities will have to make difficult decision. There will be cases where, if they can avoid their responsibilities, they will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the legislation is clear, people acting as advocates for vulnerable groups will have a much easier task to persuade the authority that accommodation is not suitable. Because of other provisions in the Bill, I and many groups feel strongly about the vagueness of the clause. The minister says that there is a substantial body of case law, but people presenting themselves as homeless are not interested in case law. They want the duty of the local authority to be clearly spelt out. I intend to press the amendment to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 461, in page 81, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority shall consider under section 155 whether other suitable accommodation is available before proceeding under this section.'.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
This deals with the local connection. We have considered provisions on alternative accommodation. When someone applies to an authority for accommodation, he presumably wants to live in that area. Therefore, it is right that the local authority should find out whether there is any alternative accommodation in its area before it decides to send the person to another authority with which he has a local connection. In such circumstances, it would be onerous and unfair to expect the authority to refer the applicant elsewhere purely because he has no local connection. In other words, there will be an opportunity to find alternative accommodation in the authority where the homeless person made his application. The amendment makes it clear that that must be the first recourse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have allowed a number of Government amendments to pass without comment because they have been technical with no policy implications. However, this is not one of those amendments; it has a serious policy implication. We believe that it confuses two entirely different processes, the first of which is the discharge of the responsibility by the local authority that has a duty to an applicant. That duty might be met in several ways—local authority accommodation, referral to a housing association or assistance to find accommodation in the private sector. The second procedure, which is entirely different, involves referral to another authority to which the applicant has a connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the latter provision applies, the referral must be made irrespective of how the first local authority decides to discharge its responsibility; in other words, before it even begins to consider whether there are ways in which that person could be housed in its area. If that were not done, there would be an absurd and potentially anomalous position. Someone who had no connection with the authority to which he made an application, other than that he happened to be in that authority for perhaps a couple of days when he became homeless, could be judged able to find accommodation in that area and, thereby, not be referred back to another area with which he had very strong connections, and to which he would be perfectly happy to be referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider carefully that the receiving authority of a local connection referral could refuse to accept the referral on the grounds that it judged that suitable accommodation was available in the first authority's area. The amendment will open the door to litigation and challenges from local authorities, which will use this argument to show that they cannot accept referrals from other authorities. The provision is thoroughly bad; it has not been thought through. It will open the door to confusion, anomalies and potential litigation, and I hope that the Minister will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am curious about how people can find out whether other suitable accommodation is available. In area such as mine, where five or six towns are coming together under local authority reorganisation, how does the Minister suggest that the other suitable accommodation to which he referred will be made available? Is he expecting the local authority to keep a register of that accommodation? If so, will he explain how that register will be maintained? Will provision be made from the housing investment
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
programme for such registers? I would assume that such registers would be on-going, because many properties become vacant, are sold, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment is not well thought out. The Minister has not explained how people will find out whether other suitable accommodation is available. We must remember that we are discussing homeless people, who may find it difficult to obtain information through their own resources, because they have no accommodation from which to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is poor and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, I think that it should be withdrawn. The Minister has not advised the Committee how people will be able to obtain information—how homeless people will be advised where they can find the information. Has there been any consultation on the amendment with local authorities or any other body with an interest in housing? I feel sure that, had there been such consultation, the Minister would have told us what support there was for the amendment, so I assume that there has been no consultation whatever on this important amendment. Unless the minister answers our questions, the only respectable way for him to proceed will be to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister may feel that this intervention is not constructive, but I seek to be constructive. I do not expect him to comment on the analogy that I am about to draw. I remember that during the two-and-a-half years in which I served as a junior Minister in the Department of Education and Science, a frequent duty that fell to me was to arbitrate in conflicts between local authorities about whether alternative schooling was available for children in one authority's area who had been sent across local authority boundaries so that the cost fell on a different authority. Some such disputes became intractable and were eventually referred to Ministers. I have no idea whether that situation provides an analogy to what we are discussing, but I serve warning on my hon. Friend that even if the matter that I have described has since been covered by legislation, improbable duties such as that ascend to Ministers and Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of the amendment is to try to give a little more choice to people seeking accommodation. I am surprised to hear that such nefarious consequences would flow from the amendment, because that is not its purpose. If there was a local connection, one would normally expect the person to be referred back to the relevant authority—the base authority, as it were. But if he presented himself to a different local authority, I would presume that that was where he wanted to live— that he had done so with a purpose. The authority would look to see whether there was suitable accommodation on the assumption that that was where the person wanted to live. A second authority could certainly not refuse to accept a referral on the grounds that there is alternative accommodation in the first authority's area. Someone would find out whether there was alternative accommodation because the authority has a duty to advise and assist. The amendment is well founded, but I shall reflect on what has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minster say that someone will know that other accommodation is available? Who is that someone? In my constituency, if a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
person is homeless in Ossett and there is accommodation 17 miles away in the town of Normanton, how will the authorities in Ossett know about that accommodation unless someone carries out research?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before such action takes place, the person who presented himself as homeless will have been accepted as homeless and the local authority would, therefore, be under a duty to provide advice and guidance to that person—as we discussed earlier when debating previous parts of the Bill. No different methodology will be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the local authority must keep a register of what other accommodation is available in its area? If so, will he explain who will fund the extra work of updating the register, which will be a rolling register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's party has tabled a later amendment that would require local authorities to keep a register. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman will presumably be voting against that amendment on the grounds of cost. The local authority must provide information; it will have links with particular landlords and will know where the accommodation is. That is part of its function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear about the matter. It is being made into a fairly big issue. I agree that the amendment was not a technical one, but it was not intended to be particularly controversial. The local authority has discretion to refer on the grounds of local connection. It has no obligation to refer on the grounds of local connection. The proposal is intended to develop the options available to the homeless person on the assumption that there was a reason why he had applied to a certain local authority for accommodation and to see whether he should have the opportunity to find accommodation in that area. Our intention is to try to help the homeless person and not for any other reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have found wrinkles in the proposal of which I was not conscious. I shall reflect on what has been said and if it seems that it contains real practical difficulties that will require me to think further about the matter, I shall not hesitate to do so. For the moment, however, I ask the Committee to accept the amendment on the understanding that I shall reflect on what has been said and, if necessary, return to it at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for offering to reflect on the matter. The more that he does so, the more he will realise that a potential problem exists. The right hon. Minister for City of London and Westminster, South highlighted the scope for disputes between education authorities over the availability of school accommodation. Such disputes could happen about the availability of accommodation in the private sector. It is simply not the case that the amendment would give more choice to the applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the applicant wants to stay in the area and suitable accommodation is available, he will take it, rather than accept a referral. As currently drafted, the clause will open up the scope for a reluctant receiving authority to use the
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
argument about the availability of accommodation to challenge a referral. That is our concern and I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to consider it. When he does reflect on the matter, he will probably see the need for further amendment. If so, we look forward to discussing it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to prevent the possibility of referral to another authority if there is a risk of someone in that other area doing violence to the person who would be referred. The Bill refers only to domestic violence. The amendment would delete "domestic" and extend the definition to include violence in or near the home. It will therefore also apply to people who are not the victim's partner. It would apply to members of the family of an ex-partner, or others with whom the possible victim had had a relationship or had lived with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are quite straightforward. I am sure that the hon. Members on both sides of the Committee can cite examples of people who have been at risk of violence, which is often rather more than domestic. For example, a person might have been involved with a criminal gang who threaten violence if that person returns to their area. Other cases might be the result of racial harassment. Such risks would be a good argument against referral to that other authority. The amendment broadens the exemption to ensure that applicants are not put at risk of violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich may remember that, when discussing amendments Nos. 475 and 476, I undertook to reflect on the concerns expressed then. The hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) now brings before the Committee a series of parallel worries. I have sympathy with the hon. Lady's worry about violence or threats of violence from former partners who may not necessarily be living with the applicant. However, the amendments go wider than that; the hon. Lady is worried about other forms of violence. She will know that legal remedies exist under the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent Department of the Environment research report, "An evaluation of the 1991 Homelessness Code of Guidance" shows that a majority of authorities would usually consider an applicant to be homeless if he could not occupy accommodation because of violence from outside the home. Authorities will continue to have discretion to take account of that. However, I should like to reflect on what the hon. Lady said, together with what was said on amendment Nos. 375 and 476. If we can find

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In line with the earlier definitions that I gave, I fear that I may be regarded as both perverse and preposterous if I speak to the second of the amendments first. Of course, Mr. McWilliam, your order of amendments could not be described as either of those adjectives, as it is derived from the laws of arithmetic and numeracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken before of the need for social housing in the heart of a great city. Even in the halcyon days when the Conservative party controlled 18 out of the 32 local
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
authorities in Greater London, there was more low-income housing in Westminster than in any of the other 17 boroughs. The imbalance between residents and commuters means that employment, as evidence of a local connection, does not reflect accurately everyday life in London. I have said that 750,000 people work in my constituency. Many of those work in the City of London, but that leaves a substantial residue in Westminster and to those should be added the working population of the constituency of Westminster, North as well. That means that an enormous number of households could claim an employment connection with Westminster if they became homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential problem of middle and long-distance commuters is primarily limited to the London area— especially central London. My second amendment, which proposes to delete subsection (1)(b), deals with that issue. If mat is too rich a diet for my right hon. Friend the Minister and if he feels that employment must remain as a condition in the Bill, we shall need to establish a greater hierarchy of conditions than currently exists. The existing unprioritised—I apologise for that word—conditions in the Bill will give some homeless households a choice of where to live—a choice that few other applicants enjoy as a statutory right. Some conditions, such as employment or family residence establish a weaker link than others— for example, the applicant's own present or past residence—and that should be recognised. Prioritisation— again, I apologise for the word—would allow for referral to the local authority with which the strongest local connection could be established. Like the first of my two amendments, amendment No. 567 derives from those thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As with the other amendments that my right hon. Friend proposes, the issues highlighted are most serious in relation to parts of London. Since 1979 all local authorities have administered the business of making inter-authority referrals of homelessness cases in accordance with an agreement drawn up by the relevant local authority associations. That agreement has relied on voluntary co-operation for its effectiveness and has addressed such broad issues as the arrangements for notifying another authority and the procedure for dealing with disputes between authorities, as well as more detailed issues such as a working definition of "normally resident" for the purpose of establishing a local connection. I should like to maintain the principle of a voluntary agreement and I hope that an agreement along similar lines will continue to operate under the provisions of part VII. It will clearly be necessary for the local authorities to discuss such an agreement in the light of the Bill. I should hope that such inter-borough issues that are particular to London can be subject, too, to such a voluntary agreement. As I said, I shall invite the London authorities to discuss the range of inter-borough issues, with the hope of taking on board the point raised by my right hon. Friend. I shall do that as a matter of urgency, as there are important matters to be raised. In the light of my wish to deal with that matter and a range of other issues within that voluntary framework, I hope that my right hon. Friend will not want to persist with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to suggest one further reason why the Minister should not accept the amendments. I understand entirely the concerns expressed by the right

	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South about employment issues in Westminster, but that is not the only authority to have large numbers of employees coming into the area. There are difficulties and an employment link might establish a local connection ahead of other links, which is a perfectly legitimate concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am worried by amendment No. 568, in which the right hon. Gentleman proposes to prioritise—his word—the various criteria but, in doing so, leaves out a critical subsection. The clause states that there can be a local connection if the person.
	<br><blockquote><p>"is, or in the past was, normally resident there, and that residence is or was his own choice"</p></blockquote>
In the right hon. Gentleman's amendment, however, there can be a local connection

	<ol>

	<li>"because he is normally resident there, and that residence is his own choice</li>

	<li>because he, in the past, was normally resident there"—</li></ol>
the two are separated. The words "of his own choice" do not apply to the second item. Is it only because of paranoia on my part that I suspect that the City of Westminster might be seeking another advantage through the deletion of those words? In my understanding of the location of prisons in London, there are no prisons in the City of Westminster, but there are prisons in the surrounding boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham, Lambeth and Islington. Is it possible that the amendment was tabled with the nefarious intention of ensuring that where someone had previously been incarcerated in one of those other areas, a local connection would be established, whereas there would not be one in the case of Westminster? I do not know—I hope that that is an entirely accidental point. However, because there is a worry that the amendment is a way of ensuring that the problems that might otherwise fall on the City of Westminster are pushed into surrounding boroughs, I hope that the Minister will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue that the hon. Member for Greenwich so enchantingly raised is, of course, academic, as I do not propose to press the amendment.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government amendments Nos. 464, 465 and 466 all extend the scope of the review procedure—the internal appeal procedure—to ensure that it covers all the main areas in which the applicant has a substantive right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 464 would ensure that the review procedure extended to decisions about the availability of alternative accommodation. As such decisions will play an important role in determining the nature of the duty owed to an applicant, it is only right that applicants should also be entitled to have such decisions reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be convenient for the Committee if I cover the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch. Amendment No. 541 also seeks to extend the review procedure to the availability of alternative accommodation. As my amendment would achieve precisely the same objective, I hope that the hon. Lady will fee! that it is not necessary to persist with hers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 465 and 466 extend the review procedure to include decisions by an authority to which an applicant is referred, on the ground of local connection, about the availability of alternative accommodation. These amendments merely extend the provisions of amendment No. 464 to situations in which an applicant is referred to another authority. I commend them to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 38, tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich, would give people who were refused assistance under the homelessness legislation the right of appeal to the county court, which would be able to overturn the local authority's decision on one of a number of grounds. When we were designing the new legislation, we reflected on the possibility of opening up that alternative avenue of appeal, but decided not to pursue that course in the light of the review procedure introduced by clause 160. People want an early decision so that they know where they stand. It would be much better for the process to be user-friendly, accessible and relatively informal, rather than the full panoply of the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions will ensure that any grievance on the applicant's part will get a fair hearing, and that there is a proper means of obtaining redress. A high proportion of authorities already have internal review procedures which work well. Our provisions will ensure that the procedures extend to all authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where applicants are dissatisfied, a number of remedies are open to them. For example, the local government ombudsman is a relatively inexpensive and swift form of redress without recourse to the formalities of litigation. That system has just been reviewed. It would also be open to an aggrieved applicant to seek judicial review, although we would expect the court to consider whether the applicant had exhausted other remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that a means of redress should be available, and that it should operate relatively quickly and informally, with a user-friendly ethos. I believe that what the Government have provided delivers a more practical remedy than that proposed by the hon. Member for Greenwich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that we have reached another part of the Bill in which the Government did not examine their proposals closely enough. I could not understand why the right of appeal would not apply to
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
clause 155. When the Minister considered the matter, he obviously agreed with me. I am happy that his amendment will do what is required, but this is another example of the sloppy way in which the Bill was drafted. I am pleased that he has seen the error of his ways, and I am in total agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am less in agreement with the Minister. I believe that there is a case for considering an appeal to the county court, which is the purpose of new clause 38. I hope that hon. Members will bear with me if I briefly outline that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the 18 years—now almost 19 years—years in which it has been in effect, the 1977 Act has inevitably generated a certain amount of litigation, all of which has been pursued through the judicial review route. In many cases, that has produced perfectly sound judgments; in other cases, I have been less convinced of the merits of the judgments, some of which have been reversed on appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the merits of the judicial review procedure, it is by any definition complex, expensive and slow. I am far from convinced that it is right for homeless applicants, who are concerned with something as basic as having a home, to have to go through the enormously complex and expensive processes of the High Court of Justice for their cases to be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the review procedure established under the clause would result in applicants receiving quicker, cheaper and simpler redress locally. In some cases, that will happen. However, as with many other review procedures—such as the housing benefit review boards, which were debated some weeks ago—the decisions of local reviews are not always entirely satisfactory. In some cases, the outcomes of local reviews are frankly perverse; in others, applicants believe that there has been an injustice and want to pursue the matter to a higher court. As that will inevitably continue to be so, there should be a channel of redress to a court which can bring to bear full and mature judicial judgment on the issue without its necessarily having to go through the complex and expensive procedures of judicial review in the High Court. Therefore, new clause 38 would allow access to county courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, there might be a case for amending county court procedures to try to speed up the processes, which are often slow. We have mentioned some of the delays that can occur—for example, in possession actions against antisocial tenants. The way in which county courts handle matters is not always exemplary. However, county courts are certainly more accessible and cheaper than the High Court. Even if we do not go so far as to create a specialist housing court—for which many people have advanced a plausible case—county courts are potentially suitable for resolving such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is good sense behind our new clause, but I understand that the Minister will not accept it. In the years ahead, when people consider the continuing problems of homeless people who do not receive justice having to seek redress in the highest court in the land—ultimately, the House of Lords under the judicial review procedure—they might decide that it would have been better to have introduced the county court appeals procedure that we have proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to clarify the rights of homeless people with regard to reviews. I think that we have established in the Committee that reviews are important, but I am not convinced that the wording in the Bill is exactly right and in the interests of those seeking reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 543 would give more time for reviews to take place. That is important because sometimes those seeking reviews may not be able to do so reasonably within 14 days. There are all sorts of reasons why people will be unable to act on the authority's decision. They could be on holiday or in hospital, and I am especially concerned about people who might be fleeing from violence. Even if they look at the review within 14 days, many people will want extra advice and help on it. We must therefore consider extending the period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be in the interests of a local authority to extend the period because if those appealing against a decision take the wrong route of action, the effects of that could be compounded. We must recognise that some people will have problems, including those for whom English is not their first language and those with mental health problems. The amendment would ensure that everybody got a fair crack of the whip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 542 seeks to ensure that applicants are fully aware of the duty that will be owed to them and that there will be no lack of clarity in the Bill. When applicants are owed a duty following a review, the local authority must notify applicants of that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
Amendment No. 544 is about making clear the reasons for decisions made at the review stage and it is important that applicants are fully able to assess those reasons. There may be subsequent reviews or decisions that must be made and if an applicant refuses assistance or his circumstances change, there could be problems. Applicants need to be able to make considered decisions when reviews go against them and the amendment seeks to ensure that they are fully appraised of the views of the local authority, should they have to take further decisions or actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 547 back up the other amendments. It seeks to ensure that local authorities give reasons for decisions made both for and against the applicant's interests, so that he can take the right action. Applicants can appeal under different clauses of the Bill and their decisions and subsequent actions will be important when they do so. May I give an example of what might happen? A household that needed a ground-floor property may have successfully challenged the local authority that had offered it a first-floor property. If the challenge was made under another clause, and the household was made a long-term offer of a tenancy that was on the first floor, it would be useful for it to be clear to both the household and to the authority the grounds on which the household was turned down initially.[

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 563 would extend the time during which a request for a review must be made from 14 to 28 days. I sympathise with the idea of extending the limit beyond 14 days. I am not necessarily convinced that 28 days is the right length of time. In new clause 38, the hon. Member for Greenwich proposes a 21-day limit in which applicants have leave to appeal to the county court. I will, consider the amendment further in the light of similar periods of notice in other matters of housing law to ensure that we achieve a consistent pattern. If the hon. Member for Chirstchurch will withdraw the amendment, I will consider the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has not persuaded me about her other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They would require an authority to give reasons, whatever the outcome of a review. Clause 160 requires an authority to give reasons where a review is unfavourable. If a review is in the applicant's favour, it will be because the applicant has been found to meet the tests. I am not sure what is to be gained by requiring an authority to tell the applicant its reasons

	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>

I hope that that will meet the hon. Lady's concerns. I therefore invite her to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On the other amendments, I have the impression that the Minister will keep an eye on how the Bill proceeds and on how the guidance notes will work in practice. I hope that he will consider that matter in particular after the Bill is enacted. There could be circumstances in which it would be helpful for people to know the positive and negative sides of a decision and I have given an example of where that could happen. I hope that the matter will be reviewed. In the light of the Minister's positive stance on extending the review period and of the fact that he will consider how matters will turn out when the Bill is enacted, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are extremely important. They relate to the provision of accommodation for homeless households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 525 specifies that accommodation secured by the authority must be within the local authority area unless one of three particular circumstances applies.
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
The first is when the applicant has been subject to violence or the threat of violence within that area, so there is an obvious reason for housing that person elsewhere. The second condition is when the applicant and another local authority have both agreed that the accommodation may be secured within the other authority's area. The third condition is when there is no suitable accommodation within the local authority's area and it has complied with arrangements such as the Secretary of State has ordered for the placing of applicants by an authority outside its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to ensure that a proper and rational procedure is followed when an authority cannot house an applicant in its area and seeks accommodation elsewhere. Placing households in other authorities' areas has traditionally been a cause of considerable friction and ill-feeling between local authorities. The receiving authority often suspects that it will have to incur substantial additional costs, especially in education and social services, to meet the needs of the families who are placed in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also worries about the use of squalid and dangerous bed-and-breakfast hotels and other types of temporary accommodation. Sometimes, the placing of homeless households in such hotels may undermine the efforts of local authorities to control such establishments. That has given rise to much friction. Inevitably, there is also a fear of buck-passing, in that an authority will place a homeless family in temporary accommodation in another authority's area and wash its hands of responsibility as and when the family subsequently becomes homeless again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those anxieties have arisen under the existing arrangements. How much worse are they likely to become under the Government's new arrangements? The local authority's duty will no longer be to secure permanent accommodation, but only to secure temporary accommodation when, as a direct purpose of the Government's policy, there will be an increased emphasis on placing homeless families in insecure lettings in the private sector. The amendment would cover those situations by providing a framework that ensures agreement where possible and regulations that are made by order by the Secretary of State to govern the placing of households in accommodation in another area. It is necessary to provide some order as well as safeguards against the problems that I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 526 would remove one of the most obviously perverse and unjust provisions in the Bill. Subsections (3), (4) and (5) prevent councils from allocating permanent accommodation to homeless applicants. We are not questioning the word "may"; the clause makes it clear that the local authority shall not provide accommodation for more than two years in any three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the implications of such a provision. If an authority uses its own stock, rather than unsuitable and expensive temporary accommodation, to house homeless applicants, it can offer them only a temporary letting for up to two years. I accept that some applicants will reach the top of the waiting list during that time and that their tenancy will be confirmed. However, others will not. What will happen when the two years has expired? The local authority has no power to let those people continue to live in the accommodation. It is extraordinary that, under the Bill, the authority will be required to evict
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
homeless families from accommodation that it has provided for them because the two-year limit has ended and it has no power to continue to house them. That situation is the absurd consequence of the Government's obsession with the single route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in our proceedings, we discussed cases in which direct rehousing will be permitted. The Minister talked about the circumstances in which people would—although homeless—be eligible to be rehoused directly: if they were already on a waiting list and had sufficient points to be given permanent housing, or if they were on a waiting list with, in the famous phrase, "nearly enough priority". In such cases, the Minister suggested—although we remain extremely sceptical about the practical implications of the provisions—households would be eligible to be rehoused directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now consider the scenario in which homeless households have been temporarily housed by a local authority in its own accommodation. Some, as I have already said, reach the top of the waiting list and qualify for their tenancy to be made permanent—or to be given an introductory tenancy on the way to a permanent tenancy, but that is a different issue, and I shall not pursue it. But what about others who, after their two years in temporary accommodation, are nearly but not quite at the top of the waiting list? According to the Minister, people who are in that position when they become homeless ought to be directly rehoused. But under the clause, authorities will not be able to grant a permanent tenancy to someone in that position. The clause says clearly that they cannot offer them accommodation for more than two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to homeless households that have been placed in local authority accommodation for good reason—to avoid waste of money on temporary accommodation—and who are near but not quite at the top of the waiting list when the two years come to an end? The authority will have no discretion to say, "They are nearly at the top of the waiting list. In line with the Minister's judgment, we will allow them a tenancy." The Bill says that they cannot do that. That is nonsense. There is no discretion under the proposed framework for a local authority to confirm a permanent tenancy in such circumstances. In earlier debates, the Minister has talked about the importance of giving local authorities added discretion. There can be no better example than this of the need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework that the Minister is proposing is crazy, unworkable and must be amended—either in Committee or in another place. If it is not amended, it will be a recipe for chaos, confusion, ill-feeling and indescribably inhumane decisions, under which homeless families will have to be evicted from a tenancy simply because they have reached the end of the two-year period, and the authority has no discretion to offer them a permanent home. I hope that the Minister will accept both the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier this morning, I told my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South that I would consider the points that he made about amendment 566, and I referred to amendment No. 525. Amendment No. 525 deals with the situation in which an authority secures accommodation by placing a homeless
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
applicant in another authority's area. Such placements may be undesirable from the point of view of both the applicant—who may not want to be accommodated away from family and friends and the local area with which he or she is familiar—and of the host authority that will take on the burden of providing local services for the applicant. Equally, I recognise that some boroughs face real difficulties because of the nature of the property and property values in their area, as my right hon. Friend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have for some time urged that authorities should make out-of-area placements only if there is no suitable accommodation available in their own area, and that such placements should be made in consultation with the host authority. That is reflected in advice given in the homelessness code of guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues raised by the practice of out-of-area placements are difficult, and they need careful consideration. A balance must be struck. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Greenwich will accept my assurance that I will consider those matters seriously, with a view to returning to the question at a later stage in the Bill. That is on a par with the remarks that I addressed to my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South about dealing with the issues as a single bundle where they rightly belong together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 526 would leave out the provisions that ensure that authorities cannot accommodate homeless households in council-owned stock for more than two years in any three. As the hon. Member for Greenwich admits, the main purpose of the reforms that will be implemented by the provisions in these parts of the Bill is to provide a single route into social housing and to ensure fairer allocation of long-term social tenancies by local housing authorities. Social housing is supported housing, and is intended to meet long-term need. Authorities should maximise the amount of their housing stock that is used to meet long-term needs. Such stock should, therefore, be allocated on secure tenancies through the housing register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities may wish to set aside a proportion of their stock on a non-secure basis as a discharge of their duty to secure accommodation for homeless applicants. That is reasonable, but it would not be reasonable if an authority decided to accommodate a homeless household in its own stock, on a non-secure basis, indefinitely. That would effectively bypass the housing register at the expense of those registered there and waiting for accommodation, and would mean that the homeless household had no security of tenure or other rights normally conferred by a secure tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain to the Committee what would happen to a family that was housed in a temporary tenancy in a local authority's own stock, when the two-year period ended? The family would already have had to pass the clause 155 test, so the authority would be satisfied that no other suitable accommodation was available in the area. If the authority had no leased accommodation or a hostel, what would it do with the family after the two-year period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has pursued that point previously. The question that must be asked is: if the local authority is using its stock as temporary provision for up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
to two years, what are its allocations priorities? If we do not buttress the two-year duty, the local authority could accommodate indefinitely but provisionally. It could evade the legislation and it would not be under pressure to provide allocations from its register, as we want it to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an authority has stock of its own so that it can keep people in short-term accommodation for more than two years, it must consider whether its management priorities are right. Social housing is a valuable resource and should be allocatable on a long-term basis to those with the greatest need. One should reflect on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is important, as it buttresses the two-year duty. Without it, that duty would lose a great deal of its practical meaning. I therefore invite the Committee to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is unsatisfactory, as he failed to answer my question. It is entirely possible under the Bill that a family could end up in temporary accommodation and, at the end of a two-year period, effectively be evicted by the local authority because it was not at the top of the waiting list for a property that met its needs. Even if the authority chose to exercise its responsibility, it would not have a right to allow the family to continue to occupy that property. The authority might not have leased accommodation hostel provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that, in such a case, the authority has got its housing allocations systems wrong, but that is not a satisfactory answer. The problem is that we are trying to deal with one route to housing for a variety of local authorities with a range of different circumstances. The Bill tries to prescribe for all of them in a nice, simple way. My response to the Minister is that the system does not work like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pressures on London boroughs, many of which have allocated houses only to homeless families who were in great priority need, are quite different from those on smaller authorities, such as those in the north. Within my authority, there are massive differences in the pressure for housing in different parts of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A homeless family might be allocated permanent accommodation fairly easily in some parts of the city, but, because of their circumstances, some homeless families need support from their families who happen to live in another part of the city. To be given such support, the homeless family will need to be housed near the rest of the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that, in parts of Sheffield, a homeless family temporarily housed in particular accommodation will not be allocated that property permanently after two years for the simple reason that the council has limited accommodation in the area. The authority will quite properly consider the homeless family's circumstances, give them temporary accommodation and try to rehouse them in a suitable location.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a scenario, which could exist under the Bill, would reflect the various housing pressures in the city. It is surely impossible to predict what housing pressures will be like in two years' time. An authority can make a temporary allocation in the belief that, within two years, it will be able to allocate that accommodation permanently, despite the various priorities and pressures that exist when the initial temporary award is made. However, circumstances change. It is entirely possible that, during that time, a single regeneration budget will have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
agreed with the Government for a particular estate. Families would be moved out of the area, and some properties demolished, which would put pressure on accommodation in particular parts of the city. The housing allocation system will have to take account of that, and waiting times will increase. A local authority that anticipates making a temporary allocation permanent within two years may not be able to do so because of changed circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given only one example of the changes that could occur during the two-year period to prevent a homeless family from being offered the permanent accommodation that they hoped for. The Minister did not say how a local authority could get out of that predicament or, more important, where the homeless family would be housed at the end of the two-year wait. The Minister has failed to convince me. If only one family is left in such a situation, the Bill will have proved to be a complete and absolute failure in dealing with homeless families in a proper and acceptable manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister does not realise the problems that he may create for himself. We seem to be in broad agreement that we should not continue building roads for ever, but many local authorities use short-life properties, particularly those on the routes of new roads. However, road schemes have a habit of disappearing in council budgets, so a decision to put someone in a property on such a route may seem sensible at the time, but you may end up—I and other hon. Members have seen it happen—with the road not being built when you thought, and you do not have another property for the family—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not housed anyone in any property. I certainly have not built any roads lately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam; I am suffering from a tremendous head cold and my clarity has suffered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may happen that a local authority will put someone in a property believing that in two years' time it would be reasonable to house them permanently. As we know, however, it often happens that there is not enough money in the budget to build the road, yet the local authority may have moved the family when it has to house them for only another six or nine months. Any member of the Committee who has had to deal with the problems of people trying to discover when they might be offered reasonable accommodation by the local authority will know just how difficult it is to judge when properties might become available. We heard examples this morning of what happens when local authorities are lucky enough to be given Government grants to undertake major refurbishment. That can throw the hole allocations procedure and planning into a mess. I can envisage many circumstances in which a local authority might, in such a situation, be forced, because of the way in which the Bill is worded, to move a family for perhaps a short time. That is crazy on any rational grounds—in terms of cost, family upheaval and local authority officer time. The Minister should consider carefully the examples that we have given this morning. If the move were for a short time, local authorities—if they had any sense—might choose not to act, and I do not know what the Minister thinks he would do in such circumstances. The measure is a recipe for bad

	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
decision making; short-term decisions will, in the long term, become a waste of time, money and people's energy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Christchurch have said. There is another basic flaw in the Government's thinking on the amendment, which is that people who reach the top of a local authority's housing list will automatically be provided with accommodation that meets their needs by virtue of an authority moving on someone who has been temporarily housed for two years. It is not impossible to envisage a scenario in which a local authority has to evict a family who have been housed for two years because another family have reached the top of the housing list. That other family will look at the property, find that it does not meet their needs and refuse to accept it, and the property will remain vacant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority might go through that procedure on more than one occasion. The family who have been forcibly evicted—or for whom the authority has had to make provision in case of eviction—will possibly be in housing that none of us would find acceptable, as that is the reality under which most local authorities have to work. That family will see their home remain vacant, possibly for a considerable period. That underlines what is an inequity. It will cause distress for the family who have been moved—they will find it impossible to understand why their home has been left vacant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Government, that is the most effective way to facilitate entry into permanent housing for people who have been on local authority waiting lists for a considerable time, but it will do nothing to facilitate entry for such people. It will exacerbate the anxiety, stress and anguish of people who the Government are determined will have no statutory right to permanent housing. It is another recipe for disaster and disaffection, not only for those on local authority waiting lists but for homeless families. The butt of their criticism will inevitably be the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is yet another of the Bill's measures about which the Government—if they will not accept the Opposition's amendments—should think again. All it will do is increase the load of human misery, of which there is surely enough in the housing area without any Government additions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment crystallises a division. The Opposition want to establish and maintain a discrete and separate route into housing for those who fall under the homelessness duty. The Government believe that the process should be integrated, so that homeless people are included with other people on the waiting list, to create a break point at which people's needs are assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks not to refine our concept, but to remove it from the Bill. If it were accepted, a local authority would be able to continue to house homeless people in temporary accommodation for an unspecified period. That would serve neither their purposes nor ours, as it would leave a wholly inconsistent principle at the heart of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are under an obligation to manage their housing stock effectively. Those local authorities which do so will be able to provide accommodation.
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
I believe that the clause is an essential part of the Bill, as without it we would be left with a deep inconsistency. I cannot accept amendment No. 526, and I invite the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall press amendment No. 526 to a Division, as we believe that, as the Minister said, the issue crystallises the difference between the parties. We believe that homeless people should be secured suitable, permanent accommodation. The concept of a homeless person being evicted from regular council housing after two years because of a technicality in the legislation clearly encapsulates the nonsense of the procedure that the Government want to impose. The Minister gave no answer as to why the local authority had to implement that procedure, other than the fact that it is the process that the Bill creates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that, at last December's meeting of the Housing Consultative Council, the representative of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, Councillor Tinnion, who is chair of housing in Gateshead, specifically took up this issue; told the Minister that it was his authority's policy to house homeless applicants directly in permanent council housing wherever possible; and asked for an undertaking that the Council would continue to be able to do so. I understand that Councillor Tinnion was assured that the Government had no intention of requiring the authority to alter its practice. Under the clause was drafted, if any family in Gateshead has not reached the top of the waiting list within two years; the family will have to be evicted from that accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either the Minister accepts that Gateshead's practice is sensible because using its own stock to good effect makes sense—in which case the Bill is nonsense—or Gateshead's practice is wrong, in which case he should not have told Councillor Tinnion that Gateshead could continue it. That illustrates the nonsense of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities are subject to varying pressures but all of them know that, as a matter of good practice, it is better to house people in permanent accommodation than to use expensive and often unsuitable temporary accommodation. The clause will provide a direct disincentive to authorities using their own stock to accommodate homeless people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred to pressures in London. Some London authorities will be unable to secure permanent accommodation through a waiting list to applicants within a two-year period. The pressures will be so great that, after two years, some London authorities might have to choose whether to evict those homeless families that they temporarily housed in their own stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is nonsense, inhumane and wrong, and I shall invite my colleagues and the hon. Member for Christchurch to vote in favour of amendment No. 526. Having said that, I accept the Minister's offer to reconsider the procedures relating to the suitability of accommodation contained in amendment No. 525, and I look forward to his proposals on that matter. However, we cannot agree on the core principle, which in our view is the need to provide permanent accommodation for homeless families so that they will not face eviction at the end of a two-year period under the Bill's over-rigid
