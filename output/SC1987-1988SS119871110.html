	<div class='bill'>Scottish Development Agency Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Scottish Development Agency Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Tuesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.—
	<i>[Mr. Lang.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the motion. I am delighted to know that we shall be continuing next Tuesday. Indeed, the Opposition hope to see the Secretary of State here again on that occasion. It is odd to see him making up the quorum rather than attending to make a speech. At least, I assume that that is why he is here. He might lead the Government Benches, but presumably the Minister of State will be making the speeches. However, we are happy to accept the Sitting Motion and to allow the discussions to proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two announcements to make. Before the proceedings begin, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in this Room. I also call attention to the fact that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>INCREASE OF FINANCIAL LIMIT</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Ian Lang)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides for the Scottish Development Agency's financial limit to be raised, as I believe the Committee will know, from £700 million to £1,200 million. That will provide statutory authority for the agency to provide loans, guarantees and other expenditure from public sources for the carrying out of its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Development Agency was given an initial financial allocation of £200 million raisable by order to £300 million by the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975. It was unusual for such an allocation to be specified for a body in receipt of grant in aid, but the Labour Administration of the day felt that the agency was a new and powerful body with an unusually wide range of functions and it was therefore appropriate for Parliament to have some say in the scale of resources to be provided. The initial allocation was not limited to any particular period, although then, as now, a five-year period was the norm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that the agency has only used £140
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
million in its first three years of operation, the then Labour Administration decided to raise the agency's financial limit to £500 million, raisable by order £800 million, in the Industry Act 1979. That strikes me as being rather like the dying throes of a doomed Government. It was not exactly a blank cheque, as the figure was specified, but it was certainly unsigned, undated and not underwritten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During deliberations on the 1979 Bill, and then again in our 1979 election manifesto, this Government made it clear that, by and large, we were happy with, and would continue fully to support to the maximum extent that financial resources would allow, the agency's activities, but that we would take a critical look at the way it performed its role in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the agency's expenditure in its first three years of operation, the new limits set in the 1979 Act were clearly exaggerated, as experience has shown. In coming to office, therefore, the Government decided to inject some realism into the funding of the agency and to set it on a new, more sharply defined course. The Industry Act 1980 therefore stabilised the agency's long-term budget at £500 million and removed the provision to raise that limit by order to £800 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1981 Act, which was needed to increase the financial limits of the National Enterprise Board for the period prior to abolition and of the Welsh Development Agency, the opportunity was taken to increase the SDA's financial limit to £700 million. That was a realistic limit that would have lasted until 1988 but for the discovery that certain expenditure had been wrongly excluded by the agency from expenditure counting towards the limit. Because of the necessary retrospective changes, the agency is now expected to reach its financial limit before the end of this financial year, hence the need for this legislation. The Bill therefore seeks to set a new limit of £1,200 million. The Government feel that it is realistic, given the present spending patterns, and should provide the agency with sufficient funds for about the next five years. At that time, it would obviously be right to have another fundamental look at the agency against the then prevailing financial climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I suggested, that was the sort of review period envisaged by the previous Labour Administration when the agency was set up and we see no need to change the position. Had we not drastically altered the course of the agency it would be not be the success story that it is today. It has changed out of all recognition since its inception in 1975. Even when it was clear that the agency could not spend the unrealistic amount that it was initially allocated, the previous Labour Administration raised its financial limit even higher in 1979. The Government have brought some sense to prevail both in the funding of the agency in 1980 and since and in how it carries out its functions. Since then, under the guidance of the present Administration, the agency has become much more receptive to the needs of the market and more conscious of the need to include, at all levels, the private sector in the economic development of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's speech was a continuation of the Second Reading debate a dreary

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
reading of a brief by the Minister without any life, feeling or any great sense of purpose. The membership list shows that 90 per cent. of the Tory Members who represent Scottish Constituencies are members of the Committee. Throughout the duration of this parliament, the only way that the Government will be able to get any legislation through the House by always having 90 per cent. of their Scottish Members on the Government Benches. While this Bill may not last over long, I am sure that others will last a long time. Some of the Tory Back Benchers who object strongly to serving on the Select Committee—I look at the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, the hon. Gentleman is straying rather far from the context of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strayed only to make a point that on later Bills, some hon. Members will find the task of being in Committee all the time very irksome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is the first Scottish Committee since the general election, it might be kind to say how sorry we are not to see many former Tory Members who, during the last Parliament, sat on Committees of this nature, especially the poll tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will notice, Mr. Lamond, that the Opposition have tabled no amendments to the Bill. It is basically a one clause Bill to increase the borrowing powers of the SDA. For those of my hon. Friends who are new to the House it is the tradition, if not the order, of the House that the Opposition cannot increase public expenditure. Therefore, Mr. Lamond, you would not have permitted an amendment that raised the borrowing powers of the SDA. Nor would the financial resolution passed by the House allow such an amendment to be tabled. Clearly, it is not the wish of the Opposition to reduce the borrowing powers of the SDA, which would have been the only alternative and the only amendment that could have been tabled to this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we welcome the Bill, although we must be aware, as I know the Minister and Conservative Members are aware—unlike the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon)—that the Bill does not in any way increase the spending power of the SDA. It allows it to continue spending money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It allows it to continue spending money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it is allowing the SDA to continue in business after the end of this financial year, rather than giving it extra money to spend. If we did not introduce this Bill, and if the SDA reached its maximum borrowing powers at the end of this financial year, next year it would have great difficulty in continuing at all. The hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), despite his minsterial silences these days may wish that to happen. Organisations such as the SDA intervening in the economy do not appeal to the hon. Gentleman's free market philosophy, and he does not support it. Hitherto I could tempt the hon. Gentleman to intervene in my speeches, but I assume that now he is incapable of doing so, and therefore some of the pleasure of these Committees will have gone. Perhaps the Secretary if State will allow the hon. Gentleman to have a go of he so wishes. Certainly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
however, we welcome ability of the SDA and we want its work to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a stand part debate on a one-clause Bill. It is not, and never has been, the Opposition's intention to filibuster. On Second Reading, all that we were seeking was a reasonable debate on the Scottish Development Agency one that went on for slightly longer than two hours, as most Second Reading debates do. It was the Government who attempted to stop the debate on that first evening. We made no attempt to filibuster, as the times of speeches made by Opposition Members show, it is not our intention to filibuster or to delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives us, within a reasonably short time span, an opportunity to look at the work of the SDA and what it does within the limits of the clause, the Opposition have consistently supported the Scottish Development Agency. We have always believed in it as a vehicle to help regenerate the Scottish economy. It was a Labour Government who first introduced the Scottish Development Agency, and steered it through Parliament, against opposition from the Conservative party. As it is the Labour party's creation, therefore, we wish to see it do well. The Government have not always given it the support that they now appear to be giving it in words, if not always in deeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past few years the Government have made two attempts not to stop the SDA but to curtail it by setting up reviews of its work. They were looking for grounds to limit the powers of the agency. The inquiries were issued with firm instructions to assess the agency on free market criteria. That was done first by the National Audit Office, in the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on investment activities in the Scotland Development Agency, and secondly by the Scottish Office Industry Department in the 1986 review. Despite the fact that both those reviews appear to have been set up to try to produce reports that would give the Government the opportunity to limit the scope of, and possibly ultimately to destroy the SDA, they both gave the SDA more than a clean bill of health. They actually gave it a clear welcome and said that it was doing a remarkably good job in Scotland, although I accept that there was also some criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDA has wide-ranging powers. It can give loans, provide equity finance, offer professional advice and rent factory accommodation. It is, of course, involved with the environment. In my constituency it is about to be involved in improving the environment in parts of Castlemilk. It has worked with local authorities and public finance. I wish that the Government would stop talking about the SDA and private finance as if somehow that were the only area in which the SDA was involved, and pay due regard to the work done with the SDA by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has only to look at the GEAR operation in the east end of Glasgow, at the garden festival and at the Scottish exhibition centre to realise where local authorities have been involved with the SDA. The Minister is nodding now, but he was very reluctant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman refers to my speech on Second Reading, he will find precisely that tribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have read the Minister's speech again and again to find something interesting. I accept what the Minster said on that one occasion, but his hon. Friend the Member for Stirling consistently attacks local government and refuses to pay any regard to the work done by Labour-controlled local authorities with the SDA. I also accept that the SDA has worked with private investment. The three organisations working in partnership have done a remarkably good job, often without much support from Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a company director of the Glasgow international jazz festival, which has SDA involvement. It did not receive much help from the Government. We shall be interested to see how much help the Government and the SDA give when Glasgow is the European City of Culture in 1990. So far the Secretary of State does not appear to be giving it much encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, the SDA has played an important role in the environment as well as in industrial development, but under this Government it has moved gradually away from large-scale intervention in traditional industry towards what might be termed a more subtle approach. It changed its policy largely because it perceived a political threat from this Government. It saw the possibility that it would be closed down if it continued to operate in the same way. It has, therefore, increasingly seen its role as filling in the gaps where the private sector has failed. That has created some problems in terms of the SDA's ability to invest risk capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am very unhappy about the collapse of the company in Livingston yesterday, I in no way condemn the SDA's role in that company. It is exactly the sort of role the SDA should be playing—putting in risk capital and taking risks in order to create new jobs and new industries in Scotland. The two reviews that have been carried out show that the SDA has been effective. One review said that in net terms the SDA's factory building programme alone had created 5,000 to 7,000 jobs between 1980 and 1985. The review body concluded that they were jobs that would not have come to Scotland if the SDA had not been operational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cooper and Lybrand report for the review body said that the SDA's industrial functions created additional output for Scottish industry totalling £275 million between 1981 and 1985. It also said that the SDA had been responsible for the creating of 10,000 jobs between 1981 and 1985. It suggested that the SDA's investment and advisory functions in schemes in which the agency was not the sole or main backer probably created a further significant increase in jobs. In additions and this is role that my hon. Freind the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr Dewar) spoke about—it has done a good job with Locate In Scotland, in which it is in partnership with the Industry Department of the Scottish Office, to attract overseas investment to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome all of that. The Minister sometimes
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
tries to suggest that we do not. We welcome any investment coming into Scotland that will help to solve the problem of unemployment. However, we do not accept that the creation of 300 to 400 jobs somehow solves the Scottish unemployment problem, which is what the Secretary of State sometimes tries to suggest. It has not created as many jobs in the electronics industry as the Government like to suggest. There has been a slight increase, but it has not taken up anything like the loss of jobs areas. To put the SDA into some sort of context, it is worth quoting the report of the Industry Department's report to the Secretary of State. In its conclusion it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On balance we are satisfied that the Agency over the first ten years of its existence has borne out the expectation that considerable benefits would flow from such a body in Scotland. The Agency has adapted successfully to the… regional and industrial development under the present Government.… The Agency's high standing with the Scottish business community and financial institutions, the generally supportive attitude of the local authorities, and its reputation beyond Scotland are also indicative of the Agency's performance. We have been particulary impressed by the flair and imagination which have characterised the Agency's approach to its role…"</p></blockquote>
Having said that, the Government, while mouthing a lot of support for the agency, have not always been prepared to give it the financial support that it requires. In 1979–80 the SDA had a budget of £134 million in real terms, at fixed 1986–87 prices. The estimated out-turn budget for 1987–88 is £ 131 million. In real terms, the budget has fallen by about £3 million or 2.2 per cent. That may not seem a large sum of money, but it is a fall at a time of unemployment, when the need for investment is considerably greater than it was in 1979–80. Only in 1982–83 did the Government allow the SDA higher funding than it had in the last year of Labour rule, and that was the run-up year to a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDA has had a cut in the money that it receives from the Scottish Office. We should be aware of that and therefore take the Minister's remarks with a great pinch of salt. The SDA has been a success. I only wish that the Government would recognise that it would have been much more successful if it had been given the freedom and the money to operate on a much wider basis. The Government recognise that the interventionist policies of the SDA work. The Minister has said that. If it operates better by allowing the free market to operate, as is the case in Scotland, why does he not allow it to run? Why does he not give it more resources and the ability to take risks and invest in Scottish industry? That is a difficult question for the Minister to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might discuss the SDA in relation to regional aid generally. It is part and parcel of the whole package of investment in Scotland—which includes the Highlands and Islands Development Board, the Scottish Development Agency and regional aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it is necessary to clarify who controls regional aid in Scotland. I should be grateful to learn that. The argument about who controls regional aid is a continuing one. The Secretary of State said in a radio interview that he had complete control over regional aid in Scotland, but in winding up the debate on Second Reading the Minister of State said that the Secretary of State had control of the administration of regional aid but that the overall financial policy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
was a matter for collective Government responsibility. Last weekend both the Secretary of State and Lord Young of Graffham—the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry—were at a conference at the Gleneagles hotel, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden. My hon. Friend asked Lord Young who was in charge of regional policy in the United Kingdom. Lord Young made it absolutely clear to my hon. Friend that his Department was the lead Department in regional aid although, naturally, the Secretary of State for Scotland was consulted about and had a say in such matters. However, Lord Young made it quite clear that regional aid was his concern and that he was the boss in these matters. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the Secretary of State boasted that there would be a £24 million increase in regional expenditure in Scotland next year. That is a an interesting figure, but let us examine the facts. Last year, the Scottish Office spent £205 million on regional aid, as the old regional development grant system wound down and the new one came in. This year the allocation was £120 million. That is a considerable cut. In the first six months of this year, the Industry Department of the Scottish Office has so far spent £46 million on regional aid. If that trend continues for the second half of the year—we shall, know when we see the figures next April—only £92 million of that £120 million will have spent. It appears, therefore, that the £24 million figure about which the Secretary of State boasts is no more than a roll-over of his Department's underspend in this financial year. No new money will be allocated. Money will simply be taken from this year and rolled over into next year. The Government's new criteria for regional aid are much tighter than even they envisaged. As a result, the Industry Department of the Scottish Office is finding it extremely difficult to spend the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State were really serious about increasing Scottish Office expenditure on regional aid, he would allocate that £24 million not to regional aid but to the Scottish Development Agency and perhaps some to the Highlands and Islands Development Board to ensure that their work could be expanded. The Secretary of State has not said how he will spend the money. Perhaps that is what he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is what he will do with it because it is clear that the criteria for regional aid now used by the Government make it extremely difficult for them to spend in full the very much reduced amount of money that they are prepared to spend.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has said, we do not oppose clause 1 as such, although I and others have some reservations about the SDA's role. The real question is the use to which the loans and guarantees are put. Sometimes the SDA is regarded as a pot of gold for developers, and its task
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
is seen as that of making speculative development less speculative. I do not complain if it enables firms to develop land that would not otherwise have been developed, provided that an overview is taken as to whether that development is in the public interest. The SDA has made finance available to clear land and to carry out landscaping after development has taken place, but there is more to development and to the regeneration of the Scottish economy than that. The SDA shoud rather act as a banker in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that there has been tree planting on the south side of Edinburgh. That is all very nice but it is not exactly the way forward for the redevelopment of Edinburgh's south side. I have some reservations about the role of the SDA in Leith, because it seems that the SDA's loans and guarantees have assisted in the yuppiefication of Leith. It is very nice to see Leith being brought up to date, land being cleared, development taking place and houses being built, but what has happened to the Leithers who used to live there? Many were decanted out in the 1950s and 1960s because of the appalling housing conditions, but the houses that have been built to replace the old properties are to highly priced that it is difficult to see how those who once lived there and want to return will ever be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not begrudge people housing or the modernisation of areas, but the SDA should take a global view of what has been happening in some areas where renewal has been carried out. The interests of all rich and poor, with and without incomes should be looked after. I understand that the SDA may become involved in a major development in my constituency which could provide an attraction of United Kingdom if no European proportions. I hope that if the SDA becomes involved it will have regard to the interests of those who live in the area and who will have to take the good things and the bad things associated with such a development. Urban renewal requires a public interest and I regret that the SDA appears to be moving away from that role and towards simply providing money for developers who wish to set up in Scotland, without looking at the longer-term interests of the communities in which development will take place. The SDA has acted as an interested spectator rather than a director of operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the SDA may become involved in the Wardie bay development off the coast of Edinburgh. Clearly the developers concerned have a major interest, but so do the people of Edinburgh, and not just those immediately affected who used to live on the coast but in future will live inland. Everyone in Edinburgh will be affected and I hope that the SDA will accept that it must look not merely at the interests of the developers but at the interests of those who are affected in all sorts of ways. It is very nice, for example, in Leith to see the growth of so many wine bars. That is very nice indeed—if one can afford to spend one's time in them. It would be nicer still to see low-cost public sector housing to rent or to buy. That would also help to regenerate these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the money that was invested by the Scottish Development Agency in the Scottish exhibition centre and I hope that the same spirit will be shown as and when the conference centre in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Edinburgh comes to pass. The conference centre is beginning to rival the hole in the ground in Castle terrace as an attraction for tourists who come to see what is not there. I hope that in its capacity as the provider of public funds the SDA will be able to make funds available so that the east coast may also have a large exhibition centre. When the SDA addresses itself to that, I hope that it will also address itself to the vexed question of who is to pay the running costs of the centre—should it ever be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not quarrel with the SDA's role of providing funding for projects such as the Glasgow garden festival. Although flowers are nice and the festival will provide a great deal of attraction for Glasgow, I wonder whether that is the right way to start regenerating the economy, in Glasgow or anywhere else. It is high time that the SDA, working along with the Scottish Office, took an overview as to where development is to take place within Scotland, and the sort of development that we want. On Second Reading, the Minister of State said that he regarded the SDA as an engine of change. It seems to me not so much an engine of change as simply a vehicle for providing money to private developers from time to time, without any overview, general strategy or direction on where the Scottish economy is going or should be going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known that one of the differences between the Opposition and Government is that the Opposition would like a great deal more direction, overview and strategic view of where development in Scotland and the United Kingdom should be going. It is to be regretted that, while we welcome the increase in the amount of money that the Scottish Development Agency will be able to lend or to guarantee, there is not attached to that a suggestion that it should get into the driving seat, rather than act as an interested spectator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While clause 1 is very welcome, a number of reservations about the operations of the SDA have been brought to light, and will be highlighted in the future. It should not be regarded as simply a source of money to enable people to set up profitable operations and then, perhaps, to go away once they lose their profitable interest. The SDA must realise that there is a public interest, but I greatly fear that public interest is taking second place. I hope that both the agency and the Government will address themselves to that in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been said that this is a one-clause Bill. Certainly, what is controversial about the Bill is not so much what is in the clause as the absences from it. I was struck by the shuffling of paper when the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was explaining the distinction between an annual budget on the one hand and an overall financial limit on the other, which is what we are discussing. I take it that the shuffling of paper indicated some dissent on the Government benches. It reminded me of the shuffling of paper during the Secretary of State's address—or lecture—at Gleneagles on Thursday night, when it certainly indicated a substantial degree of dissent among his audience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
In a way I should be pleased if there were no distinction between the question of an overall financial cumulative limit and an annual budget contribution. In that case, the amendments that stand in my name on the Order Paper, which the Chairman in his wisdom has decided not to call, would have stood a good chance of being in order. The amendments would have attempted to increase the annual contribution from the Government to the Scottish Development Agency to £150 million. I strongly suspect that the agency would have vastly preferred its annual budget contribution to be raised by some £60 million to £150 million, rather than having the rather technical device of the cumulative financial limit being raised to £1,200 million. That distinction was evidently not appreciated by some of the Government Back Bench Members during the Second Reading debate, but it is none the less important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party has two major questions about the SDA's current position. The first concerns the agency's overall budget. Whatever sophistry the Minister may deploy to explain that the agency's overall budget, including its own resources, is not declining in real terms, there can be no argument with the statistics given in the parliamentary answer on 4 February this year. That shows that the annual contribution during the Government's period of office has declined from £104 million in real terms to £89 million in real terms, a decline of some 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened in the Scottish economy during that time to justify such a dramatic decline in the Government's annual funding? It was, of course, that the Scottish industrial production on a 1980 base is still below the 1980 level—just over 98 per cent. of what it was when the Government came to office. I should have thought that that would have been an argument or recipe for vastly increasing the funding to the agency, which has as its prime task the restructuring and regeneration of the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems a remarkable policy that, when the Scottish economic condition grows more severe, the Government's response is to make less the funding to that major agency for reconstruction. A substantial degree of explanation is needed from the Minister. We also want to know why, on Second Reading, he claimed that in recognition of the increased effectiveness of the SDA the Government would increase its budget. The fact is that the Government's contribution to the Scottish Development Agency has declined over the Government's decade in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second and major criticism that my party levels against the Scottish Development Agency at present—or at least against the straitjacket in which the Government have placed it—is of the direction of funding from the agency. When the agency was established 10 or more years ago, some 25 per cent. of its total funding went towards risk equity investment within the Scottish economy. Now the figure has declined to a paltry 2 per cent., in terms of net investment within the overall budget. I find it difficult to believe that an agency can engage in a restructuring of the economy unless it is prepared to engage in equity investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, in the Second Reading debate, assured us that, having established its valuable role
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
through Locate in Scotland in attracting inward investment into Scotland—against the wishes of the Minister and the Tory Back Benchers on the Scottish Select Committee but now with a general consensus on the valuable role that it plays in attracting inward investment—the emphasis of the SDA would move increasingly towards nourishing indigenous investment in the areas that the Scottish Development Agency has targeted as having enormous potential within the Scottish economy. The Minister mentioned food processing and quality engineering. I would argue that there are other areas of potential in the Scottish economy—for example, biotechnology, educational supply, transport equipment, mineral resource development, timber and other sectors where the Scottish economy has a natural advantage. The Scottish Development Agency, is actively studying those areas in sectorial analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a limit, however, to the purpose of identification of areas of growth if the agency is restricted, and is in a strait jacket, in what it can do about the identification of these sectors. While political prejudice prevails against the agency's intervening to bring private investment into those areas, it will have to play a marginal role in what was originally its most important task economic restructuring. We cannot restructure the Scottish economy on a net investment budget of some £2 million a year. Yet the Industry Department review of the Scottish Development Agency published last year shows that, on the whole—and one has to look at these matters on the whole—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I said—and I hope that he will remember this—that the Government's policy for containing inflation and creating a climate that would reduce taxes and corporation tax was in fact more important to the development of business than all the work done by the Scottish Development Agency. That is surely proven by the fact that Don Bros, in my constituency, has just established a new enterprise in Forfar, where there is no assistance whatever. Had it gone a few miles down the road to Dundee, it would have had massive publich assistance, including assistance from the SDA. But the company believes that the future lies in having this new plant close to its other establishment, and that is the most profitable way to run its business. That is more important that the relocation of resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
defend the splits now appearing in the Conservative Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways it is rather more honest to say that one does not want the Scottish Development Agency at all. If those views were expressed honestly, the hon. Gentleman would joint his erstwhile colleagues on the 1980 Select Committee and no longer be in this place. I am sure that the Minister will want to persuade him that the Scottish Development Agency has a valuable role to play in the Scottish economy. The point that I was pursuing was the direction of Scottish Development Agency investment, not whether it should exist at all. My particular point was the need for equity risk investment in the Scottish economy led by the Scottish Development Agency in the area that it has identified as having tremedous potential for growth. Can the Minister back up his claim that the agency will now turn its attention to the development of indigenous companies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments would provide that the Government's contribution to the Scottish Development Agency's budget would be increased to not less than £150 million, an increase of £60 million in the years to 1990–91. That would by my calculations, allow a reasonable degree of investment and the generation of about 30,000 jobs. In the review of the Scottish Development Agency carried out by the Scottish Office Industry Department, it was calculated that the net subsidy would enable it to invest in the economy at about £1,000 a job. That is a remarkable bargain. It seems, therefore, all the more remarkable that the Minister is not willing for the agency to increase its interventionist role and engage in serious equity investment in the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart said that the Labour party was particularly solicitous of the Scottish Development Agency because it was its creation. Of course, that applies all the more to the Scottish National party because it was at our instigation that the Labour party established the—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear dissent on the Conservative Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the Scottish Office Industry Department proposal for which the Minister is responsible. It conducted a review of the Scottish Development Agency that looked at the background to its establishment. Page 17 of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The formation of the Agency was in part a response to the growing impact of North Sea oil on Scotland and political debate on the use of oil revenues, with strong nationalist pressure for them to be spent within Scotland. Indeed the Government's announcement of the setting up of the Scottish Development Agency came first in a White Paper on North Sea oil in July 1974."</p></blockquote>
It is useful to make the comparison with North sea oil funding, bacause even the dramatic increase that my amendments propose in the funding of the Scottish Development Agency would amount to only 1 per cent. of oil revenues in what is a bad year for total oil revenues to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP is keen to support the Scottish Development Agency and was much involved with its birth. However, that support should not blind us to the fact that, both in respect of its overall budget and, importantly, the direction which the Government will allow it to follow in its activities, the agency is not currently equipped to tackle the real problems of the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Catchcart (Mr. Maxton) raised the matter, I must tell you, Mr. Lamond, and the Committee that I am delighted to be participating in these proceedings, particularly under your Chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can my hon. Friend the Minister of State tell us more about the thinking behind the figure of £1,200 million as opposed to any other figure, either above or below that? As I understand it, the current figure of £700 million was to last for two more years—to 1989—and so I am not sure why we are considering such a Bill in 1987 rather than in 1989. I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister referred to some expenditure being wrongly counted. I say that with trepidation, as I suspect that he will tell the Committee that the mistake was made when I was the industry Minister. However, I should be interested to hear what my hon. Friend has to say about how the figure of £1,200 million has been reached. On the face of it, that represents a substantial rate of increase over what was originally intended in 1981. That is against a background of strong arguments for believing that, over the next few years, the SDA's requirement for external finance—as against its total activity—should be declining rather than increasing. It is, I believe, generally accepted, that the agency should be a catalyst for economic change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speeches from the Opposition Benches, both in Committee and on Second Reading, consistently held that the effectiveness of the SDA should be measured solely by the total amount of finance available to it. But that is not so. In principle, it is perfectly possible for the SDA to be much more effective with less finance from outside. How effective a catalyst is it? It is particularly encouraging that, for every £1 of its industrial investment, the SDA now attracts £13.50, compared with only £5 two years ago. That is a tribute to its effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the SDA becomes increasingly effective, it should be able to charge more for some of its advisory services, as the review group recommended. My hon. Friend might not wish to respond to that point of detail now, but may prefer to write to me. However, there has been concern about overlap of advisory services between different agencies—for example, the SDA, the National Enterprise Trust, local authorities, and so on. Another possible area of involvement for private finance is the SDA's role as an industrial landlord which, as was noted on Second Reading, is relatively much greater in Scotland than that played south of the border. Historically speaking, there have been good reasons for that. However, if we consider the industrial property market and likely trends in Scotland—which are currently very favourable—it would seem probable that the move from the SDA's property marketing to make a much more commercial role, which has been successful, could be followed by the involvement of more private finance in that particular operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise those matters not in a spirit of criticism of the SDA although, as Opposition Members have said, there are criticisms. Indeed, I have criticised its involvement with certain companies, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State knows. But no organisation can possible be perfect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I hope that my hon. Friend, in winding up, will say something more about the detailed justification for the proposed figure, in the light of the points about how the SDA is developing which, broadly speaking, I support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an unusual debate in that I sense that although it is a Government Bill, the enthusiasm for the agency comes from the Opposition rather than from the Government. I would guess, or more than guess, that two of the Ministers are unhappy about the Bill and about the expanding role of the SDA, and that the Government Back Benchers—certainly the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn)—would be against expanding the role of the SDA and, indeed, for cutting it back. I sense that there is a further hesitation because of the review of regional policy going on in Government ranks led by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, where it is difficult to imagine the SDA coming unscathed through that review. Some suggestions are about the further cutting back of regional development grant. It is well known that there are those on the Government Front Benches and Back Benches within Scotland who believe that the answer to Scotland's problems is more Thatcherism. One suspects that at some future time further doubts will be put forward about the role of the SDA in Scotland. The Government are trapped because they know that such initiatives coming from south of the border would be unacceptable within a Scottish context. Therefore we have considerable ambivalence behind the proponents of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to explore a little further two issues that I raised on Second Reading, and would very much welcome from the Secretary of State or the Minister some clarification about the relationship between the Secretary of State, Locate in Scotland and the SDA. To what extent is the SDA or Locate in Scotland free agents in terms of developing industrial or commercial initiatives? To what extent are those initiatives developed without the intervention of Ministers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly interested in that because of the Health Care International proposal in Clydebank which, as I said on Second Reading, is easily the largest capital project with which the SDA has been involved. The jobs that are involved in that are in many ways a welcome addition to the economic infrastructure of my area. Considerable anxiety and, indeed, outrage has been expressed with regard to a couple of aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the very odd situation where sums of between £2 million and £5 million are rumoured as about to be spent to remove asbestos that was buried by the SDA and the local district council. It was intended that it should remain on site, the reason being that there was no other site within an enterprise zone. That seems a very strange use of public money. One would have thought that the easiest thing to do—and it could have been done very simply in this House—was simply to have adjusted the boundaries of the enterprise zone at no cost to the public. But, to satisfy our bureaucratic rules, we shall have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
considerable expenditure of money to the considerable apprehension of the local citizenry who know that site and who ask why, of all the sites that exist it has to be that site. When the SDA suddenly emerges after years of secrecy in the development of such a proposal, there is indeed mystery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with that proposal, I should like to raise the question of the relationship between the Secretary of State as the Health Minister for Scotland and the Secretary of State as the Industry Minister for Scotland. In this case, the SDA produced the largest proposal with which it has ever been involved, and that proposal had to go to the Secretary of State as Health Minister within a six-week period. It beggars credibility that the Secretary of State, in his capacity as Industry Minister, did not know about the development of that proposal some time ago. I think that the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), when he was Minister responsible for industry and education would have known about that proposal. I think that the previous Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), would have known about that proposal being developed. What has happened in this case has been an embarrassment of roles. Certainly no one in my locality would have believed that that proposal was being judged fairly from a health viewpoint as to whether it was damaging the National Health Service, given that there must have been encouragement of the project by the Secretary of State in his capacity as industry Minister. It is not a question of being against those jobs but of the way in which public business is conducted in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to raise one other issue. Again, it relate to ambivalence in this area and to an issue which I raised on Second Reading the lack of clarity about grass roots stimulation of entrepreneurship, community business or co-operatives, and so on. What has frequently occurred in Scotland, as in the United Kingdom generally, is that we have used the definition of small business or small industry on too large a scale. One used to talk about a small business as one with fewer that 50 employees. Every Government initiative is supposed to be about bringing jobs to hard-pressed areas such as those that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) represent, but so many Government or private enterprise initiatives fail to provide jobs for the people who most need them. They constantly provide jobs for outsiders to the area. I believe that a significant contribution can be made by local co-operatives, local community businesses and local small businesses of an orthodox kind. The necessity is for workers, either from the local authority or from the SDA, to work in the area for a period of years to stimulate the idea that it is a location in which small industries can survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I dare mention the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart in this respect, we know that the Castlemilk area was a disaster in terms of design. It was a dormitory area of 40,000 people, a one-use area not regarded as having any kind of local economy. There is a need to be clear about the role of the SDA in this respect. It has been nervous about going down to the neighbourhood level because it is not clear whether its political masters would consent to the spending of money in that way. At the same time, Ministers have been highly critical of some local government initiatives to spend ratepayers' money on stimulating local economy, not seeing it as the job of local authority. I should be surprised if clarity emerged, but I would welcome an attempt at clarity from the Minister to make it quite clear that he would also welcome the stimulation of grass roots enterprise and how that is to be accomplished between the local authorities and the SDA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come into this debate as Member for a constituency which has received considerable benefits from the presence of the Scottish Development Agency and also after the contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) as a displaced Leither and probably yuppified in the same way as that port has been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the SDA in context and I shall use the example of my constituency to throw some questions at the Minister. The north-east of Scotland is one of the more successful parts of the country, mainly because of its contribution to the oil industry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
in this country. Nevertheless, there have been some damaging side-effects. First, the loss of development area status has made it very difficult for traditional industry to expand or even to function in some respects, the whole area has been affected by local inflation. Property costs have gone up, employment costs have gone up and we have seen a considerable loss of jobs in the traditional industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The growth of one industry has soaked up some of the jobs lost, but the other side of the coin has been apparent in the past year with the crisis in the oil industry and a considerable downturn due to the drop in world oil prices. As a result, the oil industry cut back considerably on its expenditure, causing difficulties not just for the industry itself but for those dependent on it. It is estimated that there are about three jobs in the non-oil sector for every four jobs in the oil sector, and jobs were affected right across the spectrum. The usual barometer of the local taxi trade was an interesting indicator of how seriously the non-oil sector was affected. The SDA has played a role in that situation—a smaller role in the past, but in 1984 it opened an office in Aberdeen, and since then we have seen a considerable increase in activity from the agency. In 1983–84 the total agency expenditure in my constituency was £478,000, which increased rather dramatically, after the opening of the office in Aberdeen, to £2,190,000 in 1984–85, and £6,199,000 in 1985–86. In 1986–87 it has dropped back a wee bit to £23/4 million. In the process, the agency has made a considerable contribution to a number of fairly crucial developments in the Aberdeen area. I may mention the Aberdeen conference centre and the hyperbaric centre. The agency has provided advance factories and industrial units, it is involved in the riverside development, and is also closely involved in a new project looking at the development of Aberdeen for the next century Aberdeen 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDA is playing a curcual role in my constituency. If I must raise any fears from what I have heard in the Second Reading debate and in this debate, they would relate to the Government's attitude and that of some Conservative Members to the SDA. We have already heard from the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that he would prefer to do without the Scottish Development Agency. I take it that he will vote against the Bill when the time comes, if that is his honestly held view. That attitude by the Government severely affects the confidence of the agency. It is being forced, in many respects, to keep its head down. There are considerable signs of nerves in the agency as a result of yesterday's announcement of the losses which it may make on its investment in the Livingston project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency must be allowed to take risks. Any entrepreneur, and any entrepreneurial agency investing in industry and job creation, must take risks. If it goes for the safe options every time, it is not doing the job that it was intended to do. Any commercial bank could do that job. The agency must look at new fields and become involved in new areas. The agency's investment in my area is a good example of areas of new technology in which it has become involved for example, the hyperbaric centre, which required a considerable injection of public funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
We must also look at the co-operation between the agencies and local government. I am fortunate in my area, as is the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), with the North-East Scotland Development Agency, which is a department of Grampian regional council, of the earliest local authority job creation agencies, and one of the most successful. This week NESDA has promoted an enterprise in London called the Grampian Initiative as part of its programme for bringing jobs to the Grampian area. The co-operation between the North-East Scotland Development Agency and the SDA has been crucial and needs to be developed and encouraged. Attacks from Conservative Members and occasionally from the Government on local authorities do not help that process. They are counter-productive to the enterprise of job creation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that I have severe worries for the future of the north-east of Scotland, particularly for my own constituency, as we see a downturn in the oil industry, oil in the North Sea becoming more expensive and a decline in exploration. We had a taste of what the 21st century may mean for us with the oil price crash last year. In that decline, which we have seen in other parts of Scotland in traditional industries, the role of the agency could be even more crucial in looking for new areas of investment and new job opportunities. In that crucial role which the agency performs, it must be encouraged from all sources, not least by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. Further points have been raised which I shall try to answer. Perhaps I may also comment on one or two of the general themes that have emerged from the dabate. In all the contributions from hon. Gentlemen and from my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) there has been a welcome for the Bill. I noticed how it seemed to stick in the throats of some hon. Gentlemen to welcome a measure which the Government have brought forward and which provides the agency with a financial limit which will enable it to operate effectively for the next five years or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member of Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) raised again the question of the Government paying regard to the work of local authorities with the agency. I pointed out to him in my intervention on Second Reading that I paid specific tribute to the involvement of local authorities with the agency. If he seeks to divide my hon. Friend the Member for Sterling (Mr. Forsyth) from me, I need only point out in the presence of my hon. Friend the launching of the East End Executive the other day, which is a joint public and private-sponsored organisation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That must have stuck in his craw, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—to act a the successor organisation to GEAR. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), representing a broad, ecumenical approach to this matter, was also present on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the case of Integrated Power Semi-conductors. I was pleased to note that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
supported the approach of the agency on that. We are entirely at one. It is a proper role for the agency that it should be willing to invest in projects in which there is some measure of risk. Indeed, the involvement of the agency is very often the trigger that enables other venture capitalist organisations to be persuaded to become involved, as was the case with Integrated Power Semi-conductors. A receiver was appointed yesterday by the Bank of Scotland, which holds the standing security, and it is possible at this stage to view the situation with guarded optimism. A number of interested bodies are exploring the possibilities of future developments involving that company, and I hope that it will be possible to retain both the jobs and the technology. In answer to the point raised a moment ago by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) about nervousness about the SDA's investment function, the potential loss to the agency has been fully provided for over the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart also raised the question of the Treasury review and suggested that it was somehow intended to limit the agency. That is not the case. The review was part of the normal process of reviewing public bodies from time to time to ensure that they are pursuing the right objectives and giving value for money. Although quite a number of recommendations emerged from that review, the vast majority of which are either being implemented or under close consideration, the Treasury saw no need to recommend any change in the powers, functions or purposes of the agency. The conclusion that the hon. Gentleman draws that it was a deliberate intention to limit the agency's activities is in no way justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the review that is in question, but the criteria and specification given to it, which caused some anxiety in that there appeared to be an attempt to insist that the review be carried our against a certain set of criteria on commercial operation only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misled himself. There has been no specific divergence in the terms of reference for that review from any comparable review of any other similar body. All such bodies are reviewed from time to time. I am pleased that the agency emerged relatively unscathed from that review and also that a number of constructive points are being implemented which will be to the continuing benefit of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the agency's budget is concerned, the hon. Gentleman should stop gnawing at this bone because there is no meat on it. The gross budget of the agency—I shall come to the net budget in a moment—has increased in real terms since the last year for which the Labour Government was responsible. The hon. Gentleman was quoting 1986–87 prices. In 1978–79, at those prices, the gross budget of the agancy was £124.9 million. Last year, the agency's out-turn expenditure was £130.9 million. That is an increase of 4.8 per cent. The estimated out-turn for the current year is £130. I million. Before I go on to the net budget, I must point out to the hon. Gentleman that he claimed that only in 1982–83 was the budget higher than under the Labour Government. That simply is not the case. Expenditure has been higher in every year as compared with
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Labour's last year, 1978–79, with the single exception of 1981–82, when it was at the same level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) was right to say that the net budget has reduced, as we have always made plain, but far from regarding that as a sign of failure, I regard it as a sign of success. It means that the investment programme and the use of the funds given to the agency under its operating budget by the Government have been so increasingly effective that funds have been recycled within the agency and the agency has been able to fulfil its role without having to call on the taxpayer for ever-growing funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that at the end of 1986 the former chief executive of the Scottish Development Agency remarked that he could use twice the funds available on potentially viable projects. Was he wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come in a monent to the hon. Gentleman's point about the funds that the agency could use, but I should point out to him that the 1986–87 budget which, as I said, ended up at £130.9 million, was provisionally set at £136.4 million. It was precisely because the agency did not, by the end of that year, have sufficient investment projects to use up those resources that the budget had to be reduced. There is no evidence that the agency is short of funds for investment, and it will not say that that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absurd for the Minister to suggest that any director or other official of a public body relying upon Government funds for its mere existence will, either privately or publicly, tell Opposition Members of Parliament that the Government's policy is wrong and that much more could be done if there was more money. They simply will not do that. There have been some half-hints of that privately, but they will never do it publicly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever half-hints the hon. Gentleman thinks he may have picked up by reading inferences into something that somebody has said, I can tell him that the agency is not constrained by a lack of funds from embarking on an investment programme. The example that I gave him underlines that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) referred to the Leith project. I was sorry that his support for it was so grudging, because it has been an effective integrated project by the agency. It was started in 1981 and has created some 73 new extra factory spaces involving 67,333 sq ft; it has had 6,600 property and business inquiries from the public; it has helped to create 250 new businesses; and it has attracted private investment of some £16.2 million. I should have thought that that was an extremely useful project which has considerably enhanced Leith's prospects as well as raising the general quality of the environment in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman than moved on to Glasgow, and suggested that the garden festival was somehow equated with the regeneration of Glasgow's economy. The garden festival certainly has an important role in stimulating further environmental improvement in Glasgow. It will provide 800 to 1,000 jobs during the construction and operating phases and it will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
encourage further investment and new economic activity in the area, as well as attracting large numbers of additional visitors to Glasgow and, indeed, to Scotland. It therefore has a great deal to be said for it, but to characterise it as the sole agency contribution to the regeneration of Glasgow is quite extraordinary. Presumably the hon. Gentleman is aware of the long and successful history of the GEAR project, now happily continued through the East End Executive. Presumably he is also aware of the Merchant City initiative, the St. Enoch's centre and a wide range of other investment and renewal projects in the city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At no time did I suggest that the garden festival was the SDA's only project in Glasgow. Indeed, I welcome many of the projects with which the SDA has become involved. I was simply highlighting one or two of its activities which I thought were worthy of examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has now clarified his position, under a certain stimulus from me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that the Minister now accepts that this was again a triple function of the Scottish Development Agency, local authority and private finance because that was not the impression left by the Prime Minister when she visited that area recently. The Prime Minister did not even bother to inform the Lord Provost of Glasgow that she would be 400 yards from Glasgow city chambers. She left the impression that this was what private investment could do in an inner city area—and that neither the SDA nor the local authority had anything to do with it at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a travesty of what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said during her visit. I was with my right hon. Friend for most of that day and I know that she fully recognised the role of public bodies such as the SDA, as well as local authorities and the private sector in partnership, in developing those areas which have so successfully transformed Glasgow to the extent that it is now one of the most encouraging cities, in the United Kingdom, in terms of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, brings to mind how much we miss our great and good friend, Sir Albert McQuarrie, on such questions. He was known as the Buchan bulldog—and rightly so. In characterising the hon. Gentleman, it is difficult to think which dog is most appropriate. I settle finally for the Dandie Dinmont because it is difficult to tell which way it is facing. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the shuffling of paper and talked about confusion between the financial limit and the budget. Had the hon. Gentleman's amendment been unstarred and had you selected it, Mr. Lamond, that would have been my first criticism of it. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would impose budgetary restraints, restrictions and controls on the agency by amending a clause which relates not to the budget but to the financial limit. He suggests that the agency's budget should not only be controlled but that not less than £150 million should be channelled to equity
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
investment in the Scottish economy. In other words, he suggests that nothing should go into environmental work, land renewal, building factories, advisory services or promotions and surveys. I give way to the hon. Gentleman to allow him to clarify his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is quite clear. I suggest a total Government contribution to the agency of £150 million for the years up to 1991 and that the additional funds of £60 million which that would provide should be channelled into equity investment in the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say why he is satisfied with the agency's role in risk investment when the net investment figure is now just around £2 million—some 2 per cent. of the agency's total budget? We accept that the agency's other areas of involvement are valuable, but the agency's role of equity investment—which was once a quarter of its total budget—has now been reduced almost to nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman thinks that the purpose of his amendment is to increase equity investment, among other things, but that is not how I read it and I doubt whether that is how it would have been read had it been enshrined in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman recalls the figures that I gave on Second Reading, he will be aware that the agency's investment programme has increased over the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the importance of indigenous industry and here he has touched on a better point. The budget of Locate in Scotland amounts to only 4 per cent. of the agency's total budget. The remaining 96 per cent. is largely geared towards Scotland's indigenous industries. Although inward investment is extremely important because of the transfer of technology, a broadening of Scotland's economic and industrial base, the attraction of new management techniques and the more secure employment opportunities associated with that, indigenous Scottish business should be the agency's main area of activity, whether this be through the small business division or through its investment, property or other functions. For example, the small business division deals almost exclusively with indigenous companies, as do most of the agency's area initiatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's argument which, if I understand it correctly, claims that the SDA is not restrained by lack of funds but by lack of available projects. If that is so, why do not the Government offer the SDA the £150 million, as suggested in my amendment? Then, if on its criteria the agency cannot find the projects in which to invest, no damage will be done. The trouble is, I suspect, that so many areas in the Scottish economy require investment and the agency would find so many projects to invest in that the Government are not prepared to come forward with the funds at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I the hon. Gentleman had ever had any involvement in responsibility for controlling expenditure in the Scottish economy or the United Kingdom economy, he would be well aware that of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
importance of maintaining overall control of public expenditure. It is to the Government's credit that we have managed to expand the overall budget of the agency since the last year in which the hon. Gentleman claims that his party was so important in the affairs of the agency, so that it is now spending more in real terms than during that year. That has been achieved within our overall success in bringing public expenditure under control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood made a number of interesting points. First, I should clarify the point about the mistake that led to the need for this Bill rather sooner than was expected. It was during 1985–86—a year that will be familar to my hon. Friend—that the National Audit Office discovered that expenditure on surveys and promotions was wrongly being treated as administrative expenditure. That meant that for that year £10.5 million and in the current year £13 million had to be reallocated, which has meant that the agency has got closer to its financial limit sooner than expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked my view of fixing the limit now at £1,200 million. The answer is that, given the general net spending pattern—in other words, the net contribution that has had to be put into the agency through the Government—over the last few years we should reasonably expect such a figure to keep the agency in funds for the next five years. That does not in any way anticipate the agency's gross budget, nor what the net budget need be. As I said earlier, if the agency continues its present successful trend of investment and realising profits on past investment, it may be possible for the net budget to reduce still further. My hon. Friend will agree that that would indeed be a sign of success on the agency's part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making the point that somehow the success of the agency is due to its net budget. Surely it would be much better to look at what is happening in the Scottish economy, at the level of unemployment and industrial investment generally, and to say, "Look, the agency needs more money to do the job that it is supposed to do", rather than, because it is making some money in one area, go in for a cost-cutting exercise in other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are back to the old argument. The hon. Gentleman thinks that the only way to judge the success of a Government body is by the amount of money that the Government put into it, and that the more money that the Government put into it the more successful it must be. That may be the way to Socialism it was certainly the effect of Socialism during those terrible years from 1974 to 1979 but it is not the way in which we judge our success in our custodianship of taxpayers' resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood raised the question of whether charges for advisory services should be increased. That point emerged during the Treasury review and is under active consideration. It is an important point because the role of the advisory services will be a growing one. A great deal of work has already successfully taken place on the revision of what may be called hardware in terms of factory construction over previous years. That role may
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
reduce in relative terms and the provision of advisory services may grow in the years ahead. It is therefore important that there should be an adequate charging process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister therefore confirming the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> article which saw the role of the Government and the SDA as much more that of providing advisory services rather than regional development grants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is widening the matter. We are debating clause 1 of the Scottish Development Agency Bill. I am telling him that the role of the agency, now that it has so successfully provided so many factories in so many areas and will continue to do so, may switch in emphasis towards the provision of advisory services. That is a right and proper role for it. So far as factory building is concerned, where the private sector will not build and where there is a need for factories certainly, the agency will continue to have a role, seeking to involve the private sector wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) acknowledged the role of the SDA in his constituency, and rightly so. That is indicative of the support given by the agency to indigenous industry, helping it to adapt and to take advantage of opportunities which emerge in the course of economic change. The agency has fulfilled a useful role in Aberdeen and continues to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr Worthington) claimed that enthusiasm for the Bill was only on the Opposition side. I wish that the hon. Gentleman could summon up a little bit of enthusiasm for the greatest achievement of the Locate in Scotland activities in bringing Health Care International to his constituency with the creation of 4,000 jobs. We have repeatedly asked him to make his position plain on that, but I have to say that it still looks to us like an enigma wrapped up in a riddle. He asked to what extent the Government are involved in the activities of the agency. The position here is that the Government are involved in giving the agency overall guidelines and priorities, in discussing its budget with it and in controlling the overall level of its budget, but otherwise the agency is free to pursue its own statutory functions with as little interference from Government as possible, because part of the point of having such an agency is that it can act within certain parameters at arm's length from Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister explicitly when he as a Minister, or his predecessor, knew about this project and commented upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman has tabled a parliamentary question on that, which I think has been answered. If not, I expect that it will be answered within a very short time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only answer that I have received, as seems to be the tradition with the Scottish Office, was to a question that I did not ask. I know perfectly well when the Secretary of State received the formal proposals about the HCI initiative. That was in June, when it was publicly announced. I have been

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman asks another question he will get an answer to it, so I suggest that he does so. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has an overall role both in industry and in health matters. His role in health matters is a separate and quasi-judicial role which he fulfils with very great care and thoroughness in arriving at what I regard as extremely sensible decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was curious about the exact status of Locate in Scotland. It is a joint body operated by the Scottish Development Agency and the Industry Department for Scotland. It also has to co-operate very fully and closely, as it does, with local authorities in the new towns. That is really the secret of its success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as asbestos clearance is concerned, I was not clear whether the hon. Gentleman thought that it was a good or a bad thing that asbestos lying around in his constituency should be cleared away. The agency has an unlimited delegated authority, so there is no need for it to come to Government to seek approval for that kind of role in improving the environment. It liaises with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure that adequate safety precautions are taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about SDA support for community business and the stimulation of grass roots business. This is an important area for the agency because the assistance to very small businesses is very important. I particularly welcome the development of enterprise trusts, with which the agency works very closely. We now have more than 40 enterprise trusts around Scotland. They are bringing local experience, local knowledge and local resources in terms of cash and advice to bear on the development, growth and establishment of new businesses, with access to all the resources of the Scottish Development Agency. That is a very good delivery mechanism and one that we should greatly encourage. The agency also supports community business and is involved in that as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister has been able, since Second Reading, to announce the funding of the PRIDE and DRAW schemes, which are very important small businesses in the rural areas of Scotland. A number of hon. Members were concerned about that, as he will remember. Is he in a position to tell us about the new framework of the schemes and their criteria, and also whether former applicants, whose applications were abortive because of the exhaustion of funds, will be able to receive priority in the new round of applications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannnot spell out the fine details of the schemes, which are still being negotiated with the agency. I can, however, confirm what I announced about 10 days ago, that the new scheme will come into being and will have a three-year duration at this stage, with funds of £5 million, and it will have the name PRIDE as did one of its predecessors. I can also tell the hon. Gentleman that existing outstanding
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
applications will be given priority in the handling of the new scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For small businesses under the local SDAs, particularly under the local enterprise grant scheme and the urban projects programme, the number of applications and grants has varied over the years, but what has been remarkably consistent over the years and has shown no evidence of SDA or Government involvement has been the level of applications approved. The percentage has been between 25 per cent. and 26 per cent. every year since the Government came to power. Some cynics—I would not number myself among them—might suggest that, because of the way in which the Government limit the money for the SDA, the SDA has been operating a quota system so that however many applications were received there would always be only 25 per cent. or 26 per cent. approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, of course, wrong. He may be interested in some figures that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland gave in answer to a question from the hon. Member for Garscadden. The total of applications for grant aid for the development of rural area workshops, the programme for rural initiatives and local enterprise grants for urban projects, together with development grants to enterprise trusts, the training employment grants sceme, and the better business scheme, rose from 1,169 applications in 1983–84 to 11,671 applications in 1986/87. That represents a dramatic and impressive development of those schemes and proves the need that they met. Approvals rose from 208 in the first year mentioned to 3,455 in the later year. In absolute terms, that is a remarkable and dramatic expansion; in percentage terms they rose from 17.8 per cent. to 29.6 per cent. I do not know where the hon. Gentleman gets his average of 25 per cent. per year as the figures do not bear that out.

The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan asked a rhetorical question, comparing the budgets of 1978/79 and today and asking what had happened over that time. I am happy to tell him. What has happened is that public expenditure has been brought under control. Inflation has been reduced from an average of 15 per cent. during the five-year period when his party was propping up the Labour Government, to a present level of around 4 per cent. Industrial relations have improved beyond recognition. Overseas debt has been repaid in large amounts. The public sector borrowing requirement has been reduced. The nation's budget has been almost balanced. Taxes have been reduced, both corporate and personal. The leverage in the agency has dramatically increased so that the investment leverage is now 13.4:1. Job losses in manufacturing industry have reduced at a substantial rate. New jobs have been created at a remarkable rate. Growth is averaging more than 3 per cent. per year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. Before the Committee disperses after this long and arduous sitting, we wish to pay tribute to you for your firm and fair custodianship of the Chair and also to thank all the officials who have assisted our deliberations, including the police and the badge messengers. I feel sure that the Bill has been fully and effectively debated and will return to the Floor of the House in very good shape.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. May I add my thanks to you and to the 
	<i>Hansard</i> writer? I am not sure whether the 
	<i>Hansard</i> writer managed to get down whatever dog it was that the Minister was talking about. If she has, she has done better than I or my hon. Friends as no one
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
understood the point, but I am sure that, as usual the 
	<i>Hansard</i> writer will have done a very good job. I also thank the police and the messengers who always do such an excellent job in providing services to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
