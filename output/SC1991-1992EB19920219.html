	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Stephen Dorrell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will help the Committee if I provided a brief statement of affairs in view of the voluminous pile of papers circulated to members of the Committee. I apologise for their length, and I appreciate that they are not easy reading. Nevertheless, they deal with an important issue with potentially substantial benefits both for industry and for consumers in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The papers bring together the proposals that were tabled by the Commission at the end of 1990 to introduce future systems for pharmaceutical trade throughout the Community—pharmaceuticals here meaning for human use as well as for veterinary purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that the proposals, which are designed to create and promote an internal market throughout Europe in pharmaceutical products, are desirable in their objectives. We want to work with the Commission and other Community institutions to make the proposals acceptable in detail. There is a clear interest, on the part of consumers in Europe, in having ready access to the benefits that pharmaceutical products can bring. That is why we should remove any unnecessary obstacles to consumer access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are desirable for another reason: this country is a major producer of pharmaceuticals, so we have a clear industrial interest in creating European trade in pharmaceutical products. Thirdly and separately, it will be beneficial to reduce the cost of the regulatory process. An adequate system should not insist that the same questions are asked in all 12 member states of the European Community in 12 equally expensive parallel procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the proposals are desirable. However, it is not a new objective: the Community has made several previous attempts to liberalise trade in pharmaceutical products. I shall not labour the Committee with the detailed history of those previous proposals. The present proposals will evolve the internal market in pharmaceutical products further than has so far been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are built on two legs. First, in the majority of cases, it is envisaged that licensing procedures should continue to operate on what the Commission describes as a decentralised procedure. Under such a procedure, a company will still apply to an individual national licensing agency for a product licence. It will be for the licensing agency to undertake proper checking procedures to ensure that the product is safe, efficacious and of high quality. Once an individual licensing authority has approved a specific application, it will be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
responsibility of the licensing state to prepare a scientific assessment of that product, which would then be made available to other member states of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a company seeking to use the decentralised procedure wishes to extend its product licence beyond the state in which the original application was made, the licence application would have to be submitted to another member state in a form indentical to the first application. The original member state would supply the other member state with the scientific data on which it reached its initial conclusion. Second or subsequent member states have 90 days in which to agree or to challenge the decision that was reached in the original state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the second member state agrees with the licence on the basis of the scientific evidence made available, that is the end of the story and the product will be granted a licence in the second member state. If, on the other hand, the second member state refuses to grant a licence, there will then be a 60-day period during which the two member states that have reached conflicting conclusions on the application have a voluntary conciliation procedure at their disposal. If, at the end of that period, the two member states have failed to reach agreement on the basis of the evidence, the application is referred to Brussels so that a decision on the issues still in dispute can be taken. That is the decentralised procedure for assessing licence applications and for resolving disputes that may arise between member states on a specific licence application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second system is also envisaged. Instead of being based on existing national licensing procedures, it would be based on a new centralised procedure in Brussels. The centralised procedure will be compulsory for biotechnological products, for veterinary products that are used as growth hormones, and it would be optional for high-technology products that involve the use of a new active substance. For compulsory products, companies obviously will have to use the centralised procedure. In the case of high-technology medicines with new ingredients, companies would have to decide whether to use the decentralised procedure or the new centralised procedure envisaged in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, a new central decision-making role for Community institutions envisaged both in the older decentralised procedure and in the new centralised procedure. In both sets of circumstances, the ultimate responsibility for reaching decisions rests with the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is a lay institution and we believe that the Commission is right to stress that decisions on such matters should untimately be made by lay institutions. However, lay institutions clearly need to rely on expert scientific advice in reaching decisions. That mirrors the system that we operate in this country, where medicinal licences are granted by the licensing authorities—that is, by Ministers—but Ministers are advised by the Committee on Safety of Medicines, with the Medicines Control Agency lying behind them too. That system is broadly paralleled in the institutions that are to be established under the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission would be the accountable agency for deciding the issues sent to Brussels. It would continue to rely on the expert scientific advice that it already receives from the two committees that already exist in Brussels—the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, and the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products which deal with human and veterinary applications respectively.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
It is envisaged that those committees will continue to exist, but their role will be dramatically extended. For that reason, the Commission believes that a new institution—called an agency—should develop in Brussels to provide the necessary technical and scientific support to the expert committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee who have read through every word of the papers will know that some discussions are still taking place within the Community's institutions and member states about the precise nature of the agency. The British Government's view is that it is vital for the agency to be seen to be scientifically credible—based on robust science and high quality advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission and member states are right to argue that we do not want an excessively heavy bureaucratic system. That is a proper concern for the margin. However, it is vital that if important decisions about availability of medicinal products are to be made by institutions in Brussels, there should be clear and well-founded public confidence in the scientific creditability of those decisions. We shall pursue that key issue in further negotiations on the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second anxiety about the proposals—which is also set out in the papers—relates to the appeals systems envisaged by the Commission if a company's application is refused, but the company disagrees with the reasons. I remind the Committee that in our domestic licensing arrangements, there is a two-stage appeal system. If a licence is refused, a company can appeal the decision back to the Committee on Safety of Medicines and ask the committee to review its own recommendations to Ministers. If, on the second viewing, the committee retains its original decision, the company may, as a second stage, appeal the decision to the Medicines Commission. This is a separate independent body established under the Medicines Act 1968 which has two functions—to give policy advice on those issues to Ministers and to act as a second appellate body in contested cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European proposals do not envisage that second appeal to a different group of expert witnesses such as we have established in the Medicines Commission appeal stage. It would be difficult for Community proposals to encompass that stage because Community institutions do not have a parallel body to the Medicines Commission in their system. They have parallel bodies to the expert organisations in the form of the Medicines Control Agency and the CSM to the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, and a parallel body to the licensing authority in the form of the Commission. Without establishing such a body, it would be difficult to envisage to whom the second stage appeal could be made. So far as we are aware, there is no substantial demand from other member states to establish a body that could fulfil the function of the second appellate stage. None the less, we believe that this is an important safeguard which we shall continue to explore in negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a couple of other concerns. The first relates to the importance of establishing an effective system of pharmacovigilance of the reporting of adverse reactions to drugs in use. That is not a matter on which detailed proposals are set out in the papers. One wonders how one could escape setting out everything in detail in papers of such length, but that has not been done. We believe that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
is essential to an efficient drug licensing system that there be effective arrangements for pharmacovigilance. It would be absurd to try to set up a system that supplied information to the centralised agency in Brussels parallel to that which we have already established for our own national licensing procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue that absurdity on two counts. First, it would be an unnecessary expense to have two parallel bureaucracies doing the same work of securing information from the same sources. Secondly, and perhaps more fundamentally, every intellegence systems works from having a dense system of roots from which to draw information. A system that draws twice the information is more than twice as strong because it is likely to be more effective the more frequently it is used. We shall argue strongly that the information-gathering systems on which effective pharmacoviligance depends should be the same for both the national and the European licensing systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I last appeared in this Room, there was considerable discussion of the treaty base of the powers proposed by the Commission. The Commission has decreed that future systems proposals fall within article 100A of the treaty, thereby qualifying for qualified majority voting. The Committee may be aware from the papers that the lawyers who are responsible to the Council are not sure whether that is correct. They have advised that the proposals do not fall within the terms of article 100A, but should be proposed under article 235 of the treaty. So far, we have not challenged the Commission's original analysis but, in view of the new advice from the Council's lawyers, we have not yet reached a view on which version is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be interested to know the latest stage of the negotiations. We believe that the Dutch presidency made good progress in resolving differences and ensuring that those that remain are understood and that we have a clearer view of the issues that still need to be resolved. The timetable for further resolution of the issues that was tabled by the Portuguese presidency does not hold out the prospect of being able to resolve the outstanding issues in a short time. There are some very complex and important issues to be resolved, as a look at the papers will reveal. When our turn for the presidency comes, we shall try to make progress. We regard these as important and beneficial proposals, but it is important that the details are right. Indeed, this is more important than trying to meet a timetable that may turn out to be over-ambitious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. Is he satisfied that the distinction between the two regulatory systems—the central agency and the decentralised procedure—is based on individual countries' own procedures running in parallel and that it will be fully understood and not lead to unnecessary duplication and confusion? Also, bearing in mind that the decentralised procedures in the proposals—albeit that arbitration will be available—implies confidence in individual countries' own procedures for drug approval, is he satisfied that markedly different standards of quality and safety will not be allowed under the system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that there is a serious problem with duplication because there is a relatively confined list of applications that are compulsorily allocated to the central procedure. For those that are not, it is for the companies themselves to decide which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
procedure to adopt. I presume that not too many companies will choose to apply through both procedures at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of confidence in the regulatory machinery of other member states, the procedure that the Commission proposes is fundamentally sensible. We are not committed to accept the conclusions of other regulatory agencies. The proposition is simply that when a national agency makes a decision under the decentralised procedure, it is obligated to provide the scientific evidence on which its conclusion was reached to any other member state in which an application is filed. It would then be for the other member state to decide whether the evidence was sufficient to grant a licence. If the other member state concluded that the scientific evidence was not sufficiently robust, we would not be committed to accepting the original member state's conclusions although, ultimately, we are committed to accepting the conclusion in a contested case—of the European centralised authority. That is why it is most important for us to be confident about the scientific effectiveness of the centralised agency, and the centralised authority, in Brussels. Much attention will be focused on that matter in our continuing negotiations on the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are only two models for creating a single market in pharmaceutical products. One would establish a Community-wide version of the Food and Drug Administration, and the other would establish a regime of home-country regulation. The proposed legislation represents an interesting compromise between those two models. As with any compromise, one must ensure that the advantages and not the disadvantages of the two systems are incorporated in the compromise models and that there are no contradictions in it. I have several questions about that matter, some of which I hope to raise later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should appreciate the Minister's guidance about one essential problem. Will not any pharmaceutical company with the slightest sense—and we all know those companies have a great deal of sense—automatically adopt, at least in the first instance, the centralised procedure when it seeks to register a new active compound? That procedure offers a one-stop shopping service, which would save the cost of making multiple applications to 12 national agencies, and—perhaps more importantly from the economic and commercial point of view—it would save an enormous amount of time. The company would gain access simultaneously to the whole single market, and could market its products accordingly. I am not necessarily opposed to that system, but we should be clear about it. Would not that system, in practice, put national drug registration agencies out of business, at least in connection with the registration of new, major, active compounds? Would not the proposed agency in the centralised system, de facto, replace the national agencies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be right to say that the incentive, particularly for important new active ingredients, will be powerful enough for a company to opt for the centralised rather than the decentralised procedure. However, he is almost certainly wrong to draw from that proposition the conclusion that national agencies would be put out of business. The majority of work that a drugs regulatory agency does relates to the fine-tuning of existing drugs and ingredients. Under the proposals, a company would not qualify to apply to the centralised procedure
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
because a new active ingredient would not be involved. My hon. Friend's proposition may be right, but his conclusion is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the proposition may not be as black and white as my hon. Friend suggested. If one sees Brussels as being at the white end of the spectrum, the proposition would be a fairly pale shade of grey—to that extent I agree with my hon. Friend. Companies should have a choice and they may prefer, for whatever reason, to apply through well-known procedures with new ingredients, some of which represent relatively modest advances, and are not therefore like Zantac. That option should continue to be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read articles 19 to 25 in chapter 3, which relates to pharmacovigilance. Will they cover adequately the reporting of reactions to existing drugs and the interactions between existing and new drugs? Is it possible to draw up a system that relates primarily to new drugs without comprehensively studying the effects of existing drugs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 22 refers to regulations
	<br><blockquote><p>"which are brought to his attention by a qualified health care professional".</p></blockquote>
However, that does not appear to contain a legal obligation to convey information. Unless we have a comprehensive feeding through of information on existing drugs, as well as new drugs, and unless the interaction between existing drugs and new drugs is taken into account, there is a danger that we shall be deprived of the whole picture that we need to reach proper decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain cases spring to mind—Halcion, for example, and the experience in Holland as compared with the United Kingdom. It is essential that the full picture is made available. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is endorsing the stress that I made—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) seems to have missed his chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that the hon. Gentleman was endorsing the stress that I placed on the importance of having a single channel of communication for pharmacovigilance information. I agree with him that it is important for the system to draw information through one channel, not through two parallel channels. That facilitates the ability of national information gathering systems to make linkages between information that is relevant to products with national licences and those with European licences. The hon. Gentleman has made an important point about such linkages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last thing that we want is one structure gathering information with respect to national licences and another structure doing the same only for European licences. I could make a speech for 20 minutes about why that is an absurd proposal, and why we shall argue strongly against it. We shall insist that we must have unified information gathering. That would allow the various points that the hon. Gentleman made to be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to return again to the issue about article 235 vis-a-vis article 100A? Is it possible for legal advisers to the Council to say one thing and then for the Council to produce legal advice that says another? That seems a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
contradiction in terms, if the Council's legal advisers refer to article 235, but advice is then issued that contradicts the legal advice given by their legal advisers. My hon. Friend the Minister may be able to answer that problem in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend consider modifying the Government's view on the issue—or should I say non-view? If the Council's legal advisers are starting to say that article 235 might be more appropriate than article 100A, the Government and this country should encourage it. I do not mean to suggest antagonism, but that there should be more openness about what the Commission and the Council are trying to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asked whether it is reasonable for an organisation to seek further legal advice if it does not approve of the first legal advice that it has been given. The issue is very wide—far wider than the Council of Ministers. A long time ago I was taught that, in business, if the first legal advice that is offered is unacceptable, further advice should be sought. If one goes on asking for legal advice, one can normally find support for an opposite point of view. I hope that that answers the first point of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley).

As to the substantial resolution of the dispute, I find myself in a not dissimilar position to that which I adopted when I last faced the Committee. Namely, I am not a lawyer, and I cannot resolve differences between lawyers, which is properly a matter for the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the wider political implications to which my hon. Friend drew attention—in terms of the balance of advantage between article 100a, the treaty base, and others including article 235. Ultimately, however, it is not—at least, in principle—a question to be decided by political advantage, but a question of law. In theory, moreover, it does not even follow that all regulations and directives should be attributed to the same treaty base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Somewhere in the papers—it is difficult to locate exactly—is the suggestion that the United Kingdom Government were sympathetic to amendments that were proposed in the European Parliament. However, many different amendments were proposed. Could the Minister give us more details about which amendments were proposed and which amendments the Government either favoured or disapproved of? In particular, I was wondering about the stipulation concerning environmental risk assessment and safety provisions which the European Parliament seems to have tried to write into the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this week, we had a debate on the Floor of the House about the European economic area and the free trade agreement between the 12 countries of the European Community and those of the European Free Trade Association. How would this proposal relate to that? Presumably, we would be aiming at free trade in medicinal products for the wider European economic area as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will be aware that the Commission has responded to the European Parliament about the amendments. From memory, it has proposed to accept more than 60 of about 160 amendments tabled by the Parliament. That happened relatively recently and the Government will study each of those amendments in detail and make known their conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
We are not in favour of the suggestion that a fourth hurdle should be written in. That is particularly relevant to veterinary products, but potentially relevant to human medicines as well. I believe that the Commission has proposed a rejection of that particular amendment and we would support it if that was its position. We believe firmly that the three-hurdle approach to medicines licensing—they should be safe, efficacious and of high quality—is the correct test for us to apply. Other questions of environmental safety, need and suggestions for a proposed fourth hurdle are properly dealt with in a quite different context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing whether a company which has developed a product that it believes has potential benefits for consumers should have the freedom to market it. If the product is safe, efficacious and of highly quality, in principle, the Government believe that those are the only tests that are specific to its nature as a medicine which it should be required to pass. Of course, it must observe other environmental laws and a wide range of trading laws, but there should be no extra tests that are specific to its nature as a medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I do not know the answer to the question about the proposals for the wider European economic area, but I shall write to the hon. Lady about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin), I note that the Commission has accepted in whole or part 67 of the 155 amendments proposed by the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Parliament, along with the 11 national legislatures of the EC, cannot amend these proposals. An amendment that has been accepted by the Commission calls for the European Parliament to have the right to nominate two representatives to the management board of the agency. I take it that there will be no representative in the agency from any of the 12 domestic legislatures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the Minister's reservations. I fear that that centralised procedure will lead to a cumbersome, bureaucratic system. The MCA employs 350 people, many of whom are pharmaceutical and medical scientists. If our nation employs 350 people in that important work, how many will be employed by the European Community in Brussels? Has the Minister any idea of the numbers involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I told the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) that the Commission proposed to accept 60 out of 160 amendments, and I was fairly close if the figures were 67 and 157.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the power to accept amendments to Commission proposals rests with the Commission, and there is no procedure within the European legislative framework whereby this House or any other national Parliament can go through proposals clause by clause. We could do so under our own Standing Orders, but that would not be part of the European legislative process. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the British national input to the legislative process as envisaged under the treaty of Rome goes through the Council of Ministers, not through the Community's own insitutions of the Commission and Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the proposal for membership of the management of the agency, that is intended to be a Community institution. There will be national representation on the management board, but it will not be in the form of representation from national Parliaments, as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
political accountability of the agency and of the centralised procedure will rest with the Commission and the Council of Ministers. We all have views about whether the political accountability of Community institutions is satisfactory, but that issue falls way outside the debate on the licensing of medicines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) expressed concern that the agency would become an excessively large bureaucracy, and he suggested that, as about 350 people are employed by the MCA, it would follow that a multiple of that number must necessarily be implied in the proposals as employees for the agency. That will depend upon the nature of the beast that emerges from the negotiations. I stressed in my initial remarks that the precise nature of the agency is still subject to discussion. There are differences within the Community and the central institutions in Brussels, and there are substantial differences between member states about the precise nature of the agency that we want to establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody is in favour of an expensive and excessively bureaucratic system. Equally, I am not in favour of a system that is so thin that it cannot secure access to high-quality science. The body will offer advice to the professional committees in Brussels on issues that are of potentially profound importance with regard to the access to the market place of new compounds. We do not want it to be bureaucratic, but neither do we want it to allow into the marketplace compounds that should properly be kept out. A balance must be struck between the proper desire to keep the bureaucracy under control and the equally proper desire to ensure that the licensing system is well informed about the scientific basis of the decisions that are reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned robust science, although I am not sure what that term means. The main concern of many of us about the flow of information is based on the bitter experience of what has taken place over the past 30 years. There can be no assumption that a free flow of medicinal products will be to the general benefit. Many drugs, including Eraldin and Opren, have been mentioned, but perhaps the worse case was Thalidomide, which was still advertised and prescibed for a year or even 18 months after German research showed that it was a deadly drug that had terrible side effects. The research had to be done again in a dreadful, familiar story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the drugs industry is that the engine behind the sale of drugs is the profit motive, and unfortunately, safety has been a secondary consideration. I would not welcome a drop in national barriers—indeed there could be a case for increasing barriers and restricting the introduction of new drugs, because, sadly, many of them have done more harm than good. It is perhaps a minor point, but I would welcome research into a drug to relieve the muscle strain suffered by members of the Committee from having to carry all the Committee papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already apologised to the Committee for the volume of papers. However, the issues are important and I think that both sides of the Committee agree on that. The key information on the subject should be available to the Committee. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman's conclusion about the example of Thalidomide. He said that national barriers between Germany and the United Kingdom led to the product remaining on the market in the United Kingdom after information that should have led to its withdrawal had
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
been made available in Germany. I am not qualified to say whether that is right, but I acknowledge that such an occurrence is theoretically possible under the present arrangements. However, one cannot draw attention to that possibility and argue, in the next breath, that national barriers should be retained, or indeed strengthened. Such barriers to the free flow and application of information within the Community led to the Thalidomide problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), I accept the importance of ensuring that information on adverse drug reaction flows quickly, freely and efficiently. One of the benefits of a centralised system is that information that emerges in Italy would more effectively be made available to drug licensing in the United Kingdom, as part of a proper and efficient system of pharmacovigilance. I do not accept the aspersions that the hon. Gentleman cast on the pharmaceutical industry. There are examples of mistakes and drawbacks—I do not deny that—but the overwhelming weight of the resulting benefits favours the further development of drugs that treat previously untreatable conditions, with less human trauma than in traditional treatments. The benefits of efficient development of pharmaceutical products are clear and tangible and we should provide a system that ensures easy access to them by consumers throughout Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to an earlier question, my hon. Friend rightly said that he did not want a bureaucracy to develop and that the number of people employed by the MCA would not automatically increase because more states are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the principle of liberalisation and the Minister's argument for the need for a centralised organisation that would benefit the drug industry, but I am concerned about the tremendous amount of negotiation on detail. Such negotiation is understandable. However, according to the document issued after the main papers, the Commission do not know the likely work load arising from the new procedures. Unless we are given some idea of the work load involved in setting up a new authority, our function would be endangered: we would be working on theory alone, because the real, practical aspects cannot be measured until the work load is estimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that the arrangements would either be implemented in a rush because the Government wanted to push legislation through thus increasing the danger of mistakes, or delayed, which could also have detrimental effects on the industry and on drug users.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point. He would feel more confident, I think, if I could tell the Committee the agency's job description, the expected number of applications, the number of man hours required to process them, the number of people who would have to be employed to do that, their grades, the cost and the office block that they would sit in. That would all be a great deal simpler and more straightforward. As I have already said, however, one of the major issues that must be settled in the further negotiations—we cannot reach a common position on the proposals until it is settled—is the nature of the work that the agency will have to carry out to support the decisions to be made by the centralised authority in Brussels. Differences exist between member states about the nature of the agency's work and the extent to which the agency will draw on information available through national licensing agencies,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Those issues must be explored in great detail. I agree with my hon. Friend that we cannot allow a proposal to become Community law while it is still fuzzy round the edges about who is going to do what. So far the Commission has agreed that, in order to establish a centralised decision-making authority, support arrangements must be in place to provide in a timely and effective way the information necessary to those who are to make the decisions. That is not in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we must now negotiate with individual member states and with the Commission is how that function is to be carried out. I cannot give the Committee an estimate of the number of man hours involved until we know how the obligation to offer that efficient support will work in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That Minister will be aware that one of the major criticisms of the United Kingdom's MCA is that, through its fee structure, it is financially dependent on the drug companies. Can he give us any information on the financing of the new system? What implications will those financing arrangements have for the present British arrangements? Secondly, on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) about possible problems with drugs, can the Minister tell us how the proposals would affect drug withdrawals? How would a product licence be suspended or a product altered on safety grounds? What are the implications of the new arrangements where problems such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend arise in the case of drugs that are on the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, as regards financing, the hon. Gentelman says that one of the problems of the MCA is that it is financed by the industry. I do not consider that a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it is a justified criticism. I am strongly in favour of a licensing regulatory system. I am also strongly in favour of recognising that such a licensing regulatory system is an inescapable cost associated with the development of modern pharmaceuticals. If that is the case, it is right that the users of modern pharmaceuticals should meet the cost of the regulatory process, which is an intrinsic part of the industry. The financing of the regulatory machinery should ensure that those who use pharmaceuticals pay the costs of pharmaceuticals. That involves production, research into the product and the regulatory machinery that is necessary to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That principle is built into our financing system for the MCA. We shall argue stongly that it should also be built into the European system. The alternative is that taxpayers in general should meet the cost of the regulatory process. I do not believe that that would be right as it would conceal from those who use pharmaceutical products the true cost of the development and marketing of pharmaceuticals. It would make the price signal inaccurate, if I may use economists' jargon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On responsibility for drug withdrawal, that would be a simple question to answer if the licence had been issued by the central authority in Brussels. The responsibility would
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
rest with the central authority in Brussels and the pharmacovigilance information would have to be provided effectively to allow it to carry out that function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where management of drug withdrawal is part of the decentralised process, we believe that that responsibility should rest with the national agencies. Ultimately, if information is available in an acute form which requires prompt action by a national agency—even if national agencies are subject to an instruction as a result of a resolution of a contested case through the decentralised procedure—the national agency must still be free to take effective action to withdraw drugs when up-to-date information suggests that they should no longer be available to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by the precedent set by the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) to ask two questions. They are linked to the same issue of the role and future of the proposed agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to press my hon. Friend the Minister further on the answer that he gave to my first question about the role of the agency. He conceded that the agency was likely to take over the great majority of the registration of new active compounds, but said that the national regulatory agencies should still have a full job to do with secondary registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pursue that matter, because the logic of what he said was that we should seriously consider expanding the proposed role of the new agency to include secondary registration. Pharmaceutical companies would have the option, if they so wished, to choose the centralised procedure for secondary registration which, I believe, often involves the discovery of a new application for a compound already registered for a particular purpose. That means that the indications and doses will change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be considerable commercial and economic advantages for pharmaceutical companies to have a one-stop shopping service, not merely when they first introduce a new active compound but when they subsequently discover a new application for it. A new application is likely to be equally relevant to Denmark, Greece and this country. People will require it and, if it is any good, doctors will wish to prescribe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems that in pursuing the logic of trying to establish a single market in pharmaceuticals, creating the inducements to innovation and allowing for the expansion of the pharmaceutical industry in that context—which we all want and on which these proposals are based—we should consider expanding the role of the agency and the centralised procedure in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to the vexed matter of pharmacovigilance. I am a little confused by what I heard today on the subject and I refer the Minister to article 48 on page 22 of the document that we are considering. It states clearly that the role of the agency will be pharmacovigilance
	<br><blockquote><p>"in particular by collecting, evaluating and making available through a database the information on adverse reactions to the medicinal products in question".</p></blockquote>
Earlier, it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the continuing supervision, under practical conditions of use, of medicinal products which have been authorised within the Community".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member now ask his question please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where the document refers to pharmacovigilance in relation to medicinal products authorized
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
within the Community, that implies that the new agency will have responsibility for pharmacovigilance over the whole range of pharmaceutical products which have already been authorised by the individual national agencies. That implies an enormous burden of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be absolutely clear whether it is seriously suggested that that agency should be taking on that burden because it has many resource and other implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To answer my hon. Friend's first point, he said that the logic of what I am arguing and of a complete internal market would be to centralise all secondary registrations. If the purpose is to create a single internal market, with no barriers, single regulatory machinery and so on, and we are to go the whole way, there is some logic in what he says. The lessons of European history, both recent and more remote, suggest that we should walk before we run. As my hon. Friend said in his first question, that is explicitly intended to be a compromise between a national and a European system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several reasons for that, not the least of which is that one cannot close a system on the 31st day of one month, open a new system on the first day of the following month and expect it to work perfectly. It has to be phased in. Quite rightly, the Commission is conscious of the need to go step by step rather than centralising everything in one bang. As for the centralisation of pharmacovigilance, there may be an oversight responsibility. If I may, I shall reply to that question when I move the motion in a few minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister did not intend to imply that if one country's vigilance structure decided that a product was dangerous, it should lose the right to ban that substance in its own country because the licence was granted centrally? Different countries have different standards and if that happened countries that have been more careful may lose some of their control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also clarify whether medicinal products include diagnostic products? I assume that they do not, but they could have an active role in immunoacids and radio isotopes. I have an interest in that through a company in my constituency. I should be glad to know whether the term "medicinal" includes diagnostic products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told that the answer is that the definition of medicines includes diagnostic materials introduced into the body, but does not include diagnostics that are not introduced into the body. That answers the hon. Gentleman's second point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the hon. Gentleman's first question, I stress the importance of ensuring that pharmacovigilance—the collection of data concerned with adverse drug reactions—must be firmly rooted in the local community. There is no sense in trying to establish a system that requires a Greek doctor to report to a German sitting in Brussels that he has experienced an adverse drug reaction in his patients. It is far more sensible to ensure that that information is collected in a system that is familiar to the local community and which can make the cross-reference to which the hon. Gentleman correctly drew attention in his first question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to whether there is an oversight responsibility resting on the agency, a question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). Whether it exists or not, it does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
contradict the importance of ensuring that the main responsibility for collecting information about adverse drug reactions rests with the local information-gathering system. To seek to centralise it would unjustifiably diminish its effectiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that, rightly, we are considering levels of safety and of efficacy rather higher for pharmaceutical products than we expect from doctors in diagnosing and treating patients? Will he also confirm that even when records of adverse reactions are kept nationally, it is sensible to link them so that research into adverse reactions can pick up what is available within each of the European Community countries? Can my hon. Friend also confirm that the work of those designing, developing and testing new pharmaceutical products is important to animal and human welfare? While trying to maintain controls so that products are not approved improperly, and in trying to ensure that we catch the adverse reactions that may not have been obvious initially, it is important to continue trying to cope with some of the avoidable disadvantages, distresses and handicaps that come from disabling, painful or fatal conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taking my hon. Friend's last point first, I unreservedly agree with him. I shall cite a personal example about which I may have told the Committee before. A few years ago, I suffered from an incipient ulcer condition that would previously have required hospitalisation and surgery. My general practitioner treated me with Zantac, the world's No. 1 drug, which has reduced the patient trauma attached to ulcers almost to disappearing point. That is a clear example of the benefits of advanced pharmaceuticals of which I can give personal witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend correctly stressed the importance of ensuring that proper linkages were drawn within the pharmacovigilance system between what are, on the face of it, unrelated drug reports. I showed my support for that when I responded to the point made by the hon. Member for Caernarfon. As for whether the burden of proof on a pharmaceutical company is greater than the burden of proof on a doctor, that is difficult to answer because the systems and the manner in which in the two operate are completely different. A pharmaceutical product is concerned mainly with the achievement of a particular and predictable mechanical effect in the body, whereas a doctor is concerned with a much more personal relationship. To compare the burden of the tests of competence or the tests of efficacy—that the two factors must apply to each other—seems like being asked to compare chalk with cheese.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The Committee has already heard from me at some length, so I shall be brief. I wish to stress again the benefits that the Government believe are attached to removing unnecessary restrictions to trade in pharmaceutical products throughout the European Community. We did not concentrate on such benefits during question time; none the less they are significant to the British economy because this country's pharmaceutical industry is one of the great success stories in Britain. We tend to hear a great deal about Japanese electronics and German heavy engineering. I wish that we heard as much about the British pharmaceutical industry, because it belongs in the same league as other international success stories. It is an industry in which we have a legitimate national interest in securing easy access to overseas markets for the products of that industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley), I referred to the consumer and the patient securing easy access to properly tested medicines. Such products bring clear identifiable benefits in respect of the improved quality of medical care. The third objective that we must set ourselves is relevant to our discussions about unnecessary bureaucracy and centralisation. It is important that the new system has associated with it the minimum cost that is necessary to deliver effective regulation and licensing. We want easy access to such practices and we want the regulatory machinery to be as efficient as is consistent with effective regulation and licensing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has probably gathered, I do not dissent from his approach to the matter. Earlier, the hon. Gentleman avoided or failed to understand the point about a national regulatory organisation which may want to ban a drug. Could that organisation do so when the drug had been approved by the central European agency? In other words, can higher standards that apply locally overrule a Europeanwide authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I was at fault because I tried to answer the question directly. Clearly, I failed to communicate my answer to the Committee. It depends on whether the original licence was the result of the centralised procedure or the decentralised procedure. If it was the result of the centralised procedure, the responsibility for withdrawing the licence rests with the authority—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am told that the responsibility for issuing the licence rests with the centralised authority in Brussels. We are negotiating the provision, which is relevant to article 36 of the treaty of Rome. By the time I address the Committee later, I shall have found out precisely what that cryptic message means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was stressing is the main point on which I seek the support of the Committee. We do not stand by every detail of the texts produced by the Commission. Refinements are necessary before they form the basis of legislation. However, the Commission is seeking to liberalise trade in pharmaceutical products and to ensure that there are proper and effective licensing procedures for the European Community countries. We share those objectives and we wish to see them turned into effective action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fair to say that there is a broad consensus on the need for change. I serve on the Select Committee on Health, which has embarked on an inquiry into the implications for health in the United Kingdom of European legislation and the various movements in Europe. One area that we have looked at in some detail is the licensing procedures for drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee visited Brussels last year—we shall be there again next week—to consider this issue and others that are of major importance. I welcome the assurances that the Minister has given on some of the points made. I gained the impression that drug regulation in the European Community is in great difficulty. That was clear from the dialogue that the Select Committee held last year and from the evidence that it has taken from colleagues from the Department of Health, including the Minister's colleague in the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason for the present problems seems to be the way in which individual member states, in the run-up to 1993, are attempting to preserve their own decision making processes for fairly obvious reasons. It is interesting that the Commission has stated that the present multi-state approach to drug regulation is in disrepute and has caused major problems to the drugs industry and to member countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the 10 per cent. of applications currently being considered under the multi-state system, none has been accepted without question by the other countries. That says something about the present difficulties. There is common consent that the present system needs to be changed urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the debate on this issue has centred on the choice between a centralised or a decentralised system. The proposals that the Minister outlined are a compromise and incorporate both systems. That might make sense if it produces an agreement in the EC that might not otherwise be achieved. But there are questions, some of which I have raised already, about whether that system is simple enough to be fully understood and whether it will be workable in practice. Will there be duplication and additional bureaucracy? My concern—which has not been referred to in great detail so far—is whether the system will be publicly accountable. What influence will the public have? Will the system inspire public confidence in the drugs industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ticked off my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), who referred to the difficulties that have arisen. The public are genuinely concerned about some of the drugs on the market. People are right to ask whether the system will ensure that some of the problems that we have had up till now, which have had a devastating effect on some individuals, will be overcome by the new arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the decentralised system incorporated in the proposals implies some form of confidence in the individual systems of individual countries. When I made that comment, I was not implying that our system is best. Are we sufficiently confident that our system ensures that the public is protected against particular problems? Are we confident that we have got the system right?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last November, press reports were published by a newspaper that is normally totally loyal to the Minister's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
party, the 
	<i>Sunday Express,</i> which exposed significant corruption in drug trials in this country. The 
	<i>Sunday Express</i> of 3 November claimed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The General Medical Council has details of at least 20 cases of fraud involving 14 doctors—with more in the pipeline."</p></blockquote>
The fraud related to doctors undertaking trials on behalf of drug companies and falsifying results in return for payment from the companies. For example, the article said that the cases include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A doctor who returned a completed test form to the pharmaceutical firm before he had even been sent the drugs.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A GP who diagnosed peptic ulcers at 10 times the national rate.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Doctors who returned forms with unused medicines, or tubes squeezed in the same way.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>GPs claiming cash when the drug available was not in their area."</p></blockquote>
A huge range of anxiety was exposed. An inquiry was set up following those revelations and perhaps the Minister will comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be conscious of what is happening in this country when evaluating the performance of other countries. If there are such problems in this country, where we believe there is a reasonably refined system, are there similar or worse problems in other member countries? Will those problems be incorporated into the local licensing arrangements under the proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Select Committee took evidence, the deputy chief medical officer made it clear that whatever system is introduced—unified, decentralised or both—the process involved should be consistent. Common multi-state assessment standards are crucial. I would welcome the Minister's assurance that he is happy that such standards will be adopted under the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that relates to public anxiety about expos—s, such as that in the 
	<i>Sunday Express,</i> is that the public should be satisfied that procedures are thorough and consistent. There is increasing anxiety in this country—not so much on the continent—about which procedures are used to test drugs, especially if they use animals. Many people want to be assured that animals have not been subjected to unnecessary cruelty in order to test drugs before they come on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would appreciate the Minister's comments on whether the proposals ensure that summaries will be published on why a drug has been recommended for licensing. The public should know the details of testing procedures so that they can be confident that those procedures were appropriate to ensure the safety of the drugs prescribed to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of change that we are debating should overcome the current mistrust that there is in member states. I mentioned that 10 per cent. of drugs use the present multi-state approval system. From 1986 to 1990, Italy rejected 96 per cent. of its multi-state applications; the Netherlands rejected 92 per cent. and Belgium 83 per cent. Clearly, significant problems have to be overcome to establish a common, generally accepted, system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether—perhaps the Minister can give us an assurance—there has been any consideration of the initial formation of regional groupings rather than a move to a system throughout the EC, perhaps involving the United Kingdom and Ireland or the Benelux countries, as a starting point before we move fully to arrangements involving the whole membership of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also welcome further comment by the Minister on financing the new system. I said that there is serious
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
concern about the way in which the United Kingdom system is based on fees from drug companies. The implication is not necessarily that he who pays the piper calls the tune, but perhaps our system is not completely independent when its existence depends on funding from the companies for which it licences drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also concern that there is a commercial relationship between the drug regulatory bodies and drug marketing in the United Kingdom and that is questionable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the hon. Gentleman's points are quite interesting but his last seems pretty weak. I thought that the Government set a fee which recovers the cost for the agency. That is similar to the system that has worked for motor cars and various other items that require approval. To suggest that there could be commercial pressure from an applicant who has to pay a fee set by an authority seems unlikely—indeed, impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question has been raised with me. I have met people who have offered those criticisms and I have talked to people from the drug companies. In principle, the system raises questions on whether the existence of the agency is dependent on fees from the people whom it licences. I am not suggesting corruption, but saying that it might be possible to consider alternatives in a new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not entirely reassured by the Minister's response to my specific question on how the new arrangements will be financed. Clearly, that has a bearing on the way in which the system operates in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for us to discuss the implications for companies involved with member countries when things go wrong. We need to talk about licensing and about the system of drug withdrawal. I am concerned that drug withdrawals have been neglected as an aspect of drug regulations and I ask the Minister to tell us whether there will be clear, rapid procedures to withdraw drugs from the market regardless of whether they come through the local system or the new Europeanwide agency. We need to ensure a rapid response to problems and that withdrawal in one country is matched by withdrawal in others. When a drug causes problems, common consent to deal with them must be obtained urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) asked a valid question on how we could ensure that new drugs would not cause problems if taken alongside existing drugs. I hope that the Minister will deal with that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also appreciate the Minister's comments on the arrangements that the new system will provide when companies become liable for compensation for damage caused to people's health by licensed drugs. That is not made clear in the information provided to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude on a positive note of support, the Labour party has been concerned for many years about the manner in which the drug industry in this country and elsewhere markets its products. I have been a witness to lavish entertainment given to GPs and hospital doctors. [HON. MEMBERS: "What?"] I said that I was a witness to it—I was in the hotel where it took place but was not a party to it. There is serious concern about the inducements that have been offered in the past, including free holidays in the form of meetings in exotic places which have been trips rather than conferences. Therefore, the Opposition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
wholeheartedly support the changes that are proposed and welcome the moves to outlaw such practices throughout Europe.

I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply to the points that I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions. Is he satisfied with the safeguards and regulations envisaged for the importation of pharmaceutical products produced in third countries and marketed and sold in the European Community? Article 45, as amended by the European Parliament, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency, in consultation with the Member States and the Commission, shall set up a data-processing network for the rapid transmission of data between the competent Community authorities in the event of an alert relating to faulty manufacture, serious undesirable effects and other pharmacovigilance data regarding medicinal products".</p></blockquote>
I presume that, if it was felt in the United Kingdom that a particular product was, to use a colloquialism, producing dangerous side-effects in patients, the Department of Health could speedily and unilaterally remove that product from the pharmacists' shelves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister nodding, but I would like his assurance for the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) asked the same question, but my answer may have been a trifle confusing. Under the decentralised system responsibility for issuing the licence rests on the national authority—even if it results from the compulsory conciliation process decided in Brussels—and the national authority is responsible for withdrawing it if pharmacovigilance information comes to hand which requires that to happen. Responsibility for issuing the licence under the centralised procedure clearly rests with the Commission in Brussels and in normal circumstances responsibility for maintaining, answering for, and withdrawing it would also rest with the Commission. However, article 36 of the treaty of Rome includes a power that stands ahead of the normal position. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants".</p></blockquote>
That is a superior power which, in exceptional circumstances, and if pharmacovigilance information provides justification, allows us to act unilaterally at a national level to withdraw a licence issued by the centralised procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but I want to ask a supplementary question. With regard to the European economic area, could the seven countries of EFTA seek advice and guidance from the centralised body in Brussels? I presume that, during the protracted negotiations, this measure was brought to the attention of the negotiators representing the EFTA countries. We now have a much wider market of 19 countries—it was debated in the Chamber several days ago—and there would have to be compatibility between the Twelve and the seven
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
countries of EFTA. I take it that their methods and procedures are compatible with those envisaged in this document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 54 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Management Board shall consist of two representatives from each Member State and two representatives of the Commission."</p></blockquote>
It will also include two representatives appointed by the European Parliament, as I said earlier. Will the Minister confirm that the United Kingdom will be represented by officials from the Department of Health and from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the motion, which refers to the need for detailed improvements to be made to the text, primarily to ensure that the health and safety of the United Kingdom's human and animal populations are fully protected. At the end of the day, the House of Commons must concern itself with the protection of the individual consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection, I wish to ask another question of the Minister. I refer to the second paragraph on page xi of the 26th report of the Scrutiny Committee. It was discussing the concerns of the Department of Health about the proposal and the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department notes that the proposal seems to imply that the Commission (or, in exceptional circumstances, the Council), as the body which adopts each decision into"—</p></blockquote>

	<i>[Interruption.]</i> These modern gadgets that Welsh Members use are noisy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Commission (or, in exceptional circumstances, the Council), as the body which adopts each decision into Community law would bear full scientific, legal and political responsibility."</p></blockquote>
I would add moral responsibility. The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nevertheless it would seem sensible to clarify this for the avoidance of doubt in the event, for example, of litigation by an individual claiming damages."</p></blockquote>
I listened intently to what the Minister said about Zantac. I am prompted by his story of a doctor prescribing medicinal products to a patient to say that the relationship that exists between a doctor and his patient—if the patient is not a medical person himself—puts the patient in a uniquely vulnerable position. I accept what the Minister said—that the doctor's objective and his raison d'être is to restore his patient to full health—but in doing so, the doctor has to prescribe medicinal products. The patient cannot assess the efficacy of those products. He or she has to take what the doctor says on trust. Patients have immense trust in their doctors' competence, knowledge and skill. Occasionally, things go badly awry. We remember Thalidomide victims and many others, but not all are at that tragic level; some individuals suffer appalling side-effects from drugs which are discovered only when that person is taking the prescribed drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the patient is in a uniquely vulnerable position. It is essential that doctors prescribe sensibly, intelligently and well. However, if patients are vulnerable, so, too, are general practitioners. They have to take largely on trust what they are told by those selling the products. Sadly, but inevitably, cases will arise where people will legitimately seek financial compensation for the harmful effects of prescribed drugs taken on trust. Presumably a person who has suffered damage as a result of taking harmful substances will still be able to take action in the English or Scottish courts, but, if the proposal were adopted, who will bear the legal responsibility? I fully
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
agree with the Department; the matter is serious if products are to be authenticated or guaranteed by the European agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other serious difficulty that the Minister and his officials face is that the procedure will not have a second stage in respect of the appeals system. The absence of a second and independent forum is common throughout the rest of the European Community, whereas the position in the United Kingdom is different. Will there be a levelling-down process? Surely if we, as parliamentarians, are concerned about the protection of the people of the nation, it is essential that we level up, if the Committee will forgive the crudity of that phrase, rather than level down to the sort of appeals procedure that is common throughout the other 11 member states. The Minister should be arguing for the establishment of a second and independent forum for considering scientific disagreements. I hope that my questions have demonstrated my serious concern about the measure. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that we could continue to develop, enhance, strengthen and sharpen up a system of mutual recognition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.2 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the work that has been done by this country, together with other countries in the European Community, to develop a means of providing basic assurances to those who prescribe and to those who take pharmaceutical products. As the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) said, it is important to build on the way in which the United Kingdom system has developed. It is also self-evident that there needs to be a central system under which people who operate within the European Community can obtain approval for pharmaceutical products. There must be a framework whereby it is known that permission has been given for a product and that it has not been disapproved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that no responsibility is placed on the approving authorities to guarantee that a product is safe efficacious or of high quality. It is up to the producers to give such assurances within the protocol that is laid down. They must undertake the tests in such a way as to meet the protocol and must carry out certain procedures and follow them through honestly. That point was made in the 
	<i>Sunday Express</i> article, which showed that the General Medical Council was dealing with people who were unethical and who had done things that they should not have done under the protocols required both for doctors and for the testing of drugs. It is important to have a system that can pick up those who do wrong or that can test whether those who are accused of doing wrong are guilty of such an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not be the agency—whether at European or national level—that pays the compensation, unless it has done something so stupid that it has fallen well below the required standard of administration. Those who invent, develop or produce products must be responsible for them. One reason why the United Kingdom has the least bad health and safety at work record in the European Community is because of the tripartite nature of the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, which ensures that no changes can be made that would reduce the level of safety implicit in the regulations. We should bring together the experience of those in Government, the work force and employers to
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
produce practical regulations that give the best possible assurance that unnecessary and undesirable risk will be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who work in the pharmaceutical area are trying to deal with conditions that people and their animals—farm animals as well as domestic pets—find unutterably painful, damaging and disabling. I am not saying that we shall find the answer to every problem under the sun—whether they require cosmetic treatments or are genuine medical conditions—but the work of those who design and adapt products to improve the well-being of human beings and animals is as important as the work of those who flog through medical school and then hang up a nameplate and work as a GP or in a hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was Minister responsible for agriculture in Northern Ireland, I dealt with scientists at the faculty at Queen's university, those working for the Ministry of Agriculture and those in private laboratories. Those people are dedicated to achieving the safest possible system, but as scientists they realise that it is impossible to know in advance what the side-effects of certain drugs will be. We are aware that people are willing to accept risks, for example, in surgical procedures. There may be a one in four chance of dying from an operation and a 50 per cent. chance of having one's life improved by it. That is at the extreme; there are few such examples. The surgical operation on a malformed pancreas has that sort of risk. Other procedures may have a more slender risk, such as the risk of dying while under anaesthetic. Quantifiable risks are taken all the time. The person who dies under an anaesthetic does not have a legitimate claim for compensation because that is a known risk of which people should be warned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central point is that if information about the system is made available, that is the best guarantee of ensuring that necessary adaptions of the procedure are made. The Committee on Safety of Medicines came about because people began to learn from previous mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall switch thoughts for a moment. Any pharmaceutical company—whether it develops products for animals or human beings—that is serious about its business wants to ensure that everyone not only follows the procedures to the letter but tries to discover the disadvantages and advantages of a drug and the procedures used. They must decide whether the balance would be acceptable, even if the product managed to get approval. It is important that relevant information on side-effects or adverse reactions is made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent BBC radio programme dealt with the succession of pharmaceutical products available to treat depression. Cocaine, morphine, barbiturates and heaven knows what else, which seemed not to have side-effects, to be habit forming or to create dependency, turned out to have such consequences. If we react faster to the available information, we will be able to tell patients, doctors and veterinarians about the downsides of using a drug to treat problems of the mind, the body or both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth continuing to make detailed points in the European Community and analysing rigorously, by logic and in practice, the way in which systems are likely to work. As a supporter of the development of the European Community, I believe that there are people in the Commission who understand that, if the different national traditions can be drawn together, it will be possible to find a system that is likely to work. As Opposition Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
have said, it must work in a way that does not increase the risk that people will be sloppy or devious in dealing with the procedures laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drug manufacturers should still have the opportunity to approach their national authority—that is the English term for the European expression "decentralised agency". Some manufacturers are not large-scale companies and are not aiming at Europe-wide distribution at any stage, let alone at the beginning. By building on the best that is in the United Kingdom and in many of the European countries, we will develop a system that people can trust. We will be able to trust it only if the information becomes available to people in the field and if it is made available on inquiry to those outside the field who want to test whether matters are being dealt with satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for speaking at length; I must leave soon for another parliamentary engagement. I hope that one of the side effects of a centralised agency will be less need for repetition of experiments on animals. Such experiments may be necessary for the development of the product, but need not be repeated six, eight or 10 times. I am not against experimentation on animals where that is necessary. For products designed to increase the welfare of animals and to reduce the effect of animal diseases, it is difficult to think how they could be tested if not on animals. Sometimes it is necessary to run tests and repeat them on animals for products designed to improve the well-being of human beings. I regard that as acceptable if it can be demonstrated that there is no other way of doing it. I hope that the overall effect will be that fewer animals will be exposed to procedures and that those exposed to painful procedures, which is only a minority, will be reduced even faster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the disturbance caused by my newfangled gadget, as the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) called it. Because of it, I may have to leave before the winding-up speeches, but I shall, of course, read them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to a point that emerged in earlier exchanges. It begs a central question affecting not only the matter that we are discussing today, but the working of the European Community. I refer to the balance between the federal and the confederal nature of the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some countries may have tighter controls in their national structures and may have been more unwilling to grant licences to products. That seems almost inevitable, as there are 12 countries with different standards and backgrounds. We have had experience of specific drugs—the example of Halcion was mentioned earlier. In those circumstances the European norm will either hit at an average of the Twelve or it will move towards the highest common factor or the lowest common denominator among them. The commercial pressure will obviously be to try to get a drug marketed as widely as possible. From a safety angle, the pressure may be towards the highest common factor—the tightest regime under individual national scrutiny and control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will inevitably come a time when a member state considers that a drug should be withdrawn. The licence may have been issued centrally in Europe but, for various reasons, an individual country may not want the drug to
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
be available in that country. The Minister referred to article 36 of the treaty of Rome and said that in exceptional circumstances it may be used. The question that arises is, what are exceptional circumstances? I ask the question rhetorically. I do not expect the Minister to be able to give an interpretation as we are mapping new ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different countries will have had different experiences of diseases. Some diseases are more prevalent in some countries. Industrial conditions—for example, pneumoconiosis—are more prevalent in some countries. Some conditions are specific to industries that may exist only in one or two countries. Those countries may want a drug to be banned, whereas countries that do not have such wide experience of that industry may not. That is one of the issues with which we shall have to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is that of a national interpretation of morality, to which the Minister has referred, in quoting from the treaty of Rome. An example is the effect of a drug on a child in the womb. Some member states may regard that child as sacred—one has only to think of what is happening in Ireland at the moment in that regard—and may want to ban a drug because of the ethical implications, although there may not be a central Community acceptance of such feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is a clash between the right of a constituent member state and policy decisions taken on a central, European level. There are interests on both sides and a balance will have to be struck. Clearly, the Government have come to a conclusion on that in recommending this substantial package. The Committee and the House have a right to know the Government's views on the extent to which central decision-making should be allowed to overrule local interests, the balance that should be made, and whether subsidiarity should apply to the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two vital principles are involved—the safety of drugs and the health and future of the pharmaceutical industry. As my hon. Friend the Minister eloquently reminded us, Britain has an interest in the matter, not only as consumer but very much as producer. Such British involvement is unfortunately not always pointed out in other Committee debates on industrial products. The Minister regretted that not enough had been said about the successes of the British pharmaceutical industry. I shall be even more fulsome in my praise of them than he was. He mentioned a Glaxo product that had been highly effective in treating his ulcer. Glaxo is generally regarded, with Merk in America, as the most successful research-based drug company in the world. The other four major British producers—ICI, SmithKline Beecham, Fisons and Wellcome also have an extremely good record of innovation and currently have some very interesting research projects in the pipeline. Within the European Community, only Germany has a pharmaceutical industry of equivalent range and depth. Besides France, which has one or two good ethical companies, the other nine member states have no great interest in the matter as producers—although if Sweden and Switzerland were to join, the Community would have two more countries with substantial pharmaceutical industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debate, we should bear in mind—as I know the Minister will—the fact that accountability is vital because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
we have a significant national interest to defend. That is why I formulated my questions to the Minister from the perspective of industrial interest. That interest is to have registration procedures that are as efficient as possible, that cost as little as possible—and, goodness knows, the cost merely of preparing an application is enormously high, as figures in the documentation demonstrate—and, most importantly, take as little time as possible. Everyone knows that the less time the procedure takes, the sooner the drug can be marketed and the drug company can generate some cash flow. In evaluating a drug's prospects, as a drug company must before deciding to launch into research and development on it, the company will be very influenced by the cost, and, most importantly, the speed of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thoroughly endorse everything that the Minister said on that subject. I too take a catholic view of that compromise. On the whole, the Government's position is on the right lines. I welcome the Minister's point that it would be tactless and probably administratively cumbersome to try and move overnight from one system to another. It might be called a market mechanism to determine the rate of progress from the present de-centralised, nationally-based system to the compromise system and, perhaps, to a more centralised system. The drug companies themselves, in registering major new compounds, will decide whether to apply to the national agencies or to the new Community agency. For reasons that I have already mentioned, with which I believe the Minister agrees, they will generally go to the new Community agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now covered the essentials of the Government's resolution and I shall be happy to vote for it in a few moments. Beyond that, however, my judgment differs slightly from the Government's in that we might have got things the wrong way round. The agency does not appear to have the right to decide upon secondary registration, but it has responsibility for pharmacovigilance. To avoid doubt, I shall quote one sentence from article 48 of the proposed direction, at the bottom of page 21, where it states that the agency shall undertake the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the continuing supervision, under practical conditions of use, of medicinal products which have been authorized within the Community".</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that pharmacovigilance had not yet been negotiated, but the meaning of that sentence is clear—the agency will have the responsibility for pharmacovigilance for any products that have been authorised within the Community. It does not say that it is authorised within the Community through the centralised procedure. Unless my understanding of the English language is deficient that must surely mean whether authorised by the de-centralised or the centralised procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency has competence in the registration of major new compounds, but the agency has the responsibility for pharmacovigilance across the board, whether orginally registered by it or by the national agency. The agency does not have competence in secondary registration. We might have got that the wrong way round. I entirely accept the Minister's argument that it does not make sense for pharmacovigilance to be entrusted to a single centralised agency located somewhere in Europe. Of its very essence, that function is surely best de-centralised and delegated to national agencies, which are in close contact with their own medical profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
On the other hand, there are strong economic arguments for allowing the pharmaceutical industry at least to have the option to go for secondary registration. It is important that secondary registration is as rapid and efficient as possible. Companies should know that once their applications are registered they can market Community-wide, which is what single market is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government consider those two functions—again—secondary registration and pharmacovigilance—to see whether they might be reversed? I am prepared to accept that I may have completely misunderstood some essential point and that my argument was based on a false premise. However, on the facts that have emerged from today's debate, I feel that we should consider those points again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we are discussing the establishment of a new agency. Depending on the range of responsibilities and functions that we accord to it, it will be a larger or a smaller organisation. However, given the business that will go to it as a result of the proposal—even based on a minimal presumption—it will be an important agency. As the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) said, it will employ many pharmacologists, microbiologists, medical doctors and goodness knows how many administrative staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency is one of those plums that come up from time to time as we proceed towards European integration. Where will it be located? We have not heard about that. I am not necessarily insisting that it must be our aim to ensure that it is in this country. To balance the national interest, I would prefer that the European central bank was here, but at least we can use the agency as a bargaining counter. For example, the Germans would love to have the European central bank. They have a large phamaceutical industry, so perhaps they would be interested in the agency, too. There is tremendous potential for a major horse trade to be carried out. I should like to have an assurance that the Government have thought through the matter and that they are well prepared for such a negotiation. We must be clear about our priorities and how we shall play our card.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not be sensible for the Minister to respond now to some of my detailed points as a difficult negotiation process is in prospect. That the agency will be of considerable interest to this country must be registered in the minds of the Government and of the Committee, whether we shall bid for it to be located here or regard it as a major bargaining card for the purpose of acquiring some other European institution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The central lesson that we have learnt from our experience of drugs over the past 40 years must not be ignored. We must question our view of drugs and their role in society. Drugs have produced enormous advantages. I shall not dwell on those advantages, not because I do not consider them to be important, but because there are enough members of the Committee who are consultants in the industry and who can give eloquent voice to that side of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious downside to the industry must not be ignored. It involves not just those people whose lives have been destroyed by drugs, but the millions of people who are dependent on drugs. We have talked a great deal about illegal drugs, but far more people are dependent on drugs that have been prescribed for medicinal purposes than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
have lost their lives as a result of illegal drugs. A vast number of suicide and parasuicide cases have occurred because of the easy availability of deadly drugs which, if taken in small quantities, are harmless and benign but which, if taken in large quantities, are deadly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, often the drugs that are prescribed for anguish and anxiety or depression eventually kill people if they are taken in large quantities. Dozens of types of drugs that are familiar household names, such as paracetamol, are advertised as safe, yet when people take handfuls of such drugs in moments of despair, it could mean the end of their lives. The labelling on bottles is hopelessly inadequate and the dangers of certain drugs are not properly described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Conservative Members have given their views on the business side of the industry. Opposition Members take a different line. It is not true that the drugs industry is not profit motivated. Let us consider what has happened in the industry. It has concentrated its research and development on those drugs that can make profits—those taken for headaches, stomach aches, period pains and depression, which have mass markets. There has been continuous neglect of those drugs that prove useful in clearing up the diseases, some quite deadly, that affect small numbers of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry has been profit-orientated, but lessons have been learnt in the past few years because of questions that were raised. I suggest that the dreadful consequences of Thalidomide were the result of good science, but that the consequences of Halcion are the result of bad science. That is the most worrying trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had been speaking 10 years ago, I would have defended the integrity of science and scientific procedures. Exhaustive trials on Thalidomide were carried out and the drug was even tried on pregnant rabbits without producing the birth defects that occurred when it was used by human beings. Only after the drug was tested on a special strain of rabbit was that result reproduced. The lesson was clear: no matter how many trials are carried out on how many animals, results will not be known until the real experiment is carried out on the human population. We must admit that the trials of new drugs that are carried out are always imperfect and inadequate. The only trial that matters occurs after a new drug comes on the market and is taken by human beings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not pick up the point that I made in an intervention. Of course, we want scientific information to be available, not only in the community but universally. We want alarm bells to ring loudly round the globe, but we should like the development and progress of new drugs to be as sluggish as possible. That is the lesson of the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Halcion caused dreadful experiences and shattered our faith in the whole scientific profession. A reputable international company deliberately falsified scientific information about the product and when that became known it lied about it and attempted to conceal the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar claims have been made about the use of silicon implants. That raises questions about bad or fraudulent science and people disguising the results of experiments. That is very alarming. It is also alarming to know, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) said, how strong the profit motive is in the drug industry and how it uses inducements. Some inducements are
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
relatively harmless such as providing people with meals; one drug company sent every doctor in the country a free stethoscope some years ago. Such soft corruption of the medical profession by the drug companies is carried out in the interests of profit. We must consider that downside aspect of the drug industry before we make any decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience is divided in the House. That of Conservative Members largely results, quite legitimately, from their interest in the industry. They talk of balance sheets and markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have not misunderstood that last comment of the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that Opposition Members are equally concerned for the interests of British industry, but I do not believe that Conservative Members are motivated by any personal interest. Certainly, I have no personal interest in the pharmaceutical industry and I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House share a commitment to support a successful British industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon. Gentleman waited, he would have heard my next sentence: the Opposition strongly express their legitimate interest in jobs in the industry. They may not be present, but some Opposition Members have an interest in the drug industry as representatives of a large number of its workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience of the drug industry is of its other side. I worked for 30 years as a chemist carrying out trials of that nature, not in that industry but in another. My experience as a Member of Parliament has been of the victims who hae been addicted to apparently harmless drugs and the families of those who have taken their lives or suffered by taking them. The great engine that drives the industry is the profit motive. The industry has produced many advantages and benefits, but we would be foolish to ignore the cases of Halcion and Thalidomide and the other great tragedies of the drug industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.35 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A wide range of issues has been raised and I shall try to respond to as many of them as possible. The theme running through the speeches of both Conservative and Opposition Members was to ensure that the pharmacovigilance system envisaged in the proposals is effective and firmly rooted in local communities. Hon. Members were anxious to ensure that information passes quickly and accurately to those responsible for making decisions from the information available, and that cross-references can be made within the pharmacovigilance system to allow linkages that may not be immediately obvious to be made between different pieces of information. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) made much of that issue. Both sides of the Committee believe that effective drug licensing and regulation depends upon effective, efficient pharmacovigilance, and are committed to ensuring that whatever system emerges from the evolutionary process envisaged by the Commission recognises that obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) asked specifically about the role of the agency in the management and monitoring of pharmacovigilance, especially with regard to licences issued by national licensing agencies and therefore not directly the responsibility of the licensing authority based
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
in Brussels. I hope that I can answer my hon. Friend directly by saying that we need to resolve the details of precisely how pharmacovigilance will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opening comments I said that it was a British concern to ensure that we understood precisely where obligations rested and that the pharmacovigilance system was properly rooted in local communications systems. First, the issue needs to be clarified in further negotiations. Secondly, we believe that the responsibility for managing the day-to-day operation of pharmacovigilance should rest on the national licensing agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The passage from the proposed legislation quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding dealt with the monitoring of what remain identifiable national agencies. The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) rightly stressed that information drawn from those national agencies should be made freely available through the European network. That is the proper role of the agency. The day-to-day management of the obligation to collect accurate information from the system rests on the national agency. There is no desire on our part—nor, we believe, on the part of the Commission—to seek to establish a parallel European pharmacovigilance system, much less a centrally run system managed from Brussels. I cannot see a benefit in that, but I can see that it might have serious disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) and for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) drew attention to the fact that at present national systems tend to produce different conclusions from the same evidence. We need to ensure that we do not move to the lowest common denominator, and that we can all feel comfortable with the standards that we end up enforcing as a result of the new system. That does not necessarily mean that we should go to the other extreme and accept the highest standard imposed if it cannot be justified on a proper scientific basis. It is possible to over-engineer these issues as well as skimp and save and provide an inadequate scientific basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that the decision-making authority in Brussels rests its decisions on scientific conclusions with which we can feel comfortable. We should not compromise that in negotiation. When negotiations end, we must ask ourselves whether we would be comfortable with the scientific results that are likely to emerge from the proposed system. If the answer is no, we shall not support the final proposal form. We shall try to avoid that position: it does not lend itself properly to compromise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that the negotiations about adopting the proposals will continue for several years yet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that they will not. I said at the outset that I am not convinced that it will be possible for us to arrive at a common position even under the United Kingdom presidency in the second half of 1992. However, we shall seek to make progress and if it is possible to reach a common position later this year, we shall do so, because we think that serious benefits would be achieved by progressing with the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dissent totally with the view of the hon. Member for Newport, West that our objective should be to establish a licensing system that progressed applications as sluggishly as possible. The hon. Gentleman may wish to reflect on those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I underline my point about Thalidomide? The experiment with new drugs takes place on the human population and the smaller the population the better. Thalidomide was marketed throughout Europe almost simultaneously. If it had been marketed in one country, the cases resulting from it would have been confined to one country. The introduction of new drugs should be as sluggish as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I could argue about this all morning. I do not accept that when a drug is marketed, it is given a clear market licence and is then subject to a trial on the human population. What is clearly true is that the use of pharmaceutical products, as with the rest of medicine, is not risk-free. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham mentioned the use of anaesthetics which have been with us for several generations. That use is not risk-free. Medicine in all its forms is not free of risk. The important thing is that the decision-making process should be scientifically founded and, on the basis of scientific evidence, should reach informed conclusions about the balance of benefit and risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman sought to diminish the scientific process by quoting examples of fraudulent science. I do not endorse fraudulent science any more than I endorse fraudulent politics, bankers or anyone else. I do not endorse any fraudulent activity. But where it is carried on in good faith, a process of licensing medicinal products based on sound science seems to me to bring clear, tangible benefits to science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) asked about third-country imports to the Community. They are governed by the same licensing system as products produced in the Community. It matters not where the product is produced; we are talking of a control on marketing. He asked about the links between the agency and the equivalent institutions in EFTA countries. I am told that such links are already established, but I shall write to the Committee about the implications of the proposals for the new European economic area and I shall include in that letter a comment on the point that the hon. Gentleman raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked where the legal responsibility would lie for decisions that will be taken under the different licensing systems in the proposals. I sought to answer that earlier. There should be no doubt about who takes responsibility for those decisions. We believe that when the Brussels authority issues a licence under the centralised procedure, responsibility should rest with that authority. When a licence is issued by a national licensing agency—whether that results from its initial national decision, from conciliation through the decentralised procedure or from a decision in Brussels requiring compulsory conciliation through the decentralised procedure—responsibility should rest with the national agency, not with the Brussels authority. That is our present view, but the matter should be resolved during the negotiations. As I told someone yesterday, I believe that diffused responsibility is no responsibility at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the appeals system, I stressed earlier the value of having access to a second set of scientific experts when an applicant and the usual set of experts are unable to agree on the scientific conclusions that follow from the available evidence. We shall continue to argue that case. However, an open procedure is supposed to be involved and I pointed out that no other member state is currently
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
arguing that case. I hope that we shall persuade all 11 member states to recognise the wisdom of our case, whose benefits we can show in theory and from our experience of that system's operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham asked where liability would lie when an aggrieved patient took action for damages arising from the use of a licensed drug. As my hon. Friend rightly put it, the Government's view is that even if a licence has been granted, legal liability for the consequences of the use of the drug rests with the company that marketed it. However, I believe that that matter is currently in dispute, in court. We shall continue to argue our view that the present licensing control system should continue to operate and that product liability should remain with the marketing company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose that a constituent of mine suffered severe effects from a drug that was prescribed to him or her by a general practitioner and that drug were manufactured in France or Italy by a company that had no satellite subsidiaries in Scotland or England. Would my constituent be able to sue that company in a court of law in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's constituent can sue whom he likes. However, the question is where a court decides that liability rests. Our view is that liability clearly rests with the producing company under the law of the country in which the product is sold. However, that matter is in dispute in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarfon asked about the balance between the centralised system and the decentralised system and whether I could set that out in a single sentence which would be decisive in all circumstances. The answer is that I cannot, because the process is avowedly intended to be more subtle. As I said in answer to an earlier question by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, it is beneficial that the proposals seek a balance between centralised procedure in some cases and decentralised procedure in others. Moreover, that balance will evolve as we gain experience of operating the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
It does not matter too much how the balance resolves itself precisely, provided that how the system works is clear and that responsibility and accountability for the decision are clear. That is the fundamental issue. The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow, who raised the matter, was on to the key issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding also asked about the entitlement of a company to apply for central determination under the optional element of the procedure. I refer him to pages 112 and 113 of the Commission's explanatory memorandum, which set out clearly as an annex in part A those applications that would be required to be considered by the centralised procedure; with part B dealing with applications that may be so considered if the applicant company wishes. In not reading out virtually a whole page of text on entitlement to the optional procedure, I may have been guilty of oversimplifying. My hon. Friend may wish to study the text further. If he wishes to pursue the subject in more detail, I shall be pleased to assist him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding asked about the location of the new agency. There is no formal bid currently in process to have the agency located in Britain. However, we are very much alive to the game of chess where the pieces are not kings, queens, knights and pawns but various institutions of the European Community. We shall seek to ensure that we move all the pieces on the chessboard to our maximum national advantage. I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
