	<div class='legislation'>ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS (AMENDMENT OF ENACTMENTS RELATING TO STRENGTH AND TO UNITS OF MEASUREMENT) ORDER 1979</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Alcoholic Liquors (Amendment of Enactments Relating to Strength and to Units of Measurement) Order 1979 (S.I. No. 241).— [Mr. Robert Sheldon.]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Cope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not, of course, as controversial a motion as is likely to be dealt with on the Floor of the House today—indeed, it is not at all controversial between the parties—but I hope that the Financial Secretary will deal with one or two points before we dispose of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order very slightly changes some of the rates of duly. I take it that, in accordance with the 1977 Finance Act, it changes them no more than very slightly, but I should like the Financial Secretary to tell us what the changes are, either in percentage terms or however is most convenient, and whether he thinks that there will be an increase or decrease in the yield of tax as a result of these changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole middle section of the order deals deals with penalties and so on, and amends the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979. As I read it, all it does is to alter the way in which the offences lead to the penalties and the way in which the penal ties are described rather than to increase or decrease the penalties. However. I should like confirmation of that. The wording is not clear to a layman such as myself, but I am sure that it is clear to you, Mr. Blenkinsop, who have probably studied it with more care and attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that it is not very satisfactory that the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979—on which the ink is hardly dry—should be on the statute book and almost immediately we have this fairly long statutory instrument which
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
promptly amends it. I have no doubt that the Financial Secretary will explain the reasons—which I think I understand —why that has come about, but I repeat that it is unsatisfactory that we should finish up with a brand new Act of Parliament and then a string of amendments in a statutory instrument altering the whole thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are constant demands in the House for consolidation of the law in connection with tax and other matters, for the convenience of those who have to use it, and this is a case where that might usefully be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that, in fact, it has just been done, but to go to the trouble of consolidation and then immediately upset it again does not indicate to me that matters have been managed entirely for the benefit of those who have to try to use the legislation. It is extremely confusing for people constantly to search to see whether there are statutory instruments that amend and modify even brand new Acts of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.39 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope) said, there is to be a change in the rates. The order has to come before the House because it marginally increases the rates of duty, and I shall in a moment explain just how marginal the increase is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order has two purposes: first, the implementation of the directives under the Community legislation, and second, the replacement of the Sikes system of strength measurement for alcoholic drink by the OIML system, which is the international system. The OIML system measures it by relationship to the percentage of alcohol. The Sikes system was an old and well liked system, because of its anomalies and peculiarities, but it did not take account of a number of matters, not least that the volume changes with temperature, and it is easier to make use of a system that allows for this because of the practical problems of assessing the alcohol content of any particular liquor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also changes the units of measurements from imperial gallons to litres for Customs and Excise purposes. Of course, the measurements for retail sale remain unaffected and the pint can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
continue in the same way as it has for hundreds of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order provides a means of converting proof gallons into their metric counterpart—the litre of alcohol—during the transition period, which will assist those engaged in the industry. The Community directives prescribe that the new system should come into effect on 1 January 1980 at the latest, and it has been agreed with the trade associations that the changeover will take effect from that date and will coincide with the change to metric units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, the order requires the approval of the House because the metric rates for spirits and beer involve a slight rounding up to avoid cumbersome fractions. The resulting increase in the rates comes to 0·0066 per cent. This is so slight an increase that it is only a technicality that brings it to the House of Commons and before this Committee. While a rounding down would have resulted in a fair loss of revenue, the rounding up is minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other factor is that even without this rounding up we should still have had to come to the House of Commons because it is not possible to say that in no case would there ever be a greater charge to duty or a reduction in the relief or rebates because the systems are not strictly interchangeable. This order prepares for such a change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bid farewell to the Sikes system, which was the splendidly archaic method of placing one's proof spirit on gunpowder and igniting the spirit. If the spirit had too much water in it, it would dampen the gunpowder and nothing would happen, and if the spirit was over 100 degrees proof it would have exploded. But precisely at 100 degrees proof it just ignited—at least that was the "theory. We have not yet found a Customs and Excise officer—I have inquired into this—bold enough to conduct the experiment nowadays, although I believe that on a television programme some time ago it was done. I suspect that they had something in excess of 100 degrees proof to provide for the successful result of such an experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sikes system was glamorous, interesting, and perhaps amusing, but it is not really relevant to modern conditions when accuracy is rather more important than was the case in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The penalties remain the same. There is simply a conversion of the references in the existing penalty provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what the hon. Gentleman had to say about the change in the consolidated law. We should, of course, like legislation to be finalised at some stage and the consolidation to be effective for a considerable time. Unfortunately, things do not stand still in this area, and I am afraid that I cannot offer any assurance on that score. Obviously, the point that the hon. Gentleman makes is valid. We shall have to bear it in mind and make use of the opportunity when it arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Financial Secretary think that it was wise to introduce the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 when, presumably, the Government knew at that time that they were about to introduce this order, which is required to come into effect before the end of the year in which the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act was passed and which was already provided for in a Finance Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that directives from the EEC are not the certain propositions that they might appear. There have been a number of postponements on other matters from time to time. To have denied ourselves the opportunity of consolidating would have run counter to the point that the hon. Gentleman made when he urged consolidation. If we waited until all these matters were resolved there never would be any consolidation. It is far better to make consolidation from time to time when the bulk of the issues are before us than wait for the perfection which in practice, I regret, one is never likely to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. B. Cant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spin this Committee out to undue length, but I cannot say that I have mastered the contents of the order and I am provoked by the mood in which I find my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He has made various literary and historical allusions. I do not know whether his mood has anything to do with the fact that this is a D-day of some form or other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one technical point which interested me. Am I right that the Financial Secretary stated that the volume of alcohol actually varies with temperature?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
This raises for me as a pub or club drinker one or two interesting points. I have noticed—I believe this to be a general complaint—that since the beginning of the "Save it" campaign the temperature in all public establishments has, surprisingly, risen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I to infer from what the Financial Secretary said—apparently, he did say this—that as the temperature rises in some mysterious way the percentage volume of alcohol in, say, whisky, increases? If that is so, or if the reverse is the case, what is the significance of that in respect of this order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, may I be absolutely provocative and ask whether the Government—whose life, I am sure, will be prolonged by the vote tonight—will move towards the consideration, whether by statutory instrument, EEC directive or any other device, of applying similar rules to the alcoholic content of beer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I do not want to prolong the Committee unduly, but a number of us who are beer drinkers rather than spirit drinkers feel very strongly—I know I am out of order, Mr. Blenkinsop, but I am putting this down as a marker for the next Labour Government—that the rubbish we drink in many of our pubs and clubs today, which goes under the name of either lager or beer, is in its present condition because we simply refuse to apply an alcoholic volume content to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the thrust of what my hon. Friend is saying is that we should be pressing for a Common Market directive to harmonise the temperatures in all Common Market pubs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend presses for the implementation of a Common Market directive, I wonder what sort of issue is at stake here. I shall need considerable time, perhaps while the vote is being taken tonight, to ponder the inner significance of what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter for the future. I do not know whether it should appear in the official, or unofficial, manifesto of the Labour Party, but I think that it should be borne in mind. On the technical question of the effect of temperature on the volume of alcohol in spirits, however, I should like to hear the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to put my hon. Friend's mind at rest by sending his memory back to the third or fourth form at school, when he may have examined Boyle's law and its consequentials. If he did, he will know that volume increases with temperature. I must say, however, that the kind of temperatures to which he refers need a finer instrument of measurement than the human palate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what my hon. Friend said, but the important thing about the new change is that it allows for these matters—of lesser importance, I imagine, to the ordinary drinker, but of greater importance to the revenue raiser—to be distinguished rather more finely than even my hon. Friend's constituents are able to accomplish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Financial Secretary should be rude about his hon. Friend's palate, which I had always understood to be rather fine in these matters. I did not see any reference to this in the copy of 
	<i>Labour Activist</i> which came my way the other day, but I note what the hon. Gentleman says about his manifesto and I shall report to my hon. Friends what he would like the next Government to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Value Added Tax (Aids for the Disabled) Order 1979 (S.I. No. 245).—[
	<i>Mr. Robert Sheldon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.47 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This also is in no way a controversial order. I am interested to hear from the Financial Secretary exactly how apparatus which is basically a tape recorder can be sufficiently distinguished as between apparatus suitable for the purposes in the order, "talking books" and so on, and conventional tape recorders, with which we are all familiar and which are in frequent use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
This is one of the very few areas in which there are special value added tax arrangements for charities. The relief is, of course, very limited. There are some who think—I speak personally here—that value added tax relief for charities should be further extended. There was a case in my constituency recently of a church which had its bells repaired and had to raise a considerable amount to pay VAT on that, although the church is clearly a charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulties involved, but may we take what is now before us as an earnest that the Government, in so far as they may be able in the future, would like to extend with further orders of this kind the relief of VAT for charities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order provides legal cover for the current practice. It is useful for this purpose in avoiding the doubts which have been expressed by a number of people concerned with charities, and particularly those for the blind. Under the purchase tax provisions, the magnetic tapes which were known in those days as "talking books" for the blind were relieved of purchase tax, together with certain specialised equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the introduction of value added tax, item 1 of group 4 was intended to cover the same ground, and zero rated the special tape recorders rather than tape players and play-back machines. The hon. Gentleman's supposition is correct. They can be so distinguished. Hence the need for this statutory instrument. In the meantime, of course, extra-statutory zero rating was provided, but, clearly, this had to be put on a proper footing. The order does that. One charity, as we know, supplies a machine which both records and plays back. The order is worded to maintain the zero rating of such a machine and at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
same time to provide legislative cover for what was done extra-statutorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about relief of value added tax for charities. The example that he mentioned—the church bells—is, of course, outside the scope of the order. I should point out that there are a number of problems in extending zero rating, not least the Community obligation that we have entered into under the sixth directive on harmonisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we were extraordinarily successful in maintaining essentially the same value added tax legislation as we had before harmonisation, as compared with most other countries where there had to be substantial changes. The ordinary person in this country may well be unaware that there has been harmonisation because we managed to fit in all our own requirements during the course of the negotiations. This does, however, limit us in terms of the scope for future changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that church bells would necessarily be a violation of that harmonisation, but there would be problems, of course concerning the operation of value added tax itself. But perhaps we may pursue that better in another debate rather than in this one which is more narrowly circumscribed. The Finance Bill is the obvious place, but there may be other opportunities as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief is, as I have said, for the use of blind or severely handicapped persons. We have clarified the situation in this statutory instrument, which will, I hope, have the approval of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
