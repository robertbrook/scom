	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first question, I am sure that members of the Committee would wish me to express our gratitude to Merthyr Tydfil county borough council for agreeing to host this first sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee in the valleys of south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should particularly like to thank the chief executive of the council and his staff, as well as the Welsh Office, for the thorough and efficient arrangements that they have made for today's sitting. Members will be aware that I propose to suspend the Committee informally for lunch at 1 o'clock for about 45 minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
I remind the Committee of the rules for the use of the Welsh Language. Members are free to move from one language to another as they choose, provided that those who propose to speak in Welsh give the Chairman notice in English of their intention to do so, at the latest when called to speak or to put a question; and that points of order are raised only in English. I know that colleagues will also bear in mind the normal courtesies when intervening in speeches. I shall keep my fingers crossed that there is no repeat of the problems that occurred, through no one's fault, in Carmarthen. Will members of the Committee please ensure that their headsets are tuned to channel 2? To avoid interference, please keep the headsets away from the microphones, which are operated automatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come now to questions to the Secretary of State for Wales. As the Standing Order allows only 30 minutes for this business, I appeal to right hon. and hon. Members for brief supplementary questions and brief replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>The Secretary of State for Wales was asked</i>—</p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>Trends in Employment</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>1. 
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on trends in employment in manufacturing in Wales during the past 12 months. [48379]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The number of employee jobs in manufacturing in Wales increased by 6,100–2.9 per cent.—between March 1997 and March 1998 to a total of 214,000–21.8 per cent. of all employee jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that answer. I also thank the officers of Merthyr Tydfil county borough council for the welcome that we received. It gives me great pleasure to be here as I spent my political apprenticeship in the former chamber of Merthyr Tydfil county borough council—and I still have the political bruises to show for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Under-Secretary satisfied that the trend in recent months from the end of the period that he quoted shows that the increase in manufacturing jobs is being maintained? I ask that question in view of the widespread redundancies in Wales, including those at the old Ferodo factory and the Dynamex factory in my constituency. Such job losses are associated with the overvalued pound, the great difficulty being experienced by manufacturers in exporting and the competition from having their prices undercut by imports. Given that Hoover employed about 5,000 people in this town when I lived here but now employs fewer than 1,000 is the Under-Secretary satisfied that the future for manufacturing jobs in Wales is secure? What is the policy of the Welsh Office on the value of the pound?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly satisfied that the future of manufacturing in Wales is secure. Our new economic agenda, which we shall be discussing later, addresses that point centrally. We are concerned about the high rate of the pound; there is no question about that. Furthermore, the pressure on manufacturing, and especially on its export component is severe, which is why we are closely monitoring the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been two continuous quarters of decline in manufacturing in this country, as a result of which it is now technically in recession. Given the recessions that are taking place in other countries—I am thinking particularly of the Asian economy and the introduction of regional development agencies throughout the rest of the United Kingdom—the competition for inward investment in Wales will be more severe than ever. Manufacturing plays a vital part in that inward investment. What new initiatives does the Under-Secretary plan to introduce to ensure that Wales continues to receive its fair share of inward investment, particularly in manufacturing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new economic agenda "Pathway to Prosperity" is packed full of new initiatives. It also describes how the new powerhouse, the revitalised
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Welsh Development Agency, will be given as one of its priorities support for increased opportunities for manufacturing. Manufacturing is crucial to the future of Wales; we have a larger proportion of manufacturing than any other part of Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Health Care (South Wales)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>2. 
	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What action he will take to improve standards of health care in the valleys of south Wales. [48380]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are committed to a crusade for excellence in every national health service provision at every NHS facility. That crusade will be pursued with vigour in Wales. I expect the development of local authority health groups, with health service and local government involvement, to focus on health care and health promotion for the communities that they serve. I shall continue to pursue initiatives to encourage the recruitment of doctors and dentists, together with other primary and community health action to encourage best practice and innovation. There will be further developments with the establishment of healthy living centres. Our "Better Health—Better Wales" Green Paper will be followed by an action plan for Wales and by specific demonstration projects in deprived areas, which are aimed at improving standards of health and health care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is genuine anxiety in Cynon valley about the composition of the health group. As my hon. Friend will know, there is already anxiety there about local authority arrangements. We are linked with Rhondda-Taff Ely, an arrangement that Cynon valley considers unsatisfactory, because it does not have a sufficiently strong voice of its own. It would be catastrophic if those arrangements were replicated for health groups. Will my hon. Friend either give Cynon Valley a voice of its own, independent of Rhondda-Taff Ely, or ensure that Cynon valley's voice can be heard loud and clear within the proposed arrangement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I can give my hon. Friend such an assurance. Although there will be a local health group for the local authority area of RhonddaCynon Taff, in the consultation that is currently taking place, we are considering how, within the larger local health groups, there can be informal groups of doctors and other health care professionals for smaller areas within the local health group area. In addition, doctors in Cynon valley will still have budgets and, therefore, a prime say within the local health group on how money should be used to commission health care in Cynon valley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having conducted some undercover research of my own on the health service, with the aid of a paraglider and a hard Welsh mountain, I congratulate the NHS on my recovery. Will the Under-Secretary assure us that consultation such as those to which he refers in south and mid Wales are genuine? If the case put by local people is sufficiently strong, will he genuinely try to modify the proposals in the interests of the people that we represent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear when I launched the consultation on trust reconfiguration, to which I assume the hon. Gentleman refers, that if better proposals than ours are presented, we shall listen to them carefully. However, I cannot examine one area in isolation from the rest of Wales. Through the exercise, we are trying to form a rational approach to strategic development of services in Wales, through which I believe that we can save between£7 million and£10 million. All of that money can go directly into patient care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Child Care Strategy</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>3. 
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has received following the publication of the national child care strategy for Wales. [18381]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the successful launch of the child care strategy for Wales on 22 June, several hon. Members tabled parliamentary questions, and I have met my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan). The Welsh Office has received a small number of inquiries. The strategy was published for consultation, and I hope that we shall receive many comments before the closing date of 31 August.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that reply and welcome the strategy. Understandably, it largely reflects the approach of the White Paper of a couple of months ago. Are the spending plans in the Welsh strategy proportionately equivalent to those for the English proposals and, more importantly, is my hon. Friend confident that the resources will be adequate, particularly for the provision of decent quality child care in our more deprived communities and our more sparsely populated areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure my hon. Friend that while the strategy is part of the overall United Kingdom child care strategy, we shall develop it specifically to meet Welsh needs. We have already substantially increased the funding available this year and we will get a proportionate share—more than£14 million of the national lottery new opportunities fund. I assure my hon. Friend that the available resources will be sufficient to provide quality child care in all parts of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Rhuddlan Borough Council</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>4. 
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on the financial position of Rhuddlan borough council following local government reorganisation. [48382]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following local government reorganisation, the assets, rights and liabilities of Rhuddlan borough council were transferred to Denbighshire county council. The district auditor, in his public interest report, which was published in July last year, confirmed that the debt that was transferred from Rhuddlan borough council was significantly higher than anticipated. For that reason, the Welsh Office provided additional financial help to mitigate the potential effects of that debt on services and council tax payers in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. Will he consider a public inquiry onto Rhuddlan borough council debts? I ask that for two reasons. First, the people of Denbighshire deserve and should have a public inquiry so that a full explanation of what went on can be given. Secondly, the people of Wales need to learn the lessons from that fiasco, which involved the misuse of European grants, before the advent of objective 1 status for Wales in 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the district auditor first looked at the accounts he did not pick up the problem. However, it was picked up soon afterwards, and, as a result, we asked the Audit Commission to undertake a quality control review of the auditor' s role. That was done by an independent auditor from the private sector, who found that the district auditor had acted in accordance with the code of practice laid down by Parliament. I am aware that a Mr. Gwynn Clague, who has set up a new party called the Democratic Alliance of Wales, has made allegations concerning European funding. The district auditor has asked Mr Clague to meet him to discuss the allegations, but he has yet not come for that meeting or produce the evidence for the district auditor. I do not see any value at this stage in a public inquiry, but if further evidence were presented to suggest that there had been even greater mismanagement than of the other funding, I would consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (
	<i>Translation</i>): I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane). I also emphasise the seriousness of the financial situation in Denbighshire. Will the Welsh Office keep a close eye on that situation, which is of grave concern to my electorate because it tends to undermine confidence in the system of local government in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that we are keeping a close eye on the developing situation in Denbighshire. We have asked for twice-yearly reports on the management of capital spending in the area, and the Welsh Office has already made provision to help Denbighshire with the problems of Rhuddlan that arose from the successor authority's taking over. My hon. Friend can be absolutely reassured that, as the story unfolds, we will take whatever steps are necessary in terms of the debts of Rhuddlan borough council and the management of the various European funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Anti-smoking Education</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>5. 
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What research he has evaluated on the impact of anti-smoking education on the numbers of (a) female and (b) male teenagers smoking in the years 1988 to 1996. [48383]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Primary responsibility for evaluating the impact of anti-smoking education in Wales rests with Health Promotion Wales. It has a programme of surveys and research aimed at informing the development of anti-smoking education measures and evaluating their impact. Since 1988, it has produced numerous reports based on this research programme,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
many of which focus on the impact of anti-smoking education on teenagers of both sexes. A further two research projects have been grant aided directly by the Wales Office of Research and Development. Those are helping to inform action on future anti-smoking education measures, including the development of the Government's forthcoming White Paper on tobacco control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. It was full and informative, which is not always the case with parliamentary answers—not even from this enlightened Government. Can my hon. Friend explain why, although the sums spent in Scotland and Wales are virtually comparable, smoking among teenage girls has remained static in Scotland but has risen by 50 per cent. in Wales since 1988? Although the number of deaths from illegal drugs is distressing—any death is a tragedy and there have been 19 deaths too many—during the past four years there have been 29,000 deaths from legal drugs. Does not my hon. Friend think that we should constantly reassess the value of the anti-smoking and the anti-drug education that we offer young people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I reassure my hon. Friend that, among other things, I have asked Health Promotion Wales to review the effectiveness of its work. Although the education programmes on smoking show that 95 per cent. of youngsters are aware of the dangers of smoking, I am concerned that there has been a rise in smoking, particularly among 15 and 16-year-old girls. We are currently reassessing matters, to find out whether we are failing to get the message across. That could have an impact on the smoking habits of teenage girls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the White Paper on tobacco control is published, I know that my hon. Friend will be active in suggesting ways to help tackle the tobacco question. Like my hon. Friend, on the wider question, I am mindful of the number of deaths that have resulted from both illegal and legal drugs, and we shall certainly take steps in both fields to try to minimise the possibility of further tragedies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a spirit of good will, I shall not go down the route of Bernie Ecclestone or Formula One— [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Do hon. Members wish me to?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that I own a convenience store that sells tobacco products, I can only wish the Government well in their strategy to reduce tobacco consumption. The European Union still subsidises tobacco growing to the tune of 1 billion ecu a year, which is wrong. Does not the Minister agree that that sends the wrong signal to people, whether they are young or old? What action will the British Government take to get rid of the subsidies for tobacco products throughout Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Effective action will be taken at European Union level on tobacco advertising, which will limit it and eventually abolish it altogether. On the wider issue of subsidies for the production of tobacco plants, it is one of the matters being considered within the Agenda 2000 proposals and the reform of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
common agricultural policy. The Government want action on those subsidies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gwent health authority evaluated options including the establishment of separate trusts for north and south Gwent. After extensive local discussions, it recommended the single trust option. Following careful consideration of all the options, I concluded that this proposal had the best potential to offer improved patient care and secure value for money. The public consultation period lasts until 21 September and I shall consider all responses before reaching a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. On the Government's own tests, the current proposal for a single mega-trust for the whole of Gwent fails. It fails on the principle of local autonomy for local health groups because it is the primary care providers who are most opposed to it; it fails on the principle of collaboration between health and social services because the campaign for separate trusts has been spearheaded by the chairs of social services in Blaenau Gwent and Monmouthshire; and it fails on the principle of accountability because the local authority and the community health council in north Gwent believe that accountability can be improved if there is a separate trust in north Gwent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All those arguments have been put forward in the consultation period. I shall consider all the arguments and I am happy to consult on the evidence of Gwent health authority and the group that I put together to consider the proposal. If it can be shown that a two-trust option would provide a better service to patients and a saving of more money to put directly into patient care, I shall obviously consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We shall be making clear our priorities for the road network when we publish our review of the roads programme before the end of this month.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no point in improving links in one part of north Wales without improving them further south. There is a bottleneck, of which the Minister is aware: the single-track road south of Wrexham—the A483 and the A5—which, to pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), has killed 25 people in the past five years. I have asked this question before and it has aroused enormous interest in north-east Wales: can the Minister give us an assurance that he will give that scheme priority in the White Paper to be issued next month?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's question—that is not always the case with his questions. It is certainly true that the point that he has identified is widely recognised. It is certainly recognised in the Welsh Office and we will do our best to address it within the extremely limited—not to say puny—resources with which the Conservative Government left us in the transport and roads budget— [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman shrugs his shoulders, but the transport budget was halved under the previous Government, which has made it difficult for us to tackle precisely such problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am familiar with what the Minister says about resources. The A470 is the main road from north to south Wales and great improvements have been made to it here, at Merthyr Tydfil, but none the less, many bottlenecks remain, including the one at Dolwyddelan, which I am glad to say is being dealt with. When the Minister produces his document, will he include a strategy to tackle the bottlenecks and pinch points on the A470? There have been three lorry collisions in the past year in my constituency because the road is not wide enough, one of which was nearly fatal when a lorry completely burnt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the launch of the west Wales pathfinder in January and the roll out to the rest of Wales in April, more than 1,400 employers have signed up for the new deal for 18 to 24-year-olds, with a further 800 expected to sign up in the next three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. Despite the prophets of doom in the Tory party and the criticisms of the new deal by peripheral parties such as the Welsh nationalists in my constituency, the new deal is widely welcomed. However, there have been problems with its implementation because of the lack of public transport. It is no good our having all the jobs in the world at LG in Newport for people who live in Markam, in my constituency, who have no transport and so simply cannot get there. I ask my hon. Friend to consider that matter, which presents a serious problem throughout Wales, and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we provide adequate public transport linked to new deal schemes, so that we can ensure the wholesale success of the new deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's point; we are dealing with that issue. Some bus companies have offered free or heavily subsidised transport for new dealers. I pay tribute to the work that my hon. Friend has done in his constituency, which is a model for the work that hon. Members can do locally with the Employment Service to implement the new deal. That work is much appreciated by those involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> (

	<div class='membercontribution'>: To follow up that question, I ask the Under-Secretary to ensure that there will be permanent posts for those who take advantage of the new deal and that they will have employment of some value, employment that will pay all right and employment in their own community? The new deal is all right in itself, but for young people to be confident, it must meet certain requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are anxious to ensure that the new deal results in long-term employment for all those who are on it. Indeed, it has been characteristic of the new deal that a higher proportion than we expected of those entering the gateway have been able to go straight into jobs, without even going through the six-month subsidised job option. That has been most encouraging and we want it to continue, although it is clearly not in a Minister's gift to guarantee anyone full-time employment, permanent or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>New Economic Agenda for Wales</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>11.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ron Davies)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the new economic agenda for Wales.</p></blockquote>
I am delighted that the Welsh Grand Committee is meeting in Merthyr Tydfil. You will recall, Mr. Jones, that our programme of meetings so far has given us a glimpse of the geography of Wales. We had our first meeting at Mold in the north, we then went to Carmarthen in the west, and today we are in Merthyr Tydfil, in the heart of the south Wales valleys. I hope that the way in which we have moved around Wales has benefited hon. Members and the communities that we have visited, and that there will be opportunities to visit other areas of Wales in the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the start of our proceedings, Mr. Jones, you paid tribute to the officers and staff of Merthyr Tydfil county borough council and to the people of Merthyr Tydfil for their hospitality. I should like to add my thanks for the ready co-operation that we at the Welsh Office have experienced from the people of Merthyr Tydfil and the members and staff of the county borough council. My hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) referred earlier to the Wales new deal and we should in fact give the people of Merthyr Tydfil a double "Thank you", because the town is also hosting the Wales new deal advisory task force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of today's debate is the Welsh economy, specifically the agenda that I launched last Tuesday with the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain). That agenda aims to take the economy forward and to spread prosperity throughout Wales. It is fitting that such a debate should take place here in Merthyr Tydfil, a town that exemplifies both the economic successes of the past and, unfortunately, the economic anxieties of the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the turn of the century, Merthyr Tydfil had an international reputation as the bustling and innovative epicentre of the coal and steel industries. It now finds itself too often portrayed in the media as a capital of unemployment and sickness. That sort of decline will be familiar to many hon. Members who represent other parts of Wales. However, it is far from being the whole picture, and it must be set alongside more positive experiences such as the attraction of inward investment, the continued strength and variety of our manufacturing plants, the persistence and the success of our modern steel industry and the growth of new sectors such as information technology, film and animation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite those successes, it is evident that we are not yet free of the virus of decline. It clings to us tenaciously and can recur suddenly and unexpectedly, often after long periods of economic good health. We have come a long way from the crises of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, when so much of Wales' traditional employment disappeared. However, a great deal remains to be done. I pay tribute to the "Team Wales" spirit, which has done so much in practical
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
terms to get Wales back on its feet. To continue with the motoring analogy, our approach so far has got Wales off the economic hard shoulder and back into the traffic flow, but at present we are doing no more than making progress up the slow lane—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I can hear the unmistakable sound of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) behind me, and I welcome his intervention. I assure him that we are out of the slip road and in the slow lane—we must now move into the fast lane.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to lay once and for all the ghosts of decline and self-doubt that continue to haunt significant parts of our economy, but we cannot do so in a few months or in a year or two. On taking office last year, the Government faced an horrendous task in terms of the macro-economy and the need to develop a new agenda for Wales. We will do what we can in the months that remain before the establishment of the National Assembly next year, but the task will primarily be for the new assembly to tackle. It will certainly have to continue at the outset with the work that we are setting in train. Our new economic agenda represents the first step in getting the Welsh economy back on track and up to speed, turning it into a world-class economy with firms that specialise in high-quality goods and services. Wales' image as a low-cost nation must be buried once and for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I turn to the agenda, I should like to speak generally for a few moments about modern Wales and its place in the world, because that is the context in which we must turn the agenda into action. It is vital that we do not lose sight of the rich diversity that is to be found throughout Wales. The economic issues that affect one part of the country are very different from those that may affect another. Wales is a country of both urban and rural communities. South-east Wales, southwest Wales, north-east Wales and mid Wales all have distinctive economies. The country has great diversity and each community must address its own needs and identify its own opportunities if it is to offer the best prospects to the Welsh people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The variety of Wales cannot be dealt with by central planning alone. The Government's agenda recognises variety across Wales by setting out what can be done at the all-Wales level while giving the opportunity for local variations to be decided by local authorities or individual communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I celebrate local individuality, I cannot accept that prospects in one part of Wales should be substantially and continuously worse than those elsewhere. Unfortunately, during the past 15 years, some people have felt that the ploughing of money, resources, expertise and energy into south-east Wales will somehow make the area carry the rest of Wales with it. I do not make that as a partisan point to Conservative Members. I reject the argument, as does the Government's entire strategy. It cannot be to the greater good of Wales that the gross domestic product of one area can be twice as much as that of another, or that prosperity can be so concentrated in a few areas, while much of Wales—especially the valleys and west Wales—continues to perform poorly. That is one of the central issues that must be addressed. I want to make it clear at the outset that the Welsh Office recognises that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
central problem and that it has prepared an agenda that deals specifically with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Tuesday, the European Commission formally announced its decision to designate west Wales and the south Wales valleys as one nomenclature of units of territorial statistics 2 area and the remainder of Wales as another. In one sense, that decision is good news, but it is bad news in another, because it recognises the reality of changed economic circumstances and the disparity within the Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now an east-west divide, rather than the historic north-south divide. The Government have consistently pressed that point with the Commission and we will continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the news that Eurostat has accepted the new NUTS 2 map for Wales. Will the Secretary of State assure the Committee that if the change leads to the securing of objective 1 money, which I think is his hope as well as mine, that funding will be additional to current Welsh Office and Welsh block expenditure? Will he assure the Committee that if a sum of matching funds is necessary during the period from 2000 to 2006, additional money will be provided over and above the Barnett formula, and that the change will not be at the expense of health and education services in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks, for a simple and practical reason. If the Government obtain objective 1 funding, the success will occur during the lifetime of the National Assembly for Wales. I shall say a little more about that in a moment. The right hon. Gentleman has pressed me hard on the matter many times and he will know that it will be for the National Assembly to decide its own priorities. It may decide to give greater priority to using resources available from Europe via objective 1 funding. That could tilt the pattern of expenditure that the assembly establishes. I cannot, therefore, comment on the matter, or give the right hon. Gentleman the guarantee that he seeks. We are not in a position to negotiate at that level with the Treasury. However, the Government have negotiated the understanding of devolution and of the National Assembly on the basis that the Barnett formula will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman is arguing that a case should be put to the Treasury for more resources, I must reply that that argument can be made only when objective 1 funding has been established. Whoever is in the Welsh Office and the National Assembly for Wales at the time will have to press the matter with the Treasury. I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that I regard the granting of objective 1 status as a once-ina-generation opportunity for us. Much experience can be gained from Ireland, which has been used as an example of what can be done. I was intrigued to note that in Ireland, only 35 per cent. of the available funds have been drawn down, with great success; much more could have been drawn down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to do two things in the coming months: first, to ensure that our case to the European Commission for objective 1 funding is pursued as comprehensively, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
professionally and as vigorously as possible. I remind the Committee that Eurostat's acknowledgement of our NUTS 2 submission is a necessary prerequisite, but of itself it does not guarantee that we will receive objective 1 funding, so the campaign will have to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we must consider all the available experience in this country, in Ireland and throughout Europe to ensure that we learn lessons from those areas that have benefited from objective 1 funding. We must ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place so that if, at the end of the year, we are successful in getting objective 1 funding, which comes on tap at the end of the following year, we will get the maximum benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) raised an interesting point which will have to be pursued in future. I regret that I cannot give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he asked for, but I know that he will accept my answer in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that the world outside Wales has changed. We are increasingly a regional economy within a European structure. A focus on the regions within Europe is gradually replacing the concept of a Europe of nation states, and I welcome that development. When we establish our National Assembly for Wales, we must ensure that we have a Europe-friendly internal structure so that we can best represent Wales effectively and with confidence at the European level. Even before the assembly has been established, we have earned the praise of Commission officials for our work in Wales in respect of the regional technology plan and the Wales information society. As we gain confidence and take our place in Europe and the world, it is more important than ever that we give the world a strong and accurate impression of what characterises modern Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was with a sense of disappointment that I realised that we would not reach question 14. I took great comfort from the comprehensive and professional way in which my two colleagues dealt with the questions, especially in view of the fast bowling that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), had to field. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) wanted to ask a question about branding, a matter which he has followed with great personal interest. I have no doubt that he will want to catch your eye later, Mr. Jones, to make his own comments on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased, a few weeks ago, to lend my support to the launch of "Wales—The Time is Now" a publication developed by business and non-departmental public body interests throughout Wales. It sets out good advice on the positive way in which we should represent Wales to the world. I encourage all who represent Wales, and all the people in the Committee and outside it at all levels, to follow the guidance of that publication. The more of us from Wales who speak with the same voice, the louder and clearer our message will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only on branding matters that we should speak with one voice and be of one mind. I am delighted that we have been able to build such a consensus in respect of our economic agenda. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Neath was determined that we would produce an early
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
consultation document, which he published last autumn. It has played a crucial role in building the present consensus. It gave a wide range of individuals and organisations the chance to put forward their ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful and constructive debate in Wales in the past months; whenever possible, useful and positive suggestions have been incorporated into the agenda that we launched last week. I have no doubt that it is because of that process of consensus-building and consultation that we had such a warm welcome from all parts of Wales when the agenda was launched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am equally confident that, between us, we have now got the prescription right. This is a model for the way in which the assembly will enable all interests to work together for the good of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the context; before I turn to the agenda, I inform the Committee that I intend to speak only briefly. This is a crucial time in the development of the politics, society and economy of Wales. It is right that I should have the opportunity to listen to the contributions and observations of my colleagues in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given what I have said already, it will come as no surprise that the document has much to say about spreading economic activity throughout Wales. Measures such as better promotion of regional selective assistance and other state aids, the creation of a new arm of the Welsh Office in west Wales and the reworking of the food strategy will help spread the balance of activity more evenly. That is especially important in the valleys and west Wales, but we must not forget the distinctive problems facing rural mid-Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prosperity will not reach those areas as a result of any single panacea. It will arrive gradually, with a balance of ingredients. In some cases, we must rely on inward investment; in others, on the development of indigenous companies. Elsewhere, teleworking and the establishment of call centres will be the key, and in still other areas we must develop more agriculture-related activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no Wales-wide panacea or prescription. However, we can lay out the strategy at an all-Wales level and ensure that resources follow our priorities. We will then be in a position to enable local communities to reflect their needs and circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State's strategy use the powerhouse to ensure that added value is given to agricultural products in particular? At present, we export low-value, basic livestock to be processed elsewhere. Will the powerhouse have a strategy to deal with that problem and create greater employment in rural areas in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powerhouse has two distinct advantages that the old system lacked. First, the new body is a unified, all-Wales body. The powers of the Welsh Development Agency, the Land Authority for Wales and the Development Board for Rural Wales were not available at an all-Wales level, but they will be. I know that the hon. Gentleman has put pressure on the DBRW to get involved in the work that he has described, so I am sure that he will welcome at least the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
principle of the proposed reorganisation, which is that the wider powers should be available at an all-Wales level. Secondly, the new structure involves the creation of a rural policy unit. It will have a strong base in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, and I have no doubt that it will serve us well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) also mentioned agriculture and food policy. I have made it clear that I have not been happy with the promotion of Welsh agriculture and foodstuffs. That service must be improved fundamentally. I am holding wide-ranging discussions with several interested parties and I hope that I shall be able to make a clear and positive announcement, if not next week then in the nottoo-distant future, about how we propose to make that improvement. However, although I regret that I cannot do so today, as delicate discussions are being held at a number of levels, I am determined to bring those discussions to a successful conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was making was that Wales needs a broad-based economy. The agenda before the Committee today is designed to provide that. It is clear to anyone who reads the document that the theme of social inclusiveness runs through it. It is not acceptable that people should be excluded from the work place against their wishes. The agenda offers a range of policies to prevent that: help with child care or caring responsibilities, training, and the introduction of people into the workplace through the new deal or voluntary work. Those policies have a double benefit: as well as helping the individuals at whom they are principally targeted, they will also help to build a stronger and broader Welsh economy by releasing the latent talent of all the people, instead of depending only on those who are fortunate enough to live in the right area at the right time, or to have the right social support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must draw the Committee's attention to two important new structural developments. In the autumn, we shall be issuing detailed proposals for reforming Business Connect. They will build on what has already been achieved, but they will also strengthen the local consortiums and add an all-Wales level of co-ordination to their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, we have decided to apply that successful approach to technology and business. The Welsh Development Agency will be charged with coordinating the production of an all-Wales action plan, which will take into account all relevant aspects and identify a range of actions to ensure that Wales becomes a nation of entrepreneurs. I hope that we can have a constructive debate on the proposals this morning. Perhaps it is time for others to comment on the agenda—on what they see as its strengths and weaknesses, or on where they think it should be implemented most vigorously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have called our document "Pathway to Prosperity: A New Economic Agenda for Wales". I hope that when the whole of Wales sets its mind to the task, we will be able to follow that path to a more prosperous Wales. There is a sense in Wales that a new agenda is developing. We have a new politics—next year there will be new and different political structures. There is a new confidence in Wales and an understanding that the new Wales must be characterised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
by confidence, innovation and, above all, quality. Our document sets out the way in which we can achieve that. I commend it to the Committee and hope that it receives a warm reception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak in Welsh for at least the first part of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Merthyr Tydfil should consider a document that creates a strong economy in Wales. As Committee members know, this area has been historically important, first with its heavy industry and, following that, with inward investment from foreign companies, Japanese companies in particular. There is no doubt that Merthyr crystallises the great changes in the economy of Wales in the past quarter of a century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, living on the edge is on the increase in Wales. It was said that one of the most astonishing aspects of the emergency in Wales is its invisibility—one will not see it on the main street during a rugby match, nor in the new supermarkets that have grown like mushrooms here in Wales, nor on the numerous golf courses throughout Wales. One will see it outside secondary schools or on street corners at Porth in the Rhondda and Bangor in Gwynnedd. The emergency involves high unemployment and an over-dependence on benefits. Those communities are excellent examples of the social deprivation to which the Government referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Child Poverty Action Group defines social deprivation as people living in poverty and being unable to participate in the usual way in the society to which they belong because of their low levels of resources. Our education system is failing, which means that thousands of young people are leaving school each year without achieving their potential. They have no idea of their future and no direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, it is very difficult to break away from that culture of over-dependence on benefits and a lack of vision. A whole generation of young people nowadays are born in environments of social deprivation, which surely reinforces the fact that they will underperform in schools and go on to unemployment or low-paid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the worst housing stock in Europe, yet we are on the threshold of the golden age of the new millennium. Fewer people in Wales own cars and ownership of fridges is the lowest in Europe, yet millions of pounds are being spent on the dome. Again, it is the worst scenario. There is more ill health in Wales—for example, respiratory and cardiac problems and diabetes. Pupils fail in schools, children and young people have serious emotional problems, and we also have drug abuse and associated offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in Ukraine a few years ago and I noticed that a bottle of Vodka cost less than £1 while a loaf cost more than that. When I asked why that was so, the amused reply was that if people had a bottle of vodka in their stomach it did not matter they had no food. That may not be directly relevant to what we are discussing today, but unfortunately I hear an echo of the drug situation in what was said. There is a feeling of despair. Possibly
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
people are turning to drugs to get away from that. Obviously, serious social problems need to be solved here in Wales. Drugs are a major problem, I asked about overuse of drugs through medical prescriptions. Drugs are prescribed as an easy solution to the problems. Thousands of people are taking drugs that they should not be taking because of the apathy of certain doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employment and activity levels are low. For example, the figures are 69 per cent. for Anglesey and 68 per cent for Blaenau Gwent. Salaries are low, the number of part-time workers has grown immensely and there is some evidence that more women are now employed—alas, the prejudice continues. Gross domestic product in Wales is lower than anywhere else in the UK—it is 62 per cent. in mid Wales, which is the lowest European percentage, 68 per cent. in Dyfed and 72 per cent. in Gwynedd. I have already described the main reasons for that: low wages, poor health, unemployment and low levels of activity. It is a cliché to say that we should do something to change that and prevent Wales from becoming a poor third world country. Yes we will have devolution and important opportunities as a result. British policies have hit us hard in Wales in the past. The Secretary of State referred to that in his opening remarks. The raw materials of this country were ignored as well as the fact that in some parts of the country we have a different economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon will argue that we ignore certain areas of the economy. Some of them are overheated and other parts far from that. There is a difference between growth rates in service industries and in the manufacturing and the agricultural sectors. Employment levels vary in different parts of the United Kingdom, as do house prices. Therefore, the gap between poorer and richer people is wider now than in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that substantial Government investment is targeted at underprivileged areas. As the Secretary of State for Wales said, Wales has various economies. One of our most important weapons is carefully targeted public spending. (
	<i>The speaker continued in English</i>). The Welsh economy is probably more dependant on public spending that many other regional economies. Indeed, Professor John Lovering of Cardiff university made that point very well in his recent paper entitled "Constructing the Welsh Economy: changing perspectives on regional economic development." In a section entitled "Wales's unfashionable reality: the dependence on public spending" he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The public sector is a key factor sustaining living standards in rural areas and the west of Wales. In many localities farming still employs up to a quarter of the workforce—often at extremely low wages or with unpaid family labour. The public sector is key—sometimes the only—source of better paid jobs, not to mention the services provided, in such areas. Even less often noticed is the role of public-spending in sustaining the affluent professional classes in the South East of Wales. The BBC, HTV, S4C, WDA, Welsh Office, Universities, Hospitals and local authorities—"</p></blockquote>
I hope that includes everyone. I might have left someone out—I will think about that over lunch. However, those are not my words: it is Professor Lovering who is making the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Public spending funds much of what appears to be independent business, not least the army of consultants used by the Welsh Office and the Welsh Development Agency as a consequence of inadequate in-house research capacity. The salaries of those people who insist that Wales has been transformed by private investment very often come from public spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the White Paper. Clearly it is well-meant and an improvement on the consultation document that was published in October. It contains a useful analysis of the difficulties confronting the Welsh economy. Evidently, the consultation process has involved some listening and that, of course, is most welcome. However, the White Paper contains some serious gaps. The problems of rural Wales and the agricultural crisis do not deserve the scant attention that they receive. I welcome some of the White Paper's conclusions and also the priority given to assisting organic farming. Professor Terry Marsden recently dealt with that subject in a paper entitled "Setting an Agenda for the Assembly".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Wales has only 19 organic farms? Given that that represents such a small proportion of the agricultural industry, it will take a long time to make progress in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We must prioritise the matter. As I mentioned, the White Paper makes organic farming a priority and I hope that that will be backed up by action and resources. Professor Marsden's paper makes a considerable input in that area. I commend it to hon. Members and to anyone who is interested in the subject. The professor addresses a matter that is being researched by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs: the all-important balance between inward investment, FDI—foreign direct investment—and nurturing and investing in indigenous growth. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Following some of the principles of the Regional Technology Plan, the strategy needs to develop an innovation plan for the Welsh food industry, which both considers how new indigenous business can be supported and created and how Welsh producers and food business can participate in the wider national and international markets."</p></blockquote>
That is a very important point. The professor also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The food strategy will need to address quite radically the diversification of the Welsh agricultural base."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman gives such evident credibility to the views of Professor Terry Marsden.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows that the right hon. Gentleman has some good help. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps I am preaching to the converted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The document offers useful input for our debate. In relation to that, I welcome the extended remit of the new WDA and I trust that a realistic and attainable Welsh food strategy will be put in place as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourism is one of the most important industries in Wales. It employs almost 100,000 people and is a true growth area. The document states that the Wales tourist board is to prepare a new strategy for tourism in Wales to take the industry into the new millennium. That sound fine, but if there is a grain of truth in the 
	<i>Western Mail article of 8 July,</i> we have to question whether the board has the ability to do so. The criticisms of the board come at a time when a poor season has been followed by a worse one. However, we cannot blame everything on the weather. The WTB is making savage internal staff cuts; the cuts are savage because of the way in which they are being made, and because the board is expected to exist on an ever-decreasing budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the importance of the tourist industry for Wales, should not we consider a fundamental change for the board? For example, perhaps the Scottish model might lend itself to the Welsh situation. Is there still a case for a free-standing Wales tourist board? Could a tourism arm—along the lines of the tourism functions of Highlands and Islands Enterprise—be built into the enlarged WDA? The Wales tourist board would then have only an enhanced public relations and marketing role. I raise that issue in the hope that it will initiate debate. The industry is of great importance to us and we cannot allow matters relating to it to drift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document refers to money being put into the Welsh economy, but it does not discuss the way that money flows out from disadvantaged areas, especially through the retailing and banking sectors. Supermarkets need to become much more sensitive to the needs of the areas that they serve. They should put far greater emphasis on sourcing from local suppliers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sustainable development is mentioned at 5.69 in the document, and that is most welcome. However, the document fails to offer any real commitment, for example, to renewable energy, or to energy policy generally. A clause in the Government of Wales Bill obliges the assembly to draw up a scheme to promote sustainable energy. Although that is a positive step, it must not be left as an afterthought when the Welsh Office and the WDA have sorted out economic strategy. A sustainable development strategy is, above all, an economic strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Little is said about money in the document. We are told that we must await the Government's comprehensive spending review, and that is understandable. However, the funding for the assembly must adequately meet the needs of Wales, based on a re-examination of the Barnett formula and a real investigation of such matters as the state of school buildings, rural bus services, or the numbers of people suffering from long-term illness. Some of that money is needed for economic development, but it must be spread evenly throughout Wales and not concentrated in the south-east and the north-east corners. For example, development bodies in Ireland have specific targets to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
meet in rural areas and out west. Wales could learn and benefit from that example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Welsh Office faced a problem because the document was produced before the spending review determined the assembly's budget. The document also predates the transport White Paper and the new energy policy. Therefore, it cannot commit itself on the three most fundamental points to any economy—the transport system, energy supply and money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We look forward to the assembly leading to the democratisation of economic policy in Wales. That is bound to involve representation of areas in Wales that have not received much economic assistance. They will demand their fair share, and I am sure that that will happen. The process must also include making quangos accountable. Therefore, I was pleased to see the comments of Lord Williams of Mostyn on the Report stage of the Government of Wales Bill on 1 July. In column 805 in the debate in the other place he suggested that the monitoring of quangos and making appointments to their boards is likely to be a matter for the subject committees of the assembly and should not be left to officials and secretaries. That is essential if the assembly is to deliver a democratic and effective economic strategy for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April 1998, almost 70,800 people in Wales were registered as unemployed and one could add more than 50,000 to that list if one used a different method to calculate unemployment. A huge problem needs to be tackled, and that represents a challenge. In spite of possibly limited and inadequate powers, the assembly will have to meet the challenge of identifying and funding an economic development programme that is capable of delivering equitable and sustainable growth. That programme must have sustainable development at its heart and it must break the bottlenecks that cause social exclusion and dependency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme must prioritise the needs of the disadvantaged in the valleys, in rural Wales and in depressed city areas. It must ensure that minorities, women and disadvantaged groups have equal access to all opportunities and it must encourage the educational changes that are needed to train people in suitable skills so that we can take advantage of new technologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme must also shift investment towards the domestic economy and develop an inward investment strategy that complements that and makes the most effective use of promotional funds so that we can attract companies that are willing to make a longterm commitment to sectors that will sustain national economic regeneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there is no single route to economic development or job creation. We must have a multifaceted approach. However, the benefits should be spread more evenly in geographical and social terms. If jobs are created, they must respond to the needs and strengths of each specific area. They are then more likely to be long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru produced a document, "100,000 Answers" that gave answers to numerous problems. It is not definitive—I do not pretend that we have the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
monopoly on wisdom—but it provided an important input into the debate. The document highlighted the fact that Wales could benefit immensely from the development of renewable energy. We have many natural features that would make that possible. The assembly could build an energy strategy that builds on those advantages by encouraging, for example, the manufacture and export of blades and towers for windmills and that would enable us to provide the architectural expertise that is required. I am pleased that the document refers to the wiring up of Wales. The sooner that is done, the better: it will create opportunities for e-mail trading and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The areas with the greatest job shortfalls are those that face the biggest problems in health care and social services. Those problems can be solved by providing care for the elderly, children and other disadvantaged groups, because that would lead to a considerable expansion in employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude, much to the relief of the Chairman and others in the Committee, no doubt, by noting that the document is well intentioned. Of that there is no doubt. However, it is without any financial commitment. If new Labour is to remain constrained by the awful inheritance that we hear about, day in and day out, the Tory spending straitjacket will continue to squeeze, and today's exercise and the document will be of no profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman and his cronies—I mean colleagues—must see the necessity of breaking free from the self-imposed and anti-social shackles that were devised by Millbank for the needs of the south-east and for middle England. Otherwise, the document will go down in history as the greatest wish list ever, and nothing more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I also warmly welcome colleagues on the Grand Committee. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State rightly said in his opening observations that there was no more appropriate place in which to discuss a new economic agenda than Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I think Neath is second division. This town and these communities seem, when one reviews the century's economic history, to have gone through all the economic experiences and related emotions that could be devised by modern industrial man. On the question of self-doubt, which has been raised this morning, I should mention that a gentleman who stopped me in the street on my way here, to comment on the wonderful sunny weather, said, "I see from the weather forecast, Mr. Rowlands, that we are in between depressions, like the Merthyr economy." The communities of Merthyr Tydfil, Dowlais and Rhymney would, in the first quarter of the century, have been described as the tiger economies of the western world, if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
language had been used in that way then. In this century the community has had 16,000 miners dealing with 3 million tonnes of coal, but we are left with Tower colliery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is talk of global economy, as if the idea of the global economy influencing or affecting our communities is a new concept. As one of my hon. Friends said, south Wales was an integral part of a global economy and a major influence in it, with a dominant share of the European coal market. Rail linked Dowlais to south America. The collapse in 1930 of the Dowlais works was related to the failure of an Egyptian rail order. We understand the global economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor of the Exchequer talks about stop-go and boom and slump; this is a society that knows what they are all about. Within a decade of its peak performance, just after the first world war, it changed from one of the boom economies of the western world to a community with 65 per cent. of the insured working population out of work; a place that 20,000 of the 80,000 population—the youngest, ablest and fittest—left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the terms "boom" and "slump", we understand the terms "regeneration" and "empowerment". It has not been fully appreciated that in the post-war world, Merthyr Tydfil and other valley economies reinvented themselves, not only in the tradition of coal and iron but through a completely new manufacturing experience. Before the war those economies were societies of pits and works—not factory societies, which are a relatively new experience for the Welsh economy. We reinvented ourselves around the new, manufacturing-based inward investment in post-war Wales. That is important. The figures are astonishing. In the 1920s and 1930s only 11 per cent. of the Merthyr population worked in manufacturing. By the mid-1950s and 1960s, that figure had risen to 40 per cent. but it is now back down to 27 or 28 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been through amazing changes and it is worth reminding ourselves—even though it is unfashionable—how the regeneration was built. It was not built on the language of communitarian empowerment, much in vogue at the moment. It was the result of the best partnership of all—the power of the state allied to public expenditure, inward investment and local authority initiative. That was what recreated the post-war economy of south Wales. The people of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney were empowered not only by themselves and their trade union movement but by the state and the power of government. It may be unfashionable to say that nowadays, but it is worth reminding ourselves that that is how it happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then came a forfeit—the cruellest of all because we were through the worst. We thought that after 70-plus years of fluctuating fortunes the worst was behind us, but we were then hit by recession in the 1980s. The worst word of that decade was the horrible "downsizing"—and we were downsized. Pits may have closed under Labour Governments, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley reminded us, but the 1980s saw the biggest closure programme ever. We lost four pits inside five years, the last of our coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
We lost not only our pits but a sizeable chunk of our manufacturing base: we lost Thorn's and we lost Hymax in Rhymney—the economic heart of that community. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon referred to Hoover, which was downsized from a peak of 5,400 jobs to fewer than 1,000. That was the double whammy—not just the closure of pits but the corrosion, erosion and collapse of parts of our manufacturing industry whose consequences are so vividly described in chapter 3 of the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 3 applies to Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. It refers to another term, the dependency culture, which I hate because we all depend on each other, so we should use it only as a short-hand phrase for what we all know it means. Perhaps only 2,000 people were formally registered unemployed but about 10,000 people of working age were economically inactive in my area. We certainly did not volunteer to be part of the dependency culture. It is sometimes implied that we were happy and wallowing in our dependency, but it was imposed on us for reasons beyond our control, and now we have to pick up the pieces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approach the document with a sense of history, which is entirely reasonable. We do not want to be prisoners to our history or fail to see the new radical features that may be ahead of us. We need to learn from the 20th century economic history of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, which will help us to assess the document in the light of our experience as well as our needs and requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State failed to mention the two most astonishing facts in the document. I do not criticise him for that but I am surprised that he did not address them. To create a stable, rational and widespread prosperity, we need an extra 200,000 jobs in the Welsh economy. That is the first time since "Wales: The Way Ahead"—only a few of us are old enough to remember it—that a jobs gap has been publicly endorsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well remember "Wales: The Way Ahead" being published in 1967, when 40,000 Welsh people were officially unemployed and nearer 100,000 economically inactive. Yet only 15,000 jobs were specified as the target to be achieved. Let us hope that it will be more this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I want to draw the attention of the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee to the enormity of the task of creating an extra 200,000 jobs. Considering the employment patterns of the work force of Wales over the past 25 or 30 years, even in good times, the required level of achievement has not been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Confederation of British Industry's document gives another figure for achieving the average United Kingdom prosperity level which my right hon. and hon. Friends may or may not endorse as an accurate assessment. It states that the Welsh economy will have to grow by 0.5 per cent. per annum over and above UK growth. Those are two astonishing targets, two awesome challenges. I am bound to ask myself whether the document addresses those demands and objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary: I admire my right hon. Friend's courage in presenting us with the brutal truth about aspects of the Welsh economy. The best part of the document is its candid character. But we must question whether its proposals match the awesome challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain why I believe the document does respond to our needs. First, the chapter on the new deal, on breaking the welfare-to-work trap that people are in, and the whole idea of a minimum wage and tax-work credits and so on, is one of the most innovative and imaginative efforts that the Chancellor of the Exchequer could have made to address the concept of the so-called dependency culture. The whole policy and its funding, rightly, by a windfall tax, is essential, and I commend it. We shall make it work on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I have no dispute with the host of micro-measures that are proposed to try to create an new entrepreneurial spirit and to develop a smart Wales. I shall not go into the details, but we shall use every effort to make that work. Thirdly, there is the role of public expenditure, which is not mentioned in the document but which I hope will be included in the statement this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main feature of the dependency that has been created since the collapse of our economy in the early part of the century, has been the extent to which public expenditure became so vital to any form of regeneration. We are not willing to tolerate second best in the 21st century. My hon. Friend for Neath (Mr. Hain), the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, met a deputation of parents from Bedlinog who insisted that they would not put up with a second-best school in the form of a refurbished 19th century board school. They wanted their school to move into the 21st century. There must be no more make do and mend in our education infrastructure. We want a 21st century infrastructure for a 21st century economy. Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney constituency is living proof of the significance and importance of productive public expenditure. I am an unapologetic supporter of it, despite its going in and out of fashion from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to recognise that an assembly, a powerhouse and this programme, excellent though they be, will not alone match the needs, requires and challenges that the document presents. I draw two modest conclusions from the history of our experience to bring to my right hon. Friend's attention the part played by consultation. First, the lesson learnt from reading the history of our century and our communities is that we cannot afford unfriendly macro-economic policies. Repeatedly during the past century, policies adopted for different reasons have had the most detrimental effect on our economy. I need not rehearse them, but they start from the gold standard—the last time that the Bank of England was independent—through to the exchange rate mechanism and the present Monetary Policy committee. I hope that sooner or later we can put an end to this bizarre monthly pantomime called the Monetary Policy Committee. Every
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
manufacturing company that I talk to wonders each month whether it will be cast in gloom or sighing with relief. The process began with the Ken Clarke-Eddie George show and has now grown, on a huge new scale. I have read the monetary policy discussions, and it seems to me that all economists carry their own individual ideological baggage. There is no economic philosopher-king and no divine truth resulting from the system, yet that is how the monetary part of our economic policy will be decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friends will have heard that the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee is discussing whether we can have a soft landing or a hard landing and whether we are overheating. Some people wonder whether we have taken off and others say that we are just getting going. Some say we are scarcely warm, and others talk about overheating. That is the sort of nonsense with which we have been afflicted at various times this century. I hope that sooner or later we will draw away from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer talks about long-termism and short-termism; what is more short term than cogitating every month on whether to increase or decrease the Bank rate? That is nonsense. In the 1930s, during the depression and after we left the gold standard, The Bank of England lost control of monetary policy. The bank rate was fixed at 2 per cent., where it stayed for seven years. That sort of longevity may not be possible now, but we can do without the monthly nonsense of the Monetary Policy Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second lesson is an uncomfortable one, which, because it might cause some offence, I preface by saying that in my community and in others, there are wonderful examples of local entrepreneurial achievement, skills and ability. But empirical and historical evidence since the late 19th century shows that the Welsh economy requires inward investment as a major driving force for growth. Entrepreneurship of a kind fostered by the Welsh assembly and the new economic powerhouse will create more jobs than ever before, and that will be a fantastic first this century. Not since the last quarter of the last century, when families owned coal mines, has the Welsh economy grown from locally owned enterprise. Since then, the economy has grown by inward investment. It is one of the great success stories of post-war Wales, especially in the past 25 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one critical observation of the report. I am bewildered by the document's major omission: the function, role and character of a post-devolution, post-assembly Secretary of State for Wales. There is a whole chapter on strengthening institutions, but the future Secretary of State for Wales has disappeared from the document; he is invisible and I do not know why. The great institutional success story of achievements in the Welsh economy in the past 25 years has been the powerful status of the Secretary of State for Wales in a British Cabinet, representing the British Government to the rest of the world. He has the power to speak on behalf of the British Government, as a member of the British Cabinet, to bring inward investment to our economy. We loosen and weaken that function in a post-devolution system at our peril. It is not that I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
believe that a Welsh assembly—an economic powerhouse—cannot do enormous good and develop great talent and skills; but given the awesome challenge of creating 200,000 jobs and the growth needed to achieve that, what is needed is a Secretary of State of the kind and character that we have had in the past 20 years, who will fight for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhynmey and for Wales, as much as ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Ministers will heed my observations and take note of the need to take a wider view even than this interesting, fascinating and important document. As members of the Committee can see all around, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney looks forward. We have removed all the inhibitions to development, such as environmental and communication problems. We are prepared for a 21st century economy. I hope and believe that a Labour Government will deliver it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to focus on two matters—the rural economy and my old hobby-horse, integrated transport and air links. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Some may feel that, after my accident, I should have learned my lesson about flying around Wales. However, I landed on my head and have forgotten everything that I have ever said in previous Committee meetings, so I shall probably repeat myself. I am beginning to feel like some sort of professional lobbyist for agriculture and aviation, but, given the recent revelations in
	<i>The Observer,</i> I shall attempt to lobby Ministers with good ideas and not drinks parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin with the anxiety about the rural economy. We welcome much of the contents of "Path to Prosperity". More than anything, we are pleased that it exists, as for 18 years we felt that Wales was no more than a cash register to be raided when there were problems in other parts of the United Kingdom. I congratulate Ministers on having the foresight to present a vision and strategy with which we broadly agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We especially like the emphasis on education and training and on integrated transport links, to which I shall return a little later. However, because the document implies that economic prosperity has little to do with agriculture, it foreshadows the further neglect of agriculture, which will lead to the abandonment of the physical heartland of Wales. Today's speech by the Secretary of State contained more paragraphs than appear in all the 54 pages of the document. We welcome the Minister's words, but I am worried that they have not been committed to paper to the same extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mid-Wales suffers from the lack of transport links. It has little industry and a failing farming sector. Urban Wales is the focus for rural depopulation. Trickle down from prosperous urban Wales to the depressed countryside will not deliver the goal of economic regeneration in rural areas. The document offers little comfort for rural Wales, either in the short or medium term. It makes it clear that the path to prosperity is the road to an urban, high-tech society, in which manual farm workers do not figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market failures in the countryside have been described well already, so I shall not rehearse those
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
debates. However, we are worried that the Government tend to embrace the buzz words of modernity as if they were the path to a new Britain and sometimes ignore the reality, which is that the problems of traditional Wales are stubborn in their rejection of the quick fix and will not be resolved without significant investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not simply need retraining. The present generation of farmers still want to work on their farms in a largely traditional way. Nor is it likely that substantial growth or wealth generation in urban areas will promote a trickle-down effect that will save the crippled rural communities. Even given the plans for redevelopment and training, however, hon. Members such as my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) and I, who have rural constituences, are a little cynical about whether the document clearly understands the problems of Wales's rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cyber cottages will not suddenly blossom in the countryside, nor will a diet of steak and silicon chips be served in place of more traditional fare. [Interruption.] I thought that that was quite a good joke: I shall fire my speechwriter—or lend him my paraglider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduced agriculture sector will not make a wholesale transition to the high-tech economy. All hon. Members want that transition, but it must take place in the right parts of Wales. The problem with the assumption that a high-tech saviour will come indirectly out of the countryside and prop up the economy is that it risks dividing rural and urban Wales even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word about urban areas. We support many of the points that the document makes. It is right to say that overseas development is important. Like many members of the Committee, I applaud the work of the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. They bring investment from abroad to produce genuinely new jobs, rather than simply shifting jobs around Wales. It is also right to encourage a flexible labour market, which will enable us to take advantage of high-tech opportunities as they arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe will clearly develop more and more into a federation of states within which Wales can be prosperous and extremely effective. Nevertheless, the internal issue that I am attempting to highlight is that, unless we focus on the need for vastly different strategies, we shall create several different Waleses in different states of economic prosperity. That will weaken political structures and economic links and will reinforce cultural divides between urban Wales and the historical heart of Wales—not just mid-Wales, but areas of that nature. We do not want to make it appear as if Cardiff is no nearer the life of much of Wales than is Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have a concern about the assumed east-west divide. My constituency stretches from the English border all the way across to the Welsh coast. Few people would question the fact that we have serious economic difficulties across the whole east-west stretch of Montgomeryshire. The problem cannot be solved by simply designating specific areas and assuming that, in brush-stroke terms, we shall overcome economic difficulties. Should my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Brecon and Radnorshire catch your eye later, Mr. Jones, he will expand on that concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one more brief point about rural Wales before I move on to integrated transport. Rural Wales has to evolve and restructure, but that has to be done sensitively. Nevertheless, we support the rural Wales policy unit. We welcome the fact that it offers an opportunity to understand the issues that I am raising and which Ministers are no doubt eager to handle sensitively. I want, however, to add one word of caution. The point has already been made that, without money and investment, those words will not have much backing—they will be interests without investment. That was exactly the problem with the previous Government—there was little to support the few positive words that we heard. I am surprised to see that Conservatives have sprouted on the Committee during my absence—I shall make a note to go away less often. Nevertheless, I welcome them as would anyone who is committed to proportional representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal briefly with integrated transport. I have often been keen to highlight the issue of creating a Wales in which one can actually get around without having to go to England. It takes longer to get from north Wales to south Wales than it does from Cardiff to London. That is not acceptable. I am extremely encouraged by the Minister's commitment to consider regional air links seriously. I will continue to offer him and the Welsh Office reasoned and written input to encourage them to come up with specific strategies and an investment plan for the airports, which are crying out for investment. In our estimation,£7.5 million to£9 million should furnish Wales with a set of high-quality local airports to link its various areas in a fast and efficient fashion. That will be in the interests of future assembly members and—more to the point in this debate—of those who will seek to invest in areas that are not so accessible from the M4 corridor or the A55.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I support the idea of developing roads, we have to be rational about what we are trying to achieve and ensure that we do not build roads or invest meaninglessly in roads that local people might not want. The road system exists, but it is not of a high enough quality. We have already heard talk of the A470, which provides an opportunity of moving towards an integrated road network without putting too much of a burden on new road building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members should applaud the "Pathway to Prosperity" for being a massive step forward. Some people fear that the pathway will not go through the countryside unless people there are more specifically involved in the debate. Rural Wales cannot wait for the trickle-down effect from manufacturing prosperity. Agriculture deserves more than just two paragraphs in a 54-page document. It certainly deserves the rural policy unit that has been mooted, as long as the unit has the authority to make recommendations that involve investment. A prosperous Wales should have prosperous farmers as well as a prosperous urban community. The countryside that they tend is our countryside, after all, and we depend upon it for our tourism and for many other aspects of Welsh life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Liberal Democrats believe that a successful urban Welsh economy is not the only key to unlocking a successful Wales. It is necessary to create a wealthy urban economy and a successful rural economy. Those are the keys to a prosperous Wales. We hope that the Government will listen to our concerns, and we look forward to action and investment that will reassure all of us that the rural economy—the geographical majority of Wales—has not been abandoned. A new deal for Wales must mean a fair deal both for the countryside and for urban areas. If hon. Members secure that deal, we will help to shape a Wales that is characterised by successful urban areas and by the beautiful countryside that has for so long been the basis of the Welsh economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to be in a semi-circular room once again because that is conducive to consensual debate, which is what we have had so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one point about the arrangements for the Committee. Is it possible to have translation from English into Welsh? That would be an advantage for those of us who are not very good at Welsh but who are learning. Some hon. Members might say that it would be an advantage to translate English into English!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposals in "Pathway to Prosperity", as outlined by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. In recent years, the Welsh economy has suffered more than those of England and Scotland, and well-paid jobs in heavy industry have been lost. The Tories had no strategy for regeneration of the Welsh economy. The Government's creation of a Welsh assembly has given people in Wales an historic opportunity to create a dynamic and productive economy within Europe, based on greater accountability and the rationalisation and focus of our agencies for development. The objectives outlined in the document of higher skill, better wage levels, a better industrial mix and a greater spread of development throughout Wales, are worthy. The analysis coincides with that reached by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs in its first report on economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there are substantial and welcome changes to the Welsh Development Agency, sadly, the opportunity has not been taken to combine the Welsh Office industry department with the new WDA. The industry department within the Welsh Office is responsible for policy advice to Ministers and for processing applications for Government assistance to industry. However, the WDA puts together investment packages and works on investment proposals with the private sector. The Welsh Office industry department has become increasingly involved in the delivery of services, rather than in concerning itself exclusively with regulation, policy formulation and advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee report on economic development proposed an entirely new structure to replace the current Business Connect Wales. That would include the Welsh Office industry department, the business services department of the WDA and the enterprise section of the existing training and enterprise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
councils. The structure would be closely linked to local enterprise agencies. I regret to say that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has so far rejected the idea. As hon. Members will know, the Select Committee is currently hearing evidence in its industry inquiry. It is clear that evidence, especially on experience in Scotland, confirms the Committee's earlier recommendations that industry department inclusion in such a body is the only sensible way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee also proposed the idea of a rural policy unit being part of the enhanced WDA. There was no specific mention of that in the Government of Wales Bill, but we were given assurances by the then Secretary of State and I am delighted to say that it is now policy. I hold the view that such a unit must take over the whole role of the old Development Board for Rural Wales in its application throughout Wales. I welcome the new proposals for the rural partnership for Wales, which I believe will be supported by a new all-Wales policy unit. That is certainly a positive step towards tackling Wales's rural problems and devising proposals to promote the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be presumptuous to take any recommendation about the way in which the assembly should allocate the resources for which it will be responsible, but given the importance of agriculture for a large part of Wales—as other hon. Members have said—the time has come for agriculture to be seen as an industry like any other, and an important one at that. Added impetus for economic development policies to reflect that reality in areas such as marketing and business development is likely to come from the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposals to shift the common agricultural policy in the direction of direct payments to farmers rather than market support for produce and to include certain rural development funding together with agri-environmental services reserves under the agricultural guidelines may well lead to a switch in emphasis towards a more integrated rural policy. If the proposals come to fruition, the argument for greater involvement in agriculture by the enhanced WDA will become still stronger. As I said, the rural partnership is a welcome first step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more than likely that a lack of democratic accountability in decision making on economic development in Wales to date and the emphasis on encouraging inward investment at the expense of supporting indigenous small and medium-size enterprise has contributed to the relative imbalance in investment between east and west Wales and between urban areas and the countryside. It has already been said that there is not simply an east-west split—there are pockets within central and north central Wales where there is a total lack of investment. Conwy and Denbighshire, near my patch, have an appalling record, which is not entirely due to the local authorities—there is a structural problem, which needs to be addressed. Devolution will bring greater transparency to public-sector investment decisions. I, for one, welcome that prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inward investment versus indigenous growth was a theme running through much of the evidence that the Select Committee received. The issue was the proper
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
balance between an industrial development policy and job creation by attracting inward investment and encouraging the growth of existing businesses. We are currently investigating in depth industrial investment in Wales. We will report in the autumn with ideas that we hope will inform the assembly in its deliberation on investment aid. The enhanced WDA and the other measures to improve business support are welcome, but they must be adequately funded and, most importantly, focused on our strengths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the agency is the new WDA, the revitalised Business Connect Wales or a training and enterprise council, everyone involved should be able to direct a business person or someone with an investment query—be it about indigenous investment or an incoming development—to the organisation that can help. That means that each organisation must know what every other organisation can offer. If that is not the case, we will miss a real opportunity to help to create the prosperity at which the document is aimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is a worthy one. Certain of its proposals must not be missed. I believe that the ability of every organisation to know what every other organisation does in this area is the most important feature. We have seen that in evidence from Scotland, Ireland and Catalonia. What is vital is not just how an organisation is drawn up or how its functions are delivered, but that every organisation knows what those functions are and is able to help. It is the old story of the one-stop shop. That is a glib statement, but this is our most important opportunity for prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Much has been said about the changing face of Wales, which is right in such an economic debate. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney spoke about the transformation and the change, from the old industries in coal and steel to the new and smaller industries that are now to be found throughout Wales. However, much more must be done to bolster our small and medium-sized enterprises. Those changes did not start in 1979, but the necessary changes that have taken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
place have helped to deliver to Wales low inflation and the lowest continuous inflation for 50 years, low unemployment, low income tax, high inward investment, high productivity and output, competitive interests rates and the chance for industry to make longterm plans. The past 14 months have put all those gains in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much, perhaps too much, has been placed on the shoulders of the new assembly. We wish the assembly a good wind when it starts next year and I hope and trust that it will be a success. However, we must concede that it has the lukewarm support of the Welsh people, and even that may dissipate in the light of the six-figure sum that is being spent on promoting the elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government set enormous store by PR—I do not mean proportional representation, but public relations in the packaging of their policies. In the foreword to "Pathway to Prosperity", the Secretary of State states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our vision is of a new Wales striving to build a high quality economy in a New Britain as part of a new Europe. This means good skills for everyone delivered through the Government's New Deal and other innovative programmes such as Lifelong Learning. It means high quality telecommunications and transport links. It means investment in new technology industries and services."</p></blockquote>
If ever a word has been flogged to death, it is the word "new" in that foreword. There is also mention of the "New Economic Agenda", the "New Agenda", a "new reality" and the "new Economic Powerhouse". It would greatly assist the economic regeneration of Wales if we had a new Secretary of State for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can accept only that the God-given right for the Labour party to form the largest, if not the controlling, group in the Welsh assembly, is disappearing day by day, as we learn more about how the Government operate—I shall say more about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the main thrust of today's debate. Since 1983, there have been 1,700 inward-investment projects, with nearly £11 billion coming into Wales. That has created, or safeguarded, 160,000 jobs. Manufacturing is vital to Wales and inward investment accounts for almost a third of all manufacturing employment. The announcement of the £1.7 billion investment in LG, which will create 6,100 jobs, is welcome. An important multiplier must also be considered. A report from the Welsh Economic Review by Stephen Hill and Annette Roberts, entitled "Understanding the Welsh Economy" refers to the effect of all those extra jobs. It subdivides them between LG Electronics and LG Semicon and shows that well over 14,000 jobs will be created because of the multiplier effect. That ripple effect is of enormous importance in other sections of the economy, such as agriculture, energy, construction, distribution and transport. We can look forward to many more jobs being created as a result of the fact that LG will be based in Newport, and we want the success in Newport to be replicated time and again throughout Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other inward investment success stories, including Ford at Bridgend, Newport Wafer and Fab at Dyffryn and Sony at Pencoed and Bridgend. Hundreds of millions of pounds worth of inward investment has created and safeguarded hundreds and thousands of jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WDA's total budget for 1996-97 was £157 million. In that year, 483 inward-investment projects from overseas created 10,000 jobs directly and 36,000 elsewhere in the economy. I stress the importance of manufacturing when I say that 228,000 Welsh people worked in manufacturing in 1995, which was an increase of 15 pr cent. over the previous 10 years. Output also increased by 20 per cent. and productivity grew faster in Wales than in other parts of the United Kingdom. Unemployment was cut by half since its 1992 peak to a figure that was closer to the United Kingdom average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as has been said time and again, there are pockets of high unemployment. In Merthyr, the unemployment rate is twice that of areas with the lowest unemployment rates, which is about 3 per cent. We must be cautious when talking about employment increasing throughout Wales when there are areas of serious deprivation and high levels of unemployment. We must look further than the A55 and the M4 for creating extra employment. I was delighted to hear on the news that the old Laura Ashley factory in Machynlleth is re-opening today, employing many of its former employees. We all welcome the fact that that unit is re-opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the whole of Wales to share in that prosperity. We have again spoken of the north-south divide being replaced by an east-west divide—we have experienced a lot of that. We are sandwiched between Ireland—it receives large sums of money from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
European Union and has used much of it to target new technologies and the computer industry—and, on the right-hand side, by England and the investment that has occurred there. We want to ensure that Wales shares in that prosperity and is not continually squeezed between those two other parts of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to speak briefly about the introduction of regional development agencies. The Welsh Development Agency has been a tremendous success story, but I want the Minister to tell us what action will be taken to ensure that Wales continues to attract the levels of inward investment that we have enjoyed during recent years. When the RDAs are introduced, with the signing of the concordats about which we have heard so much recently, will Wales be disadvantaged? Will the jobs that we have been previously used to attracting dry up and go elsewhere in the United Kingdom, to parts where unemployment may be much lower than it is throughout Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a slowdown in economies in other parts of the world—in Japan and other parts of Asia. Indeed, today, the Japanese premier has resigned and much of the blame for that has been placed on the fact that the Japanese economy has entered recession. So, it will be even harder to compete for inward investment in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing is in recession—it has been declining for two continuous quarters—which will hit Wales hard, because of our reliance on manufacturing industry. Dun and Bradstreet today announced that lack of confidence has been spreading from manufacturing to other sections of the economy. We are witnessing something called stagflation: inflation in a stagnating economy. Even in the service sector, some areas are in decline, but wages are continuing to increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The June survey conducted by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply found that growth in the service sector had shrunk to its lowest level for two years. The institute said that the strong pound and the high level of interest rates were behind the decline in new business. The pound is strong, and the Government must concede that it is not merely the strength of the pound but the length of time for which it has been strong that is damaging British business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have abdicated their control of interest rates to the Monetary Policy Committee, which the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney mentioned and which is nothing more than a quango under Eddie George. The hon. Gentleman talked about the Ken and Eddie show. That has now been replaced by the Eddie show. We know that the Government are keen to give up the pound to join the euro as quickly as possible. I have heard of irresponsible government before, but never before have I seen a Government attempting not to be responsible for the major decisions that impact on this country. They will be held responsible by the people of this country for the economic decisions that are rightly theirs to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I broadly welcome a project that the Minister announced recently: the Wales future skills needs project. It involves 5,000 companies and 6,000 individuals; I understand that they will be interviewed by MORI over several months to establish a

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A six-figure sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least we will see something from that venture; I hear the Minister putting a cost to it from a sedentary position; it is right that we know that cost, so that we can tell if we are getting value for money. I broadly welcome the concept of providing information to help schools, colleges and careers services with training for the future in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also assume that much of the work to be done will dovetail with the work started under the regional technology plan, under which a major review of the innovation support infrastructure in Wales was carried out. One alarming result of that review, which is clearly stated in "Pathway to Prosperity", is that Wales lags behind the rest of Europe in research and development. "Lag" is in fact a generous term, because we are well behind in research and development. I fully understand that many businesses that have factories and depots here may have their headquarters sited outside Wales and that research and development may be carried out elsewhere. However, it is extremely worrying that research and development in Wales is 1.1 per cent. of GDP. The founder of Sony Morita said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If we don't make our products obsolete, our competitors will."</p></blockquote>
The Institute for Welsh Affairs stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If Wales is to achieve the prosperity target for the year 2010, it is essential that an effective framework for profitable, commercial exploitation of research and development and new technology is created to maximise the effectiveness of Government and private funding."</p></blockquote>
Taking on board why we believe research and development is so low in Wales, we must rise to the challenge and look to ways of ensuring more research and development so that many more high value-added jobs are created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must know what action the Government will be taking to attract high-value jobs into Wales. Will Government research facilities be sited in Wales, for example? What encouragement can be given to close the equity gap that deters many firms from recommitting their profits or funds into research and development? What educational training will be given to smaller and medium-sized businesses, specifically to raise awareness of research and development? I stress the point that I made last Wednesday in our debate on the deprived economic areas of Wales about the Federation of Small Businesses, which is calling for an investment bank. Perhaps some of the resources from such an institution could be directed towards research and development for smaller businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What impact will the strategic defence review have on the economy of Wales? We are aware of the national impact of losing 36 Tornados, of the number of those in the Territorial Army being reduced from 59,000 to 40,000, of the cuts in heavy lift aircraft and so on. There will be a cut of £685 million in the defence budget. All the spinning in the world will not hide the fact that Wales considers the defence budget important. We want to know the impact of such cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
The assembly will not have tax-raising powers and, being as generous as we would like to be, I suspect that the people of Wales would vote against it having such powers. We must receive guarantees from the Government about one of the fears of Welsh industry—it wants there to be an eye to long-term planning and to know what costs it will face in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like some guarantees from the Minister about two threats that might occur at the same time, the first of which relates to the top slicing of some of the budget that will be given to the assembly, which will mean that local authorities will have to look to businesses and the domestic council tax payer to make up some of the shortfall. At the same time, the uniform business rates will be reformed so that more power may be given to local authorities to raise more of their funds by raising the taxes on businesses in their areas. That would be a double whammy for businesses in Wales. 
	<i>The Western Mail</i> reported the mayor of Cardigan as saying that businesses in Cardigan are paying higher rates than some businesses in London. If local authorities were given the power to attack local businesses, because of the shortfall in money that they receive from central Government, that could be extremely damaging for reinvestment in jobs and the increase and improvement in job prospects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the previous Tory Administration introduced uniform business rates throughout the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to confirm that. When I was a West Glamorgan county councillor, I argued for changes to be made to take control away from some local authorities. When local business people were finding trading difficult they pleaded with the council not to increase the business rate into double digits. The consultation process that took place between the local authorities and businesses seemed to be mere window dressing—a facade—because at the end of that period up went the local business rate and business suffered as a result. At least there is now some stability and predictability for local business. In any changes that take place, we want guarantees for small businesses in particular that they will not be clobbered by changes in the UBR.

Tourism is extremely important to Wales. There has been a decline in the number of tourists visiting Wales this year, which is extremely worrying. It is not just the weather; other factors also have an effect. A lively debate is taking place in the letters columns of newspapers. Business people want the Wales tourist board to do more to attract more tourist to Wales. What do the Government believe they could do to attract more tourists—and higher—spending tourists—to assist jobs in the tourist industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something has already been said about the new deal, which will be important for the job prospects of many people in Wales who have been unemployed for a long time. I should like to know about the geographical spread of the new deal in Wales, to ensure that it benefits people from all sections and that pockets do not escape the help that they could receive from it.

How is the Welsh Office budgeting to provide for the impact of the minimum wage in Wales? Many more poorly paid jobs are in the tourist industry. It is generally believed that the introduction of the minimum wage will affect jobs—that they will be lost—which will affect unemployment in Wales and the new deal budget. What budgetary preparations has the Under-Secretary made to ensure that we shall be able to contend with the impact of the minimum wage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. How Edwards 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the hon. Gentleman of the criticism that was made against the Equal Pay Act 1970—that it would have an impact on jobs for women? Does he recall the evidence that suggests that women's employment increased following the Equal Pay Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take some of my evidence from the Deputy Prime Minister, who said that there would be a jobs shake-out with the introduction of a minimum wage. The CBI and the Institute of Directors agree. We do not yet know the extent of that jobs shake-out. We must ensure that the new deal has a sufficient budget to contend with it. I understand that the Deputy Prime Minister announced today that money will be made available to former coal-mining areas. I hope that some of that money finds its way to Wales to ensure that places such as Merthyr, which relied so heavily on the mining industry in the past, receive their fair share, to provide new hope for areas that have declined because of a shift in emphasis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not talked to young people, who find the appalling wages offered in some cases—often in the caring professions—demeaning, demotivating and utterly dispiriting. The minimum wage—a floor, at least, to wages—is an important social as well as economic instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that for many people a low wage would be better than no wage. It is at least a foothold into better paid employment later on. I cannot think of anything that would be more dispiriting than to have no job—no incentive even to get out of bed in the mornings for many people. I emphasise that we must ensure that if new funds are being made available for areas that relied on old industries such as coal mining, Wales must receive its fair share of that money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To support my hon. Friend's argument and to remove ourselves from the emotion of the minimum wage, I must point out that if a business cannot afford to pay the minimum wage, sadly, it will not employ young people. In the latest quarterly economic bulletin by Liverpool Macro Economic Research Ltd, it is predicted that the White Paper "Fairness at Work" and the minimum wage will together prove such a threat to Britain's labour market flexibility that employment will increase to between 3 million and 4 million and cost the economy 3 per cent. in output by 2002.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is enough evidence to show that the introduction of the minimum wage will have an impact. I want to talk about a profession in which people dream of a minimum wage—farming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the hon. Gentleman wants to say; let me just finish my point. Many farmers' incomes have gone down to rock bottom, irrespective of any minimum wage. Some agricultural incomes have declined by 89 per cent. I do not think that any other professional in the United Kingdom, never mind Wales, has suffered such deep cuts. The Committee must know that is is not just farmers who are affected. There is a ripple effect in rural areas. Farmers are unable to invest in new tractors or plant, or in employing people. Many people have to get a second job just to keep a farm going and in the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Pathway to Prosperity" was rather thin on farming and agriculture. Organic farming may be important and may provide some farmers with the opportunity for extra value added on their produce. However, that will not be the answer for the vast majority of farmers, who want more from the Government and who are in weekly contact with their banks just to keep their farms going. If they were to wave "Pathway to Prosperity" in front of their bank managers and say, "It's okay; organic farming is the answer", the bank managers would laugh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with some of what the hon. Gentleman said about farming. However, while he argued against the minimum wage, the industry that he spoke of does, effectively, have a minimum wage. How does he square that contradiction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that maintaining that level does not help people who work in agriculture. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] No, it does not help at all. A minimum wage provides no security of income for fanners. Many of the relevant enterprises are small businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman must be patient for a second longer. As he will know from his constituency, many farms are run by families. They get the family to help keep the farm going, by paying them nothing. A wife will help and will not take a wage. The owner may well have to get a second job. None of what is being suggested will help them. They are looking to the Government for extra help, but they have time and again received a kick in the teeth instead of help with long-term planning to keep farms going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport is also mentioned in "Pathway to Prosperity". We expect a White Paper to be issued shortly about transport infrastructure and policy, to which there will be a Welsh dimension. Will the Welsh dimension be dealt with simultaneously with the publication of the White Paper, or with the leak of that White Paper? Alternatively, will we have to wait weeks or months? It is vital to get transport policies right and to undertake long-term planning, because businesses rely on the Government's policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

After "Pathway to Prosperity", what will the business people of Wales think of the Government? What hope for the future will they have when they see that the party of Wales, and of Britain, has given up socialism and replaced it with cronyism? It has ditched its principles but would die in a ditch to protect the shady, seedy dealings of its burgeoning empire of advisers and friends. "Things can only get better"—well, they certainly did for the Labour new boys. Insider lobbying led to £250-an-hour chats around the Downing street dining table. It is a culture which has minimised the importance of the Cabinet and Ministers and put on a pedestal the inner sanctum, the people who can make things happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must be a million miles away from what Wales was promised in 1997 and from the lives of the ordinary people of Wales who are wrestling with higher mortgage rates, reeling from higher interest rates and straining under the extra taxes heaped on them by the Government since 1 May. They can only look on the daily revelations of how government works under new Labour and wonder whether there is the slightest hope that while the special advisers rub shoulders with their old friends at lobby soirees, between the nods and the winks and the sipping of champagne a thought might be spared as to why the Government were elected in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party appears to love a party, and careless talk costs for whoever is prepared to pay. The party must now be over. It will be over for the Labour party. The cronyism which has corroded this Government must end and a fresh start must be made. The assembly must not be allowed to be tainted by the cash-for-access scandal. A contract for Wales must put the people, not the politicians, of Wales first. We must have a clear and transparent code of conduct established right at the very beginning and signed up to by all the members of the assembly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather surprisingly, in view of the previous speech, I want to direct my remarks to the subject on the Order Paper today. I want in particular to deal with some of the interesting issues that have been raised in respect of the east-west prosperity gap and what we can do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on all of us to say how very warmly we welcome the great step forward that has been made in getting the European Commission to accept, at least at a statistical level, although not yet at the policy level, the case for objective 1 status. We are halfway there. The extra potential regional development assistance that will arise because the Welsh Office has managed to get the statistical side of the case accepted is very important. The whole of west Wales, together with the industrial valley of south-east Wales, can have a reasonable prospect—at least a 75 per cent. chance—of having objective 1 status some time next year. For the following seven or eight years, part of the major job of the assembly will be to provide the matching funds that will go with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statistical case is stage one. Getting the policy accepted in Europe and by the UK Government is stage two. The provision of the matching funds will be stage three, as the right hon. Member for Caernarfon said earlier. That stage will not be an easy one; it will be a major challenge, but it represents a huge opportunity to spread prosperity around Wales. It is important for all of us to concentrate on how to achieve an even spread of prosperity. That is a difficult matter, as is made clear by the figures in "Pathway to Prosperity".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will shed some light on several matters relating to the spread of prosperity in Wales. The first is the direction of inward investment. For some 30 to 40 years, a considerable effort has been made to direct investment to the west and to the valleys and that has been successful to some extent. However, it does not seen to have had much impact on the amount of GDP per head—the prosperity level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 23 of the report lists some astonishing statistics. The last two columns of the table on that page show the recipients of regional selective assistance offers, and the two counties that dominate are Mid Glamorgan and Gwent. They received 32 per cent. and 31 per cent. respectively of all regional selective assistance during the 10 years from April 1988 to March 1998. Mid Glamorgan received £247 million, and Gwent received £242 million, which means that 63 per cent. of the total amount of regional selective assistance went to about 39 per cent. or the population of Wales. Those regions are the powerhouses of new industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, at GDP level that assistance does not seem to have done Mid Glamorgan much good, as GDP in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
that area is only 80 per cent. per head. Gwent seems to have benefited from the major new investment, as it has 104 per cent. of GDP per head of the Welsh average. However, at 20 per cent. below that figure, Mid Glamorgan is as far behind the Welsh average as Wales is behind the European average. We need to discover the reason for that gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might be able to account for the gap by the fact that many professional people who work in, or serve the population of, Mid Glamorgan live in Powys of South Glamorgan. I believe that a member of the Committee quoted from an academic report on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might live in Dinas Powys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. There are probably a few such people. I know at least one. That fact might explain the differences in the GDP figures. Such differences do not always show up because it is difficult to draw the line between Mid Glamorgan and South Glamorgan. Many of us remember the old arguments in the early 1970s about whether Mid Glamorgan and South Glamorgan should be separate counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document certainly shows us that regional selective assistance was primarily allocated to Mid Glamorgan and Gwent; Clwyd was third; and South Glamorgan and West Glamorgan were fourth and fifth, respectively, with allocations of £62 million and £59 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notably, South Glamorgan received a quarter of the amount allocated to Mid Glamorgan, but its GDP—135 per cent. of the Welsh average—was some 50 to 60 per cent. higher than that of Mid Glamorgan, which has a GDP of 80 per cent. of the average. If new jobs are coming into Mid Glamorgan at the regional selective assistance level, why is there such a large gap in the GDP per head figures? It means either that the separate figures are a nonsense and that we should have only one figure for South Glamorgan and Mid Glamorgan, or that there is some confusion about the way that prosperity flows—or, in this case, fails to flow—from new industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, my hon. Friend makes an interesting point. However, if he reads paragraph 3.19 on page 12, he will find that wages in foreign-owned companies in Mid Glamorgan are on average 10 per cent. more than in domestically owned companies. The explanation for the gap that he referred to lies in the fact that there has been a massive collapse in jobs in those areas and inward investment has not been able to fill the hole that was left. For example, jobs in retailing were often the only alternative to the well-paid jobs that were lost in Taff Merthyr or in deep navigation. It is for that reason, as much as for those referred to by my hon. Friend, that we have the gap to which he has drawn our attention. In fact, inward investment often leads wages and earnings in many of our communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept my hon. Friend's point. Jobs have been lost in the traditional staple industries while jobs have been created in new industries as a result of inward investment or local growth. The figures that I quoted from the table on the use of regional selective assistance related to inward
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
investment and to local firms. However, the GDP per head net figure is based on the new jobs created minus the old ones lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference in GDP per head is also related to the symbiotic relationship between Mid and South Glamorgan that has existed for the past 250 years. One cannot argue that Mid Glamorgan would benefit enormously from choking off the inward investment tap for South Glamorgan. The tap is fairly fully on in Mid Glamorgan and any diversion of new jobs into the valleys as a result of shutting it off—as we did in the 10 years from 1964 to 1974 when I first became involved in the subject—might not be of great benefit to Mid Glamorgan or Gwent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend has expertise in this area and I am interested in his analogy between South and Mid Glamorgan. Can that analogy not be applied to Wales as a whole? Although it is right to talk about redistributing wealth to the rest of Wales—in particular the west and the valleys—is there not a danger of so gearing our inward investment strategy that we deter people from coming to Wales at all? That would not be in the interests of anyone in Wales. Does my hon. Friend agree that a balance should be struck?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it another way? We are in danger of speaking within what one might call a Welsh box and of using a zero sum for the fixed total of jobs in Wales. That assumes that if more jobs go to one area, fewer will automatically go to another. I do not think that that is a constructive way of approaching the problem. In the past 10 or 15 years, the Republic of Ireland has managed to avoid doing that, and the document is not fully up to scratch with developments there. It has managed to break out of its traditional overdependence on agriculture and on local small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any changes that we make to increase the spread of prosperity must not be based on the assumption that a negative figure in one area will lead to a positive figure in another. When I was in local government and a civil servant in the Welsh Office and the Department of Trade and Industry between 1964 and 1974, Cardiff and Newport were not eligible for regional assistance. That probably damaged Wales far more than it benefited the areas further west. Industries that might have been attracted to Cardiff or Newport between 1964 and 1974 went to Newcastle or Glasgow because, like Cardiff and Newport, they had good communications and large labour forces. However, those features were not found elsewhere in Wales. Therefore, Wales lost industries to other parts of the United Kingdom. Although we want to spread prosperity, we should bear in mind the table on page 23 of the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sectoral approach represents the biggest difference between the Republic of Ireland and Wales. As paragraph 5.28 of the document states, we will not attempt a sectoral approach. We will not attempt to predict the parts of industry that will expand the most and that could suit us best by closing the prosperity gap between Wales and the rest of the UK and between Wales and the European average.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Ireland has gone for the sectoral approach, which has done the trick for that country. It has overtaken Wales in GDP per head in the past 20 years and has done so largely by adopting a sectoral approach. Rejecting that approach in paragraph 5.28 therefore requires strong justification. The sectoral approach has worked for one of our competitors by attracting inward investment and by creating indigenous jobs. Why are we rejecting that approach, when we were sure that we could do the same trick as the Republic of Ireland? We must catch up with that country. By adopting such an approach, the Republic of Ireland has been successful in picking winners. It has decided which sectors of the economy will grow fastest, which economic sectors are best suited to an economy on Europe's western periphery, and which sectors will be well-paid, thus solving the low pay gap alluded to by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like to interrupt the flow of my hon. Friend's interesting speech. However, when I was in Ireland as a member of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, the evidence that we gathered did not quite show a sectoral approach. The Irish were playing to their strengths, as I mentioned earlier. They focused on what they felt that they did best. They did not concentrate on one sector, such as electrical engineering, microchips or information technology. They felt that they should put all their efforts into a broad range of investment, both inward and indigenous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not cross swords with the Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, as I was not on that visit to Ireland. However, I understand that in Ireland there is a concentration on areas such as software, health care and related industries. To some extent, there has been an attempt to discover which well paid and high valued-added industries are suitable for Ireland. Those industries would not be suitable for Wales. Although we are on the western periphery of the European Community, we are not as far west as the Republic of Ireland. The Irish wanted to close the pay gap and the research and development gap. That approach would not work in Wales, but why has it been rejected so speedily in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objective 1 status will give Wales the potential to do many things, such as unifying vocational and higher education. That will enable us to produce people with the right type of diplomas, vocational qualifications and degrees to work in the growth sectors that will be generated by inward investment or by the encouragement of indigenous industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on public expenditure relativities, I am inclined to agree with critics from Swansea, the valleys and north and west Wales who say that Cardiff has received too much public expenditure. Those of us connected with Cardiff have not asked for that expenditure—in general, it has been dumped on us—but, I am afraid that we are blamed for it. "Look at Cardiff," people say. "It gets so much money from different sources." On behalf of the citizens of Cardiff, I reply, "We never asked for the Cardiff bay barrage. We never asked—if lottery expenditure is included—"for
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
the millennium stadium." Unfortunately, such cuckoos in the nest are dumped on us and used against us. People say, "Lucky old Cardiff, receiving that money yet again. Why shouldn't it be spent elsewhere?" That would be fair enough if the expenditure had been chosen locally, but it was not. As with the barrage, the expenditure was dumped on us by the previous Tory Government, when we would have been much happier if it had been spent on what the hon. Member for Ribble Valley calls frontline services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks about how much money is being spent on an education information programme or the Welsh assembly. He talks about £200 million being spent on the Cardiff bay barrage rather than on frontline services. He asks how many extra nurses and teachers could be employed if the funds were not spent elsewhere. Virtually everyone in Wales could have had a nurse to themselves if the money had not been spent on the Cardiff bay barrage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me be clear about what the hon. Gentleman is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In public expenditure terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Public expenditure of benefit to the community and on which the community has been consulted is what we all want, but we did not get that in Cardiff. Moreover, Cardiff's extra expenditure was quoted against us in connection with the so-called prosperity gap. Cardiff's public expenditure has helped to employ some building workers, but very few relative to the total amount of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much depends on the specific project. Pouring concrete in huge masonry walls to close off the Taff and the Ely will not create the same number of jobs as renovating houses. Housing renovation grants will bring 10 times more bang for the bucks—in terms of the employment of building workers—on the same expenditure. The expenditure has not really created prosperity in Cardiff but it may appear that it has in tables that set out the total expenditure—including lottery expenditure—invested in Cardiff or south Glamorgan. When such tables are considered in close association with tables on the GDP per head gap, they are seen to be connected. However, that can be misleading and does not provide the solution to the problem of spreading prosperity around Wales, which is much more related to transport infrastructure. That should have been studied more closely in the document. We need to ensure that no areas of Wales are believed by industrialists—rightly or wrongly—to be unreachable. Wales itself is hard enough to reach, but we cannot allow industrialists to gain the impression that certain areas of Wales can be reached only on foot and are effectively off the communications map—too remote, too hard to get to and too unsuitable for modern business development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my pleas today. I would like answers to questions about the figures, the sectoral approach and

	<i>(Translation)</i>: I welcome the document. The way to prosperity today leads to Merthyr Tydfil, the cradle of the industrial revolution. As a north man myself, I pay tribute to the people of Merthyr Tydfil—a town with such a rich history in the politics and economy of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is high time that we had an economic strategy in Wales. Under the previous Government, there was no such thing as an economic strategy for Wales and I am pleased that the gap is now being filled so well by the Welsh Office. I pay tribute to the excellent work done by my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Welsh Office in the past few months. I refer especially to the Under-Secretaries, my hon. Friends the Members for Neath (Mr. Hain) and for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), and to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who have all done so much hard work recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that with the new assembly we are on the threshold of a new period in our history. This is the first time we have had an elected body for the whole of Wales. I sincerely hope that it will be able to respond to the economic requirements of Wales. Under the old system, the lack of sufficient democratic control over the Welsh Development Agency led to deficiencies in our economy. It led to unbalanced development geographically and, generally, in economic terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the gap between east and west. When this arose I suggested that one reason was that there was not enough answerability in a sense, and the old development agency tended to concentrate on the large developments in the north and south-east at the expense of the western areas—from Denbigh onwards to Conwy, as well as the industrial valleys. Creating policy in an undemocratic way led to over-emphasis on internal investment at the expense of local businesses. It is high time that we corrected that. I look forward to the new policies in the document becoming effective under the new national assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate briefly on some of the important aspects that are emphasised in the document. First, there is a need for economic stability—a macro economy—in Wales. I welcome the Government's emphasis on longterm investment and on keeping down inflation. That should bring the stability that we lacked during the previous 18 years. Secondly, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney about the history of this area. The Government must, of course, direct internal investment to areas such as this—the industrial valleys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->

	<i>(Translation)</i>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but much greater public expenditure will be needed. Where will it come from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The emphasis of which I spoke came this morning from my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. He stressed that we should not forget the Government's important role in attracting internal investment. The Government have an important role, but there have been weaknesses in
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
recent years because of insufficient support for local businesses, which are important in that they create employment for our young people, and wealth. Much work has already been done. Interestingly, it is argued that the role of small and medium-sized businesses is better played in Wales than in England. The importance of smaller businesses to our economy is clear. I welcome the work in this respect, especially by the University of Cardiff. Professor Kevin Morgan and Mr. Brian Morgan in particular are in the forefront of putting the arguments for Wales. People see value in a regional platform and potential in creating new economic and regional policies, and we should not ignore them. That is one of the greatest strengths of the proposed decentralised electoral system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the importance of investment in education. Everyone must have the proper skills, which is why I stress the importance of continuous, lifelong learning. Some hon. Members have already referred to better transport; better telecommunications are also needed. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West that we must make the areas in the west far more attractive to investors. There is room, too, to promote the aviation industry. I welcome the work that the Welsh Office has already done in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of investment in industries and new technologies, I agree with the criticism of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West that the document does not emphasise the sectoral aspect. We can learn from the experience of Ireland and Scotland. Reference has already been made to the fact that the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs has done much research on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main public expenditure in Wales mentioned in the Budget, which will be decentralised to the assembly, will be on health, primarily, and education. There is a comparatively moderate sum for economic development. As the assembly will have to prove its own success in economic terms, more than anything else, there is a danger, but also a potential, for members of the assembly to want to interfere in the way in which education is provided. I agree that there is a need to link vocational and academic education. I welcome the unification that the Government have proposed in that respect, although there is more work to be done. There is value in the idea of a Welsh baccalaureate, but we must tread carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much talk of taking one step at a time in respect of a tertiary system for the whole of Wales. It is already happening in parts of Wales, and it is justified on the basis that it prevents the wasteful competition in further education. Some of my constituents will be very concerned if we move too quickly towards a tertiary system of education, which has important implications, especially in rural areas—the subject has been mentioned in the past week in connection with a school in Ruthin, in my constituency. Some hon. Members, who represent constituencies in areas similar to mine, would agreed with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our eagerness to redistribute wealth within Wales, we should not forget that Wales is considered as a peripheral area. No one wants regional economic policies to be pitched in such a way that internal investors will not be prepared to come to Wales. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
has been a good level of success in the east and the south-east, and as the representative of a western area I should like to see that spread further. I agree with members of the Committee who have said that a redistribution of wealth is necessary. Public transport is an important factor in that. I congratulate my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Welsh Office on their excellent work in producing the document during this exciting time for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>(Translation)</i>
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely glad to be in Merthyr Tydfil for this debate. I lived here for three years before being elected to Parliament, and was given a warm welcome in the town: I still have some friends here. I was a member of the old borough council for two years, and i still have the bruises from the political lessons that I received from Bryn Watkins, Tal John and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that time I was head of the finance department at Hoover, which is 50 years old this year. The company employed 5,000 people then, and it intended to employ up to 8,000. The number of employees has now dwindled to fewer than 1,000, the company's headquarters having moved from London to Merthyr. That reflects the changes that have occurred over the period. The hon. Member for Cardiff, West mentioned the jobs that have come to various parts of Wales. From 1986 to 1996 the M4 corridor and the eastern side of the A55 enjoyed an increase of 9,600 production jobs, but over the same period the western side of Wales and the valleys experienced a decrease of 9,000 jobs. That is the danger—winning in some areas and losing in others. A more balanced programme is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was on the council there were 24 committees, of which I was on 22. The two that I was not on were industrial development and finance: the only two that I knew something about. That was the type of experience that I had in the valleys. There is a lot in common between my experiences in Merthyr in the coalmining areas and my experiences in the quarry areas in terms of the old industrial structure falling down and the old diseases striking so many people. The latter are highlighted by the demographic map. Merthyr was the birthplace of the industrial revolution. It had a population of 20,000 when, Cardiff was a village of only 1,000 people. There is now a campaign to get Dic Penderyn a pardon for being unjustly hanged during a period of industrial unrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the subject of today's debate. I had an opportunity to follow the topic last Wednesday in Parliament, but I would like to put a different emphasis on it today. The Committee meets on a day when industry warns us that we are moving into a depression, and we must bear that in mind when we discuss policies. Last Wednesday I was criticised by the Under-Secretary of State for Wales for not giving all the answers. I kindly suggest that that is the Government's
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
job. Their analysis has raised the questions: perhaps I shall hear the answers when today's debate is wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the document's honesty. It is in total contrast to "Wales: The Way Ahead", published in 1967, which said that only 15,000 new jobs were needed when it was clear that thousands of jobs were being lost in the coal industry and that a high level of unemployment was being created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With due respect, we look forward to the Government explaining what exactly are the answers to the industry requirements of Wales. So far the Government have not answered the necessary detailed questions. They have not set out a programme for providing 250,000 new jobs—if indeed that is their goal. Nor have the Government set out a programme for increasing the GDP per head by 43 per cent., the target to which the document refers. They have not said which geographical area is in greatest need, but that is the area into which the jobs must be introduced. The hon. Member for Cardiff, West raised the sectoral point. Certainly, places such as Galway in Ireland have taken advantage of that by designing education to suit various sectors of the economy so as to attract work and get the necessary skills into the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the cost of improving the essential services mentioned in the document? More important, where will that money come from? Obviously, the Green Paper before the Committee does not have the status of a White Paper and so does not contain a detailed statement of how the targets will be set and achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to see the Secretary of State back in his place. I asked him about objective 1 money for Wales. We warmly welcome the fact that Eurostat has accepted that that money should be available. It is a key step in the right direction—as the hon. Member for Cardiff, West said, it is the first of the two or three such steps that are needed. However, that money will reach west Wales and the industrial valleys, including Merthyr Tydfil, only if the European Union is convinced that it will make a difference in raising the GDP per head. That is the main consideration for money designated for the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such resources must be additional and over and above what is being spent already. There is no point in the Treasury pocketing one tranche of money from Europe simply because there is money in Wales already. That would make no difference to the level of expenditure required to change the prospects for GDP in the west of Wales. The aim is to create additional developments. The word "additionality" is the basis of this vision of Europe. To get the money for Wales, the Government must persuade Brussels that it will be additional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Fontainebleau agreement is not much help. When this Welsh Grand Committee was held in Carmarthen, hon. Members heard how Fontainebleau was less than helpful to the agriculture industry: money from Brussels to help agriculture was offset by the loss of money from other sources. For every £100 million of objective 1 money that Wales could get from Europe to help its economy, the Treasury would lose £71 million. While such regulations remain in place, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
Government are more or less encouraged not to maximise the money available from Europe. We have heard how Ireland has not taken full advantage of the money that is available. If the regulations under which we must work have the effect that I have described, there is a great danger that the same could happen in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must cut free from expenditure programmes set by the Tory Government. We look forward to tomorrow's statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Will the objective 1 money, and the money necessary to balance it, be available? We hope that the Welsh Office will note how Ireland has adapted its education system to help the economy, attract investment and encourage young people to set up new ventures and enterprises. We welcome the fact that the Government are looking at Ireland to see what lessons can be learnt from that direction. We need to improve our education system, the fibre-optic network, the environment, public transport and the health service. All of those are crying out for new expenditure, which means higher expenditure than now. The Government must change their attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>(Translation)</i>: In the context of the right hon. Gentleman's opinion that a substantial increase in public expenditure is needed, will he throw some light on what such an increase would mean for levels of income tax? Will he bear in mind that his electors, who, like mine, include people in small businesses and rural farmers, would be anxious if income tax were increased?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of our farmers would be prepared to pay if they could pay income tax at all. Some of them are on family benefits and are at too low a level to do so. Additional public expenditure must mean higher income. I would expect and accept another 2p on income tax, especially at the higher level, and the removal of the maximum on national insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must spend more wisely the money that we have already. For example, money should not be spent on Trident. Far more cuts could be made, and the money could be spent on what people need. More could be spent on education, and not on the dome and the foolish expenditure that such ventures involve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another central question: the level of the pound, and its undermining of our production and agriculture. The too-high level affects the value of the pound against the green pound. Farmers in west Clwyd and elsewhere have far too little support and subsidy. If the Government were really concerned, we would see a different policy from that of keeping the pound so high. Interest rates became unreasonably high after the Government yielded to the Bank of England and gave it complete control. I am glad to see the economy being damped by increasing rates, but it would help if interest rates were not the only weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Secretary of State to make a statement on the industrial development map. I understand that the new one is about to come out. I should like to see how that is proceeding. We need to consider how the WDA will put more emphasis on indigenous businesses, on using more indigenous raw materials and on how to give efficient priority to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
western areas and the valleys. That is always mentioned, but so far we do not see it working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From now until the election of the new assembly, Plaid Cymru intends to introduce a series of policies on the development of the Welsh economy, to see how that can be achieved within the restricted powers that the new assembly will have on rates and taxes. We will have to press London and the Select Committee on European Legislation for other developments. In welcoming the document "Pathway to Prosperity" and as one who recognises the size of the problem, I should say that we will all have to ensure that we get the answers. That should be the central part of the work of hon. Members in all parties from now until May, so that when we submit our manifestos to the Welsh electorate it will be possible to provide answers to the obvious problems that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. I remind the Committee and those hon. Members who mentioned the historical legacy that this was one of the five constituencies in Wales that produced a leader of the Labour party. The first leader of the Labour party represented this constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the document, which is very welcome. For many years, Wales has lacked the long-term thinking and strategy that the Government will now give us. I commend my right hon. Friend the Secretary of state and his colleagues for their work. I also commend his officials and advisers who have had some input into the document. We now have a longer-term strategy for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the amount of evidence in the report. As other hon. Members have said, it is candid and there is an honesty in it about low levels of GDP and about inequalities in earnings and investment between different parts of Wales and between England and Wales. Another important feature of the report is its focus on the need to strengthen the partnership between the public and private sectors. For too long, the private sector in Britain generally has been sceptical to hostile about the state's role in helping to boost private investment. The state and some political parties, including my own, have at times been hostile to the private sector. It is a great tribute to the new Government that some of those old hostilities are breaking down. My party and other parties understand that there must be a partnership between the public and private sectors. The Conservative party has not learnt that lesson, and it got a drubbing at last year's election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important feature of the report is that social policy goes hand in hand with economic policy. An unfortunate feature of the previous Government was that they talked about economic policy in a total vacuum. It was as if economic policy was not related to the social conditions in which people lived, the social circumstances of their employment and levels of remuneration or the structure of the social services on which they depended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
There are important principles in the report. There is the fact that economic prosperity must go hand in hand with reducing social exclusivity. There is also the Government's principle of social inclusiveness. We all remember the boom that occurred under the previous Government, when one third of the population became significantly better off, one third were no better off and one third were significantly worse off. That rapid rise in poverty characterised the economic boom under the previous Government and led to a recession. The present Government must not go back to that strategy of boom and bust. We need sensible economic growth that is tied to social responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the emphasis on equal opportunities in the policy document—another feature that was lacking under the previous Government. I also welcome the emphasis on the role of women. There has traditionally been a low economic rate among women in Wales. There is a need to bring more minority groups into economic activity. That includes people with disabilities, women, younger people and people who have been through unemployment who have been prevented from making a reasonable living in their own communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report emphasises the attack on low pay. We have had the national minimum wage announcement. Having been involved for 10 years in a campaign for a national minimum wage, I must confess that I was disappointed with the level that the Government recommend. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said, it will still be an important floor and will set the proper standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend wants to argue properly for appropriate minimum pay, he should go along with me in hoping that the Government will take some action on the two matters that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend that I have been involved in a campaign with the Monmouthshire Pensioners Forum for re-indexation. I have stated publicly on several occasions that when the Government announce their pensions review, there will once again be indexation with average earnings, but we shall have to wait and see whether that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the higher rate of income tax, my hon. Friend knows that the party that he and I represent, and with which we went into the election, made a clear commitment that there would not be a change in that higher rate. We must stick to that commitment for the period for which it was given. It would be a betrayal of the British people and of the people of Wales if we went back on it. After all, we were elected convincingly on it. Thus, I agree with a certain amount of what my hon. Friend said, but not everything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it ill behoves members of fringe parties to make wild announcements about what their policy on public expenditure will be without explaining what it will mean in terms of income tax for small businesses and small farmers in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend says, although I wonder whether it might have been an intervention for the previous speaker rather than for me. I was worried for a moment that my hon. Friend's reference to fringe parties was aimed at our hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). I am sure that it was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have suffered so much in this country from divorcing economic policy from social policy—for example, social security policy has been divorced from income tax policy. It is to the Government's credit that a new strategy will be introduced next year, which includes the moderately significant increases in child benefit, the introduction of a national minimum wage and the working families tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many people in our party were almost pleasantly surprised at the generosity of the working families tax credit; the many critics in the party had not thought of such a scheme, and it is to the Government's credit that the scheme to be introduced next year will ensure that anybody with a family who is on less than £9,000 a year will pay no tax at all. That is a radical measure for which members of our party ought to give the Government more credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Associated with those measures is the need to break down the barriers between people with families—especially women—and employment. The national child care strategy, which the Government introduced recently, is to be commended. We need to break down the barriers that are stopping people getting in to work and building up their own prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to what is said in the document about education. The Government are putting education at the forefront of their policies. It is important that we have higher standards at all levels in our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commitment to reduce infant school class sizes by putting in more resources has been particularly welcome in Monmouthshire. The new teachers who will be employed next September will largely eliminate the problem of large class sizes in Monmouthshire infant schools, although I shall have to check on that. However, the announcement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been welcomed in my constituency. I hope that there will be an extra teacher in a particular school in Torfaen in Ponthir, which I represent. I have raised that matter before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education cannot just be designed for the needs of the economy—it needs to be for people's general cultural and social development. I congratulate the Under-Secretary and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for meeting members of the Workers' Educational Association recently at a reception in the House. Other right hon. and hon. Members also attended. Such organisations are struggling because they are having to prove that performance targets are being hit and qualifications are being gained, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
cannot be the case in some forms of non-vocational, social education. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary consider the concerns of such organisations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also investing in higher education. It is commendable that close to my constituency there is the new University of Wales College, Newport, which is the most recent constituent college of the university of Wales. I wish that more people in my constituency regarded it as their local university. We need to publicise the work that is being done to promote access courses—a concept largely unknown in much of my constituency compared with other parts of the country where I have worked in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some concerns about the policy document. As other right hon. and hon. Members have said, it lacks a rural strategy. Two or three months ago, when the Committee last met, we debated the rural economy. It is rather disappointing that none of the Committee's thinking has been incorporated into the document. I have been calling for a White Paper on rural matters in Wales, and I sincerely hope that the Government will give more consideration to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For every job in agriculture, there are four or five jobs in related parts of the rural economy, a fact that the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs noted in its recent report. That report could have said more about rail transport links. I came down from London this morning, and I wondered what a new inward investor would make of it when coming to Merthyr for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first announcement that I heard on the London underground was that, because of industrial action, the trains would not stop at Paddington. The train from Paddington to Cardiff—from one capital city to another—was 25 minutes late. No hot food was available on the train because the microwave cooker was broken. On arrival at Cardiff station, I looked up to see when the next train would leave for Merthyr, but the timetable on my platform did not mention Merthyr. Had I been an inward investor coming to Merthyr for the first time, I should have thought that experience rather shabby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents are disappointed that Monmouth did not win the rail freight terminal grant, which went to Wentloog. However, it is to the credit of those involved in the project that they want a rail freight terminal in Newport, even if it is in competition with other rail freight terminals. I wish those involved in the consortium every success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of airports, the rather fanciful idea has been expressed that a Severnside international airport should be built in my constituency, and I use this opportunity to declare my opposition to that development. From my constituency, I can get to Birmingham airport, Bristol airport and Heathrow airport within an hour and a half; I can get to Gatwick airport in about two hours; and nearby is Cardiff airport, which is where future investment should go. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) will agree that we must stop the nonsense of a Severnside international airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document contains much that will help my constituency. I hope that those involved in investment and development in Monmouthshire, including small
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
businesses, will read the document and discover that it could help them. It shows the importance of partnership, of using the public and private sectors together; and it shows the importance of social policy being aligned with economic policy. I commend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many hon. Members have mentioned objective 1 status. I, too, believe that it will be a key opportunity—a once-ina-generation opportunity—to revive the ailing Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Neath, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, for giving Denbighshire and Conwy objective 1 status. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales on a sterling job in convincing his Cabinet colleagues, many of whom were fighting for objective 1 status for their own constituencies, of the Welsh case. I also congratulate the three Ministers who played a critical role: the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning; the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry; and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. Their guiding principle as fairness, not favours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Welsh delegation, I have met two of those Ministers in the past week to press the case for objective 1 status for Wales. I shall have a further meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on 21 July. Again, I shall be pressing the case for objective 1 status for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to congratulate those who supplied the robust, independent figures that helped us to convince the decision makers that Wales justified having objective 1 status. They include the Cardiff business school, the House of Commons Library, the Welsh Office and the Wales European Centre. Having spoken to key Ministers about the issue, I believe that we have as strong a case as anywhere in the United Kingdom for objective 1 status. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) referred to a figure of 75 per cent., but I put it at 80 to 85 per cent. However, important decisions have still to be taken and nothing is guaranteed beyond the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be foolish of us not to make contingency plans for the start date of objective 1, which is January 2000—only 17 months away. The Welsh Office said that European grants will amount to £200 million per annum over the six-year period for 15 Welsh counties and that that will be topped up to £1.8 billion. That is a massive injection into the Welsh economy and will provide the finance and resources to help turn round the economy of Wales. It is a one-off opportunity because, beyond the year 2006, the expansion of the European Union will mean limited resources and finance will be sent eastward. That is why it is crucial that the money is spent wisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge that a balanced approach is taken on how the money is spent. I would not favour, as a priority, spending massive amounts of money on inducements to multinationals or national companies. Such companies show confidence in our country, as they do in the Welsh work force, and they appreciate the Welsh environment.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
That is important because it has a cumulative effect on the confidence of the Welsh people. Spending must be balanced; we cannot go only for the multinationals and the nationals. It has cost £30,000 a job in subsidy, for example, at LG in Newport. Jobs that have been created in the small and medium-sized business sector in north Wales amount to only £3,000 in subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What type of projects could be carried out in Wales if we were granted objective 1 status? I asked House of Commons Library staff to provide me with such statistics and I was surprised, as they were, that such information is not held centrally in Europe. The staff had to consult the worldwide web to find examples for me. I shall be taking up that issue with the five Welsh Members of the European Parliament. Such information should be held centrally. It is astonishing that so many negative stories about Europe appear in the press daily on, for example, straight bananas and curly cucumbers. Details of successes throughout Europe should be at our fingertips, so that we can counter those negative stories. Best practice should be spread throughout Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Library furnished me with some examples, however, to show what can be done with objective 1 funding. Considerable amounts have been spent in Greece on the electrification of the railway system that connects Thessaloniki to Athens, cutting down the travelling time from seven hours to four hours. I should like the money to be used to electrify the north Wales railway line, so that Welsh products can be transported to the centre of Europe in the minimum time possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Saarland, an EU investment of 0.86 million ecu has helped to establish an ecological centre. Tens of thousands of people have visited it and it has spread knowledge on different ecological issues. Such investment would be excellent for the centre for alternative technology at Machynlleth. It would enable best practice to be spread throughout north Wales, and farmers could receive advice on a range of issues—the organic issue has already been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Caserta in Campania in Italy, a European Union investment of 14 million ecu helped to build a goldsmiths' centre. Goldsmiths were working in rickety back-room shops, and their excellent workmanship was recognised. Caserta is now one of the foremost centres for jewellery. I should like something like that to be done in Wales. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, said that we should have a sectional approach and I believe in that. We should recognise our strengths and play to them. I urge having a centre for opto-electronics based in St. Asaph. There are 16 opto-electronic companies, including Pilkingtons, which is a world leader, in north Wales. If they could be centralised and provided with research and development facilities, we in north Wales could have one of the foremost electronic centres in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final example is a little nearer to home, showing a change of perspective. I refer to the pathways to integration project in Merseyside, which suffers from the same ailments and problems as Wales, such as high unemployment, lack of opportunity, outward migration, poor health and poor housing. In Liverpool, the worst
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
affected areas were split into small neighbourhoods and communities and the people were asked what prevented their communities from developing. If and when we receive objective 1 money, a wealth of experts are available to give advice, including staff in the Welsh Office, the WDA, the Wales in Europe centre and local authorities. We should listen to grassroots opinion. I urge that we copy the Merseyside example. We must connect with our communities and ask them what help they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a cautionary tale from my constituency—the Vale of Clwyd—where there was a grandiose scheme to redevelop Rhyl promenade and Prestatyn beach without proper consultation with the local people. The ideas gestated in just a few minds. Massive grants of £7 million and £10 million were spent without proper consultation. As a result, there was a multimillion pound development of a children's village—a children's shopping centre, in essence. The rents were so high that no local person could afford them and the properties remained empty for years. There was a 200-space underground car park, which remained empty in the winter and under-used in the summer. We must not repeat those mistakes. We should consult our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made excellent progress in the past six months in gaining objective 1 status for a large portion of Wales. I pay tribute to the ministerial team that helped to secure it, but we must not let our vigilance slip. We need to keep up the pressure until we achieve objective 1 for Wales. We must also make contingency plans for gaining objective 1 status. The plans must have a balanced approach. We need to attract large national and multinational companies while nurturing our own home-grown companies. All plans and policies must consider the needs and aspirations of the people they are supposed to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have been taken back to a time when Wales was overdependent on three industries, as is stated in the White Paper: agriculture, coal and steel. That is certainly the Wales that I remember from when I was brought up near Wrexham. Wrexham had a grim atmosphere. I was taken around by my grandfather from the age of about four—from when I can first remember.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wrexham has now been absolutely transformed. I spent a couple of years as the candidate there; I was defeated by the hon. Member for Wrexham. It was a most interesting time, and I learnt much about the Wrexham economy. It was extraordinary to discover how it has been transformed during the past 20 years by companies such as Sharp, JCB and Kellogg. Kellogg has 36 plants worldwide; its most efficient is in Wrexham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the hon. Gentleman was not paying attention or he did not understand the irony of what I said. The inheritance to which I referred is the spending plans.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful explanation, but throughout his speech, he also made derogatory comments about the performances of the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Secretary of State for paying tribute to the efforts of the previous Government. Paragraph 3.14 of the White Paper, which concerns inward investment, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it has been outstandingly successful, with over 75,000 people now employed in 300 overseas manufacturing companies in Wales."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State sent us a little memorandum, for which I am grateful, which also pays tribute to the extraordinary success of the inward investment strategy of the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is with some trepidation that I take on the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones), who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, he said that there was no strategy for Wales. There was; it was to bring in manufacturing industry. As the Secretary of State has said, the team approach led to more than 1,800 inward investment projects—an investment of almost £12 billion and more than 175,000 new and safeguarded jobs. That strategy was extremely successful, but as the Secretary of State pointed out, we must now go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a tribute to the success of that strategy that people are knocking the LG investment. People are asking whether it is drawing too much investment to south-east Wales, and whether we should be considering the more rural parts. The obvious answer is yes, but surely it was right to go for big projects in the areas most clobbered by the demise of the old industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some earlier comments, particularly those by Plaid Cymru Members, displayed an extraordinarily naïve
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
belief in the beneficient effect of EC funds. They are chasing a chimera. First, the volume of funds that went to Ireland, for example, will never come to this country. Many hon. Members, including the Secretary of State, have mentioned Ireland. I was on a Select Committee on Welsh Affairs trip to Ireland, and I drew a very different conclusion to that drawn by many other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland has been given an extraordinary sum of money—mainly, we could say, by the British taxpayer. Last year, we contributed £1.8 billion; and Ireland received £1.8 billion sterling. That is a substantial sum; and that is good for Ireland. It represented about 5 per cent. of Irish gross domestic product. That is an enormous sum, and I think that the Irish have spent it wisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talked to the president of the Irish Development Agency, who said that if push came to shove, he would forgo tomorrow all EC funds—5 per cent. of Irish GDP—so long as Ireland could hang on to the extraordinary advantage that it has enjoyed of 10 per cent. corporation tax on inward investment and 12.5 per cent. corporation tax until 2023, which is the new deal that has been struck with the Commission. Several other officials and many businesses that we met confirmed that investors in Ireland stay because of the extraordinarily good corporation tax deal that they get. Wales should learn from that important lesson. Although it is not in the remit of the Secretary of State for Wales to decide global macro-economic policy, he should put across the message about the impact of taxation on a part of the economy that is on the edge. By its nature, the western parts of Wales are on the edge of the British economy and the way to attract people there is to keep taxation and regulation low—as business after business and the Federation of Small Businesses have said. Many initiatives in the White Paper may be welcome, but the average entrepreneur—all the way back to my ancestor—goes into business to make money. The quickest way to hang on to profits is for the state not to confiscate them. Low taxation is the key to Ireland's success. There is no doubt that the Irish have benefited from the EC, as they acknowledge, but it was low taxation that drew people to Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That trip to Ireland was most interesting. As members of the Committee have said, Ireland has specifically chosen niche market industries, which can move easily, such as pharmaceuticals. Viagra is made there. A viagra plant can be set up quickly—the company will probably have to build more, the way things are going. The company needs a green field, a skilled work force and to be near America, where it has its head office. Ireland has also gone for telecommunications and information technology industries in a very interesting and focused, if narrow, way. However, before members of the Committee admire Ireland too much, I should say that the people we met were very complimentary about what is happening in Wales. They said that if an auto project comes to them, they say, "We cannot handle that here; go to Wales. They've got the infrastructure and the back suppliers." We should not underestimate what has happened in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper was weak on those points and I hope that the Secretary of State will take that criticism
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
back to his colleagues in government. It was unacceptable that it devoted only 28 lines to agriculture, given the predominance of that industry in large areas of Wales. We had a debate on agriculture at our previous sitting and a document of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs also made some sensible suggestions on the subject. We visited a yoghurt plant on the west coast; milk does not travel well and there are real opportunities for adding value to basic agricultural raw material by making cheese, yoghurt and so on. Again, I hope that the Minister will give us more detail on agriculture. Things could be done. For example, the Secretary of State could encourage the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to knock on the head the 90 per cent. Milk Marque threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are not here to discuss agriculture and I shall move on because there is much to debate. I should, again, have liked more detail on infrastructure in the White Paper, although I know that we have to wait for the separate White Paper on that subject. The overwhelming majority of goods and people in Wales are moved by diesel-powered and petrol-fuelled vehicles. The White Paper gives no hint of the importance of that or of the impact of the swingeing increase that the Government are introducing on diesel duties—diesel is 30 to 40 per cent. more expensive in the United Kingdom than in France, while vehicle excise duty in France is a sixth of what it is here. There should have been at least a paragraph on the importance of the motor vehicle to the Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, it is not good enough to say that the previous Government did nothing on infrastructure. The A55 was a huge investment, for example. Some sections of it are built on the sea bed; I once met a civil engineer who told me that it is the most expensive section of road in western Europe. It has brought real wealth and jobs to the west coast and, if the Minister can bear to be reminded of it once more, linking it to the trunk road south of Wrexham would bring real advantages to Wales. New roads bring prosperity, new business and new jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another lesson from Ireland was the benefit of improving telecommunications. When I used to go to Ireland on holiday, the telephone system was laughably bad—it is now a key to Ireland having attracted communications industries, particularly telephone services. The Government should make the establishment of universal mobile phones in every valley in Wales an absolute priority. Yet again, the White Paper is weak on the subject and I should like more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the White Paper reflects the muddle that the Government have got into on energy as a result of the conflicting requirements of keeping everyone happy: old friends in the mining industry, new friends who have been given promises at Kyoto and all the rest of us who want cheaper energy to ensure that our businesses are competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper contains virtually nothing on energy. A token paragraph fails to point out that the Government's dithering has put at risk several thousand jobs in the gas industry to preserve a few old jobs in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
coal industry. Coal will return, I have no doubt. It has huge calorific value. Give it a few years—perhaps 100—and the technology will be there to extract it. However, the industry is disappearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have promises to make British business competitive, but they have not done so. They have pandered to one sector and have not aimed for cheap energy. That is a burden on Welsh industry—as are the numerous other macro-economic mistakes that the Government have made. They did nothing last year to encourage saving or to try to dampen down consumption. They left everything to the independent Bank of England. We have experienced successive interest rate rises, with a catastrophic effect on the exchange rate, as the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said. The exchange rate is unacceptably high, as can be seen from the results. Hon. Members need not listen to me—they can read 
	<i>The Economist this</i> week, which says that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Britain's industrial production fell by a surprisingly sharp 1.2 per cent. in May",</p></blockquote>
or 
	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> which said on Sunday that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Manufacturing output recorded its third consecutive fall in May."</p></blockquote>
That is bad news. The Government have not acknowledged the real damage that is being done to manufacturing. They received a good inheritance. Welsh unemployment, at 5.6 per cent., is well below that in many other countries—it is about half of the level in France and almost a quarter of that in Spain. Nevertheless, more burdens are being imposed on Welsh business, under the presumption that an unending flow of young entrepreneurs will want to come forward and take risks; they will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum wage and the "Fairness at Work" White Paper are extra burdens. They do not sound an awful lot, but they will deter people from taking on labour and from taking risks. A small plumbing business in Wrexham was considering taking on young assistants; it will not now do so, because of the risks and complications of employing people. The Government and the other Opposition parties have not taken on board that to take people on, businesses must have the ability to lose people. That is a blunt fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The minimum wage must not be lost on an emotional argument. The argument always returns to emotion. I can cite an example of a garage near me, where a man started from nothing. He bought a derelict garage in the middle of an isolated rural village, established the business, and he now employs seven people. He currently takes on young school leavers and pays them £2.50 an hour. He gives them discipline—they get used to getting up in the morning. He admits that they get in the way, but he helps them and brings them up to NVQ level. After a couple of years, they earn £3.50, then £5 or £6. He pays his top fitters about £7 an hour. That is how the real world works—a young guy takes risks. He now has a booming business—in the middle of nowhere, a well established garage services

	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
cars. Running small, country garages is supposed to be a doomed business. That man is doing a great service to those young people. He has now told me that if the minimum wage is introduced, he will not be able to afford to pay school leavers £3.60, because for the first couple of years, their labour is worth nothing. Therefore, he will go to an agency and take a fully qualified fitter off the shelf at £6 an hour, and if that fitter is no good on day one, that fitter is out, and the owner will go to another agency and get another one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Under pressure from the Institute of Directors, the CBI and other agencies, the Government backed off. However, I think that it is cruel for you, Mr. Jones, as a middle-class Member of Parliament—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—or for me, as a middle-class Member of Parliament, to specify a level and say that some people may not be paid above that level, simply because our consciences require it. Labour Members are talking about salving their consciences. I would like to see those young people going to that garage, learning to get up in the morning and which end of a spanner is which, working their way through to NVQs and ending up happily employed in a successful little business employing six or seven people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Mr. Jones, as I know you will call time sharpish, I want to ask who will make the decision in Wales. That is important, given the speed in which the world economy is developing and the fierce new competition that will come from Asia. Asian factories that have been built in the past 20 years will not go away, nor will the skilled work forces. They will hit us with extremely good products at good prices, offering real competition. Decision making in Wales will therefore have to be of the highest order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned, as I said during the debate on devolution, that we will have too many agencies. I pick up the point of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney who spoke about having a strong, responsible Secretary of State. Toyota on Deeside had problems as the project was coming to a head. At a critical moment David Hunt, now Lord Hunt, flew out and met Dr. Toyoda face to face and ironed out the problem. That is a classic case of a responsible Secretary of State making a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now worried, as is the CBI and other agencies, that in addition to the assembly, MPs, MEPs, local authorities, the new WDA, TECs, the regional forums and enterprise agencies will all be involved. Who will drive through these decisions when someone comes to Wales with a project, because it will be even more difficult in future to land these projects? It will not get any easier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

particular interest in being here because three generations of my family were here in the last century. Some of them worked for the ancestors of the hon. Member for Shropshire, North, although certainly not for a minimum wage. They worked as blacksmiths in Cyfarthfa iron works and produced many chapel railings and gates all over Wales. In their spare time, they conducted the brass band which won third prize in the great exhibition brass band competition. It was the only band in Britain that could play a Beethoven symphony from beginning to end. Joseph Parry used to compose for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this century three generations of my family have lived slightly to the north, in Breconshire, in the more rural areas. I think that I have an understanding of both the rural and industrial problems that confront Wales. I apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire who, because of his expertise on Northern Ireland matters, is required at Westminster where he is being consulted on the present problems at Drumcree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good and open debate on many issues. The "Pathway to Prosperity" document has been strong on analysis and is thought provoking. Chapter 3 states that the GDP per capita in Wales in roughly half that of Oregon in the USA, which has a similar population. It is interesting to think that many people left Merthyr Tydfil and emigrated to Oregon almost for the same reasons 100 years ago. Its GDP is still twice that of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also thought provoking to look at the GDP per head for the United Kingdom regions and to realise that the GDP in London is £4,300 greater than it is in Wales. The huge disparities in this document are extremely telling and make us analyse the endemic problems of Wales. I have great sympathy with the analysis of what happened by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. My grandfather went down Plymouth colliery in Troedyrhiw at the age of 14—certainly not on a minimum wage. I know in some depth about the area's great problems. In this century we have abandoned, at our peril, many sound economic philosophies. Some of them were rubbished in the 1980s. I happened still to be a Keynesian economist. It is interesting that new Labour have introduced the new deal concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lloyd George and Keynes took their new deal ideas to Roosevelt and he put them into practice. The mixed economy philosophy that I believe we need in Wales
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
flowered in the States, in the Tennessee valley authority and many similar projects, which created employment. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney rightly said that creating 200,000 jobs in Wales is a mountain to climb. It will require massive investment. If we were to consult the likes of Professor J.K. Galbraith, we should be told that we need considerable public as well as private investment in a mixed economy to solve our problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transport infrastructure is lamentable in many parts of Wales. I refer the Minister and the Committee to the articles in the magazine of the Institute for Welsh Affairs. I wrote a strong section, I think, on transport infrastructure. My hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire quoted some of it this morning. There is a huge need for infrastructure—for road and rail improvements. I agree strongly with the remarks of the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) about the electrification of the rail system. That is vital and such projects would create a great deal of work in Wales. We must look forward, beyond the Heads of the Valleys road. Sometimes people in cars believe that life stops at that road, but there is an awful lot of Wales beyond it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many analyses of the agricultural crisis have been offered today. I have noted relevant comments made from a sedentary position and the document contains quite a lot about rural investment. Fair enough, it contains an analysis of the rural situation and I agree with much of it, but there is not much about agriculture, which needs specific mention. The figure of up to 25 per cent. of the population of rural Wales—the number engaged in agriculture—has been quoted already. After virtually a 90 per cent. drop in incomes and with agriculture bankrupt at DM3 to the pound, we are not making much progress. As I asked on Wednesday in the House, will Ministers persuade the Chancellor to ease up on his policy of a strong pound and bring it down to a better exchange rate? Substantial damage is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourism, which has been said to be in need of reorganisation, also needs to be democratised. The Wales tourist board is a quango. It needs people who know something about tourism. When the assembly begins its work, the management of tourism in Wales, with a reconstructed Welsh tourist board, should consist of assembly members with some expertise and knowledge of tourism alongside tourism professionals who know what they are talking about and officers who have had hands-on experience of tourism. The industry has a huge potential for growth, but it has grown by only 0.5 per cent. in the past five years. The Brecon Beacons national park is the only national park in the whole of Britain that has seen the number of visitors to it decline. Some tourism hotspots, which did extremely well in the past, now have half the number of visitors that they once had. Tourism has vast potential to grow because of the quality of our countryside and the venues that tourists can visit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget of £5 million to £6 million for tourism in Wales is inadequate when compared to the £16 million for Eire and £11 million for Scotland. We are not competing in the tourism marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
I am pleased to see the document's emphasis on training and education. Vocational training has much potential, but we must consider the future of the TECs. Do they and the training companies with contracts with the TECs have a future? What strategy will there be to provide vocational training in Wales? There are some pointers in the document, but I hope that the Minister will develop them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a special plea to the Minister to consider making strenuous efforts to bring a regiment or units that must return to Britain from Germany back to the Cwrt-y-gollen camp near Crickhowell. That would assist the economy not only in Crickhowell, but in Abergavenny and the Heads of the Valleys area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the establishment of the assembly in 1999. Its economic committee will be extremely important, and the document gives some pointers to the type of economic policy that might be introduced. However, we know very little about how much money will be used to back it and whether, as the right hon. Member for Caernarfon said, it will be matched funding for objective 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am discussing structural funds, may I thank the Minister for his statement last Wednesday that Powys will receive objective 2 status and will have its own NUTS 3 area? We are grateful for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The priorities are quality employment, a vast reduction in unemployment, and increasing wage levels. We face a huge challenge. We need better education and training for skills, more indigenous industry and financial assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet mentioned the banking and financial service sector, which is very important. However, "Contemporary Wales" points out that south-west England has 81 companies involved in the banking and financial service industries and that Wales has only 23. Wales has lost the Chemical Bank from Cardiff where 300 people worked at its headquarters. It is a Bournemouth-based operation and many of the jobs have gone there. Banking in Wales is going backwards, but we desperately need a banking system to support our own industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need actively to encourage entrepreneurs, and I am glad to see that point in the document. We must train them and provide them with risk capital. Wales has people of high intelligence and with potential. However, they have not always been given the opportunities that they need to create wealth and employment for local people. We need investment, leadership and inclusiveness and we must ensure that our young people are ready for the challenges of the next century. If they are given the tools, nothing will stop our progress as a nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project must succeed, but it must succeed with a will. We must all meet the challenge and work together to make Wales succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
be a good description as my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, is in trouble for selecting a track from the Verve on "Desert Island Discs".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many valuable contributions, and I shall not necessarily reply in the order of importance in which I regard them because I shall begin by dealing with the speech by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where is he?"] He did not repeat the immediate, knee-jerk response that he and his Conservative colleagues made to "Pathway to Prosperity". He dismissed the document as a series of public relations soundbites. However, now that he has read it, he must realise that he cannot dismiss it in that way. The document announces about 21 action plans, and it is certainly not a shopping list. As hon. Members—including my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney—have said, it is brutally honest. Indeed, one criticism that might have been made of it was that a Government document should not be so brutally honest. It sets stiff targets and shows the extent of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Ribble Valley criticises the document, he is criticising the whole partnership that helped to develop it. He is criticising institutions such as the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses, the TUC and the Welsh Development Agency, and the various academics and economists on whose views and expertise the Government drew. Like my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I do not agree with everything in the 
	<i>Western Mail,</i> and I am not sure whether it sells any copies in Ribble Valley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ribble Valley might not have noticed that the 
	<i>Western Mail</i> praised "Pathway to Prosperity", describing it as an excellent agenda, and stating that it was one of the most "sensible pieces of paperwork" to emerge from the Welsh Office in recent years. Although, given what has emerged from the Welsh Office in recent years, that might not be a good comparison. The editorial also stated that the document made "fascinating reading" and provided the basis for "sustained and true growth" across Wales. That is fairly representative of the responses that we have had to the document, and the contributions in Committee have taken the debate forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with the hon. Member for Ribble Valley on another matter. He made various comments about unemployment in manufacturing and so on. Unemployment almost trebled under the Conservative Government; in large parts of Wales, manufacturing was decimated under the Thatcher Government in the early 1980s. None the less, the hon. Gentleman attacks the minimum wage, which is a key part of the Government's programme, as my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth made clear. The minimum wage will benefit 125,000 people in Wales who are trapped in poverty. That is significant. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley might not care about people trapped in poverty, but the Government care and we are determined to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) treated us to a series of—admittedly interesting—anecdotes about his experiences of
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
holidaying in Ireland, "a garage near me" and his pride at being a descendant of Robert Crawshay. Whatever else Robert Crawshay did, he was responsible ultimately for the Merthyr riots, when the red flag was first raised there. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman wants to take credit for that, but that is his ancestor's historic role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reference was made to Dic Penderyn.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a minute. I welcome the right hon. Gentleman's comments.

Perhaps their presence on this Welsh Grand Committee will help educate them in the new realities of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I drew attention to Robert Crawshay because he created a business that employed 20,000 people. Apparently the Minister and the right hon. Member for Caernarfon are so disgusted with him that they intend to write to the council, asking that his window be taken down. If he was such a villified figure, what on earth is he doing there? He created this town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should not have risen to the bait. What is important is that the individual of whom we speak is part of Merthyr's heritage. The council is simply acknowledging that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much more thoughtful speech came from the hon. Member for Meirionnydd nant Conwy, except that at one point I thought that he would be sent off for displaying a David Beckham-like tendency in retaliating against the Chair of the Committee. He pointed out the real problems in his constituency, and in many of ours, of the culture of dependency on benefits of generations of young people, and the way that is now escalating into a life of drugs and despair. This is a genuine problem that the Government seek to address. My fellow Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) is leading a programme that seeks to tackle social exclusion, and it includes that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a number of points—some fair, others less so—about the Wales tourist board. I draw his attention to the fact that the board will be starting an additional British marketing campaign on 18 July to attract more families into Wales to stem the difficulties caused partly by the high pound and partly by the bad weather in Wales in recent months, which I freely admit have caused enormous problems for the tourist industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future of the Wales tourist board will be a matter for the Assembly—my right hon. Friend, in his White Paper, has deliberately made that so. The tourist board has responsibility for the 1999 rugby world cup and would not wish to be in the middle of a great reorganisation in the run-up to that significant event.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
Therefore, I caution against necessarily absorbing the board into the assembly—or the WDA for that matter. There is a Scottish tourist board, there is a British Tourist Authority and, at least for the present, an English tourist board. We do not want to set up a Welsh tourist board and have Wales somehow disappear from that network. That is the problem with automatically assuming that it will be abolished, although I repeat that it is a matter for the National Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may be able to learn from the Scottish experience. There is a free-standing Scottish tourist board, but the nuts and bolts of giving grants and economic assistance come under a development board. Of course we need a free-standing tourist board, but I wonder whether we might be better off having section 4 grants under a development powerhouse as opposed to a free-standing board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that interesting point which I am sure the assembly will wish to consider. In the meantime, perhaps we can consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect that we have asked the Wales tourist board to consider is a much stronger regional focus to mesh with the regions of Wales as defined under the assembly, the Welsh Development Agency, the TECs and the different economic forums. It could benefit from that. There is a structural imbalance within regional tourist companies and there is no direct linkage—in terms of accountability and coherence—with the tourist board. We will need to do something about that. The hon. Gentleman said that the document was well meaning and well intentioned—I am grateful for that—but that there was no money in it. However, about half a billion pounds is tied up in the various programmes and initiatives that comprise our coherent strategy set out in the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: New money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that, but there is some new money in the new deal—to the tune of £190 million coming specifically into Wales over the next three to four years. That programme shows that the Government have broken free from Tory spending shackles: £3.5 billion was raised from the windfall tax and new money has been invested in education, public health and other services. It is not true to say that we have been cowed by a Thatcherite agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of years ago I had the privilege of hearing my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney lecture on the history of Merthyr, the industrial revolution and its wider implications for the economy of south Wales. It was fascinating and he held the interest of the entire audience for an hour and a quarter—not many people can do that—in a packed hall in Neath. He made similar points today though rather more succinctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should indeed draw on and learn from the history of Merthyr and my hon. Friend provided some important insights—particularly on the power of
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
government. That is why the Government do not accept that everything should be left to market forces, as Thatcherism and more muddled Majorism did. We believe in intervention and we want to develop partnerships with employers and employees, businesses and unions, and with other economic agencies. That is vital, and a successful economic agenda cannot be carried forward without such an approach. However, many of my hon. Friend's other points about the macro-economy would bear closer examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said, we have been candid in saying that the Welsh economy is 200,000 jobs short of requirements. Addressing that problem will be a huge task but we wanted to be honest and not to produce propaganda or public relations puff. We wanted to lay it all out as we saw it—the tremendous achievements of the Welsh economy but also the problems that it faces. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend for his praise of the new deal and its associated micro-economic measures, as set out in the document. I pay tribute to him for his active role in seeking to drive the new deal forward in Merthyr and I thank him for giving the Employment Service the benefit of his advice at a recent consultative conference in Cardiff. My hon. Friend was the only Member of Parliament present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to move on to public spending and its relationship to the comprehensive spending review whose results are to be announced by the Chancellor tomorrow and will impact on Wales. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is adopting an unusual approach to Welsh public spending, which will flow from the comprehensive spending review and other initiatives—he intends to consult all parties in Wales about how the budget should be distributed. That is a positive sign, part of his wider approach of governing by consent rather than by diktat. Conservative Members should learn from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney spoke about the historical importance of inward investment. He is right, but we should not neglect the importance for the future of small and medium-sized enterprises. Not enough attention has been paid to the indigenous or home-grown economy of Wales. The document seeks to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire congratulated us, if I recall correctly, on our foresight and vision. I agree with that. However, I disagree with his suggestion—which, I am sorry to say, he shared with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and, more predictably, with the hon. Member for North Shropshire—that we have neglected rural policy and agriculture in the document. It contains repeated references to the importance of rural policy, of the rural economy and of agriculture. Pages 10, 24 and 27 contain paragraphs referring to those matters. Our approach to the rural economy and to the role of agriculture in the Welsh economy is not to parcel it off into a side compartment, but to make it central. That is why we have reorganised the Welsh Development Agency and why we have adopted this approach to the economic agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
We certainly do not expect rural areas to benefit from a trickle-down effect from urban areas. On the contrary; rural areas need distinct support strategies. We are attempting to provide those strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum wage is important to Welsh rural economies which are—almost without exception—lowwage areas. It will help to boost demand and to increase economic activity in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that regional airports require more investment. That includes Cardiff international airport, which has the potential to become one of Britain's largest and most successful airports. I agree with the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire about that. Indeed, I visited Welshpool airport with him. I am rather glad that I did not accept an invitation to be flown by him. I am sure that his piloting expertise is greater than his paragliding expertise. However, in view of what happened to him, I am glad that I did not accept his offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the request—expressed by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and echoed by many other hon. Members—for an even spread of prosperity across Wales. I remind the Committee that economic inactivity is a serious problem for Wales and is much more severe here than in other parts of Britain. West Wales has an economic inactivity rate of 27 per cent. That is ridiculously high: it indicates a hidden joblessness on top of the claimant count. East Wales has a lower economic inactivity rate of 22 per cent. Nevertheless, that figure is still far too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South, who is the Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, made a number of thoughtful points. He referred to the need for a one-stop shop. That is partly why we are seeking to revamp Business Connect Wales and to bring it into a closer relationship with other economic agencies, such as the Welsh Development Agency and training and enterprise councils. That is specified in the document. However, I must caution against my hon. Friend's request for continual institutional tinkering. We will get so bogged down in institutionalitis that we will not have time to drive forward our policy agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West made a number of key points. He said that we are not seeking to redistribute economic activity from east to west Wales. East Wales has pockets of serious poverty, including my hon. Friend's Cardiff constituency. However, we must bring to west Wales the benefits of inward investment and prosperity that have been enjoyed in east, north and south Wales
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not rejecting a sectoral approach, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West said. In the document we reject sectoral parochialism. We mentioned a number of sectors in our consultation document. A whole lot of people piled in and wanted to know why we had not mentioned them. We are trying to play to our strengths—the hon. Member for Clwyd, South used that phrase. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd mentioned the excellence of optoelectronics in St. Asaph, which is in his constituency. We want to encourage such industries and others, including those which produce automotive products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West for his praise for the document. I endorse what he said about stressing the importance of small businesses. I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Caernarfon for welcoming the document, but I do not agree with him that we are in a depression. We may be entering an economic slowdown following a period of high growth. However, if south-east England and other parts of Britain are overheating, Wales certainly is not. That is one of the problems with which we are wrestling. The pound is unquestionably too high, which is due mostly to the previous Conservative Government and partly to uncertainty over the euro. I hope that it can be brought down to a more reasonable level. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon asked about regional selective assistance. We will be consulting on that, and he and others will have the opportunity to give their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) about the importance of social policy going hand in hand with economic policy. The document acknowledges that. One of the Conservative Government's crimes was that there were booms in prosperity for some people, but massive increases in inequality for many others. Economic efficiency and social justice must be brought together, and the document aims to do that. My hon. Friend was right to remind the Committee that the working families tax credit will mean that no family will pay tax on less than £11,000 per year, which is an enormous boost for low-paid people. No working family will have an income of less than £9,000 per year. The most recent Budget was hugely redistributive, although not much was made of the fact. I endorse my hon. Friend's points about the Workers' Educational Association, which is a very valuable agency. The Secretary of State and I were lobbied by it at a recent reception at the House of Commons. That is the acceptable face of lobbying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd made some valid points about regional selective assistance. The problem, especially for the outlying westward areas of Wales, is that sufficient applications for RSA are not made. That is a serious issue that must be addressed. I ask members of the Committee to encourage more applications and to encourage their own authorities to begin to prepare for objective 1 funding with projects and infrastructure improvements. Such initiatives take a long time to roll out, and we need to be well prepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire spoke about training and the future of the training and enterprise councils. Those matters will be addressed by the education and training action group, which is due to report before the establishment of the assembly. The Secretary of State announced today an important package of new jobs for Merthyr. OP Chocolate will invest a further £1.5 million and create more than 50 new jobs at its existing Merthyr facility. That is very welcome. As I announced today, I will meet the coalfields community campaign and other interested groups including, most crucially, local authorities, to discuss how we can take forward our new agenda for the valleys.

A key step towards lifting the export ban is the proposal for a United Kingdom date-based export scheme and I am hopeful that rapid progress can now be made.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 12 June I was delighted to launch a manual "Wales—The Time is Now", prepared by 10 of Wales' most influential organisations, aimed at helping those concerned to talk in a consistent way about the special qualities that Wales has to offer. I have arranged for copies of the manual to be available in the Vote Office and the Libraries of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important initiative on which we must build. I want to see a partnership of organisations in Wales, in both the public and the private sectors, take this forward establishing a national message which covers the full diversity of Welsh life and the opportunities which Wales has to offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The competition for inward investment is tough and is likely to get tougher. However, continued emphasis on all of the positive features that Wales has to offer, regular re-assessment of our inward investment strategy and the continued growth of our indigenous businesses, will ensure that we compete favourably in the short, medium and longer term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
