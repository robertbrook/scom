	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we have been away on a short break, I have been giving careful consideration to points raised in our earlier discussion by the hon. Member for Slough (Mr. Watts) who, saldy, is not here at present. He raised what appeared to be a separate aspect of the groups of companies problem, which I also raised with the Chief Secretary. On more careful examination, I find that the points made by the hon. Member for Slough and by me are complementary, not contradictory. I am surprised that the Chief Secretary did not pick that up in his response. Our point is that it is the overall limit for qualifying for small companies relief that is important, rather than the constituent parts of the group of companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Slough argued that if a group of companies made a £200,000 aggregate profit, small companies relief should be available on all the profit, even though it were distributed unevenly among the four constituent companies. Taking a group of companies, four constituent member companies and a £200,000 aggregate profit, the hon. Gentleman argued that all four companies should qualify for taxation at the small companies rate. That might not happen, but it would happen if each company had a profit of £50,000 so that the aggregate figure was divided equally among all four companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the distribution were unbalanced and one company had a profit of £90,000, another a profit of £90,000, a third a profit of £20,000, and the fourth a profit of nil, only the company with a profit of £20,000 would qualify for its entire profit at the small companies rate. The two companies making a profit of £90,000 would qualify partly at the 35 per cent. rate and partly at the 25 per cent. rate. The hon. Member for Slough highlighted a genuine anomaly. He suggested that the overall sum of £200,000 should be the trigger point for small companies relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that I was advancing approached the problem from a different angle. I was trying to ensure that we do not allow companies to massage their profits between different members of a group to avoid a relatively small amount of tax. However, I was making the same point in principle that it is the overall sum that is important. If a company is earning massively over £1 million profit in all, it should not be able to place some of its profits in small companies at a low rate of £10,000, £20,000 or £50,000 to get a tax advantage. The h M for Slough and I are making the same point and I hope that, as a result of that united call from both sides
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
of the Committee, the Chief Secretaryy will indeed consider the point that we are both making. The overall aggregate figure ought to be the determing factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained the rationale of the anti-fragmentation provisions in the taxation of small companies. Among other reasons, they are there to prevent companies from manipulating profits by placing profits with different companies for tax avoidance reasons. That is what the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) wants to stop. The anti-fragmentation provisions are there to stop companies writing their own tax bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not new procedures. They are not affected by the Bill and have existed in the tax system for many years. The hon. Gentleman seemed to be unhappy about them when he first spoke and my hon. Friend the Member for Slough explained clearly why such provisions were also essential for commercial reasons and why companies might want to split themselves up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He raised a particular point about how groups with foreign subsidiaries fitted into that pattern of relief and I have undertaken to look at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see anything much to look at in the hon. Gentleman's first remarks. We do not see great evidence of significant abuse of the procedures as they are framed at present. They are rather tight about splitting up the relief on a numerical basis between companies. Naturally, I shall consider what the hon. Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CAR BENEFITS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 13, line 36, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In Schedule 6, Paragraphs 3(1) and 3(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, the figure of "18,000" shall be deleted and "10,000" substituted."</p></blockquote>
This amendment concerns the definition of a car used preponderantly for business purposes. As hon. Members will know, where a director or an employee earning more than £8,500 per annum is given a company car which is also available for his private use, he is assessed on a scale charge. The law attempts to recognise that certain vehicles are less of a perk and more of a necessary tool of the business by providing that the scale charge is half if there is preponderant business use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1980, preponderant business use of a company car has been set at 18,000 miles. In recent years the scale charge has increased. It was doubled in 1988 and after a one third increase last year it is proposed under the clause to increase the charge by one fifth this year. The underlying principle of the benefits legislation is to charge the employee with the cost to the employer of providing the benefit. In the case of a car the cost per mile depends on the total.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the principle is to tax the employee on the real value of the benefit he receives, not to charge him the full cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. Gentleman and I are expressing the same principle: the employee has to pay the full charge. In the case of a car the cost per mile depends significantly on the total mileage travelled by the car. When a high business mileage is travelled, the cost of making the car available to the employee is much reduced. I understand that the figures published by the motoring organisations of the running costs per mile of cars are based on the assumption that all fixed costs of the vehicle are covered at an annual mileage of 10,000 miles, which explains the reference to 10,000 in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the tax charge on the employee recognises that fact, some employees will be more and more unfairly treated, and the result will be that many employers will introduce new and complex schemes to reduce the tax burden on their employees. That could create an unnecessary administrative burden for both employers and the revenue departments, as in the vast majority of cases private mileage will represent a low proportion of high business mileage. The amendment suggests that the scale charge be halved for all employees whose business mileage exceeds 10,000 rather than 18,000 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) but I cannot say that he brought any tears to my eyes for the business car user who drives only 11,000 miles on business and the balance in private motoring. It is not an amendment that should command much sympathy in the Committee. Perhaps the hon. Member for Eastwood should compare the costs of the car in two sets of circumstances: first, when the company provides the car and the employee has to pay the appropriate scale charge, and, secondly, when the company gives the employee extra salary so that he can buy or lease the car himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party, in some cases rightly, believes in level playing fields. Is this an example of a level playing field? I challenge hon. Gentlemen to think about that comparison. if they think that there is something wrong with the principle, they should jump up and down, and I will give them the chance to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be instructive to make this comparison between the company car—provided by the company—and the alternative of a salary increase. The cost to the company is to be the same. Under which scheme would the employee be better off? There should be some rough equality between the two arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of fact, the hon. Gentleman is wrong: a company car costs less to the employer than a salary increase because there is no national insurance on the company car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be answering
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
in some ways the argument of his hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood who tabled the amendment. He is already saying that there is no national insurance contribution on a company car. The argument of the hon. Member for Eastwood seems a little brazen now, and, as I hope to show, it is a gravy train argument and one that I hope both parties will roundly condemn, voting down the amendment of hon. Members for Eastwood by a large majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having advanced the principle, I should now like to compare a cash payment for the car by way of additional salary and the standard practice of providing company cars for employees. Most examples work out on roughly similar lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the employee earns £18,000 per annum, that he pays 25p in the pound income tax and that the company pays tax at the 35 per cent. rate. Let us assume also that the employee has a medium-sized car which is leased at £240 a month on a three-year contract and that the car would cost about £10,000 new, which is the average cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lease payment of £240 a month is £2,880 a year. VAT would not be charged on that. I assume that it would be recoverable. There would be corporation tax relief of £907, with the result that the cost to the company would be £1,973. The employee's national insurance contribution would be nil because there is none on that benefit in kind. On the proposed increased scale for a medium-sized car of more than 1400 cc but less than 2000 cc, tax would be payable on £2,200, and at the standard rate it would be £550.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative would be to give the employee additional salary so that the cost to the company would be the same. Again there would be no VAT, so it works out at £2,748 plus national insurance at 10.45 per cent., which is an extra £287, less corporation tax relief at 35 per cent.—£1,062—and the cost to the company would be the same, at £1,973, but the employee would have to pay tax of £687 on his extra salary of £2,748, which would leave him with £2,061.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employee may want to lease the same car. I admit that employees would have a choice if they had the extra money and may want to buy a cheaper car, but the comparison should be the same. If the employee leases the car, he will have to pay £2,880 year plus VAT of £432, which is £3,312. The additional resources required would be £3,312 less the after tax payment of £2,061, giving a total of £1,251. The difference would not be £1,251 because under the other scheme the tax was £550.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is following me. One has to take away the £550, the employee's tax due under the company car scheme, from the £1,251. The result is that if the employee has an extra salary or cash allowance, he would be £701 worse off. Value added tax payments will be due on the leasing if that is done by the employee out of his taxed income. They will not be due if that is done by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
company because it can recover the tax. However, there would be an extra cost under the salary scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have a level playing field, which is something that is close to the heart of Conservative Members, we must either reduce the costs on the salary scheme and offer tax concessions, but that would introduce an unlevel playing field with other business expenditure, or increase car scales. Believe it or not, they would have to be increased by £2,200 to £5,004, which is an increase of 127 per cent., for equality of treatment. I am hoping that the hon. Member for Eastwood will now jump up to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend is asleep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is not asleep. I can see that he is paying attention. [Interruption.]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is impossible to hang upon the words of the hon. Gentleman, which I should like to do, although not for much longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to speak louder. We should not accept the amendment. We in the Opposition sympathise with district nurses who may cover 20,000 miles or more a year when carrying out their duties. We sympathise, too, with insurance salesmen who travel many miles in a week. The last thing that they want to do at the weekend is to drive another 200 miles or so on a private trip. Proper consideration must be given to 100 per cent. business users, but the clause does not do that. I urge the Financial Secretary to consider justified business users. He should also think of the perk users who drive 2,501 miles each year. They do not do that by driving to Leeds or Manchester, as everyone knows that it is easier to use the train, but if they have not used up the magic allowance of 2,500 miles, they will travel by car up to the Ml and M6. They must be masochists to do so, but the scales encourage that sort of antisocial behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other problems. The scale charges could be changed so that they reflect the cost for the business user who uses his car for 75 per cent. of the time on business use. That does not happen at present. A topic that is dear to my heart is the business man or woman who is given a £60,000 Rolls-Royce as a company car. He will never pay anthing like the amount that that perk is worth, when the maximum figure in the table is £7,400 of taxable income, presumably at 40 per cent. I have no sympathy for those tax avoidance possibilities that exist in profusion. I hope that the Financial Secretary will support us. We need level playing fields, which we do not have at present, and the hon. Member for Eastwood is trying to make the ground even rougher than it already is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) has relieved me of the burdensome task of analysing in detail the precise effects of the scale of payments, for which I and the Committee are grateful. He has also relieved me of the necessity of deploying the level playing field argument, with which I entirely
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
agree. That allows me to concentrate on the other important reasons why the amendment should not be accepted. The clause does not go far enough, which is why we tabled other amendments that go would wide of the Ways and Means resolution and cannot be taken separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state should not subsidise the car. It is about the most environmentally damaging form of transport. It is ludicrous to pour considerable state subsidy into it. I cannot support the amendment as it would provide for an even higher level of subsidy than the Government propose. All the evidence shows the damage done to the environment by emissions from the motor car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence also shows that, on the whole, company cars tend to be larger than cars that are privately owned by individuals—and they consume more fuel. Add to that the effect of the free petrol that is provided under many arrangements, which positively invites people to use more fuel, and there are grounds for the compelling argument to end the level of subsidy that now exists. Free petrol also encourages employees to use cars when public transport, especially trains, would be a more sensible and environmentally friendly alternative. One car in three is used by commuters to London. We can all see for ourselves the extent of the damage caused to the environment by that amount of car commuting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his 1988 Budget statement the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) said that the typical company car was probably taxed at only a quarter of its full value. He doubled the rate in 1988 and increased it further in 1989. Now his successor has increased it again by 20 per cent. If the right hon. Gentleman's 1988 Budget speech accurately estimated the undervaluation, we are still well below—certainly not beyond 80 per cent.—of the true value to the employee of the car with which he is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise again to the hon. Member for Eastwood that we are discussing the cost on which the employee is taxed. We are not trying to put a charge on the employee beyond his tax liability. We want to tax him or her on the benefit that is received in the same way as other employees are taxed on the benefits that they receive in the form of salaries and other benefits. It would make sense to close the gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further gap to which attention was drawn in an earlier intervention. National insurance contributions are not attracted to the payment that is represented by a company car. That becomes irrelevant when the cut-off point for national insurance contributions is reached, at which time they would not be paid anyway because the employee would be above the level at which national insurance contribution liability arises. Nevertheless, that further demonstrates the extent of the subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government think that they have made an adequate move on the issue of the company car and believe that they can be happy with or even tempted by the amendment, I hope that they will read the reaction of the press to their legislation. On 31 March, an article was published in 
	<i>The Independent</i> under the headline:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Company car is still a perk not to be sneezed at".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
That headline was not misleading. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Britain's two million drivers of company cars can breath again. The Chancellor increased the tax on this most coveted of all company perks by a mere 20 per cent.—well ahead of inflation but considerably less than the doubling of the charge which had been widely expected."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman denying that the Government have increased the tax on company cars by 350 per cent. during the past five years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listed almost all the rates at which the Government increased the tax. They doubled the rate in 1988, increased it by 30 per cent. in 1989 and increased it by a further 20 per cent. this year. Clearly, the Government recognise the problem and, each year, they have increased the tax. But they have still left the company car in the position of being a benefit to the employee unlike any other benefit. It is a perk at a reduced level of taxation, which contributes to the way in which the car is regarded as a status symbol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The company car is an important mark of status within the organisation. The type of car driven reflects an individual's place in the hierarchy; thus, the saying that salesmen drive Sierras while managing directors drive Jaguars. A step up the career ladder often means a bigger and better car."</p></blockquote>
That article was written by a tax manager in Coopers Deloitte and is meant to remind companies of the value of the company car as a means of providing tax exempt remuneration and of the extent to which they can continue that hierarchy and status game at the expense of taxpayers in general and of my constituents, many of whom cannot even afford to run a car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that the position was created in the late 1970s under the Lib-Lab pact, when an artificial ceiling was placed on salaries and, as a result, many employers encouraged people to take their increases in kind rather than in salary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree. If that were so, there would have been a most dramatic reduction in the use of such perks since the rates of income tax were so sharply reduced in the past few years. There is no sign of that, and one of the Government's arguments for reducing income tax was that it would bring an end to the desire to find other forms of paying people that were not subject to tax. Nothing of the kind has happened, and this perk is still an advantage which is enjoyed by some. The tax managers at Coopers Deloitte are happy to recommend it to companies as still being a tax efficient way of remunerating employees.

The Government should resist the amendment and have another look at the company car if they are to take serious account of equity in the tax system and the environmental damage involved in the promotion of cars and, in many cases, much larger cars.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. Member to speak I announce that I will exercise my discretion this evening.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I saw the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), I thought that if we had to sit at this time in the evening it would provide for a good knock-about debate. In some ways, it has turned out to be one, and perhaps the hon. Gentleman tabled it for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This week, I received through the post a nicely produced document from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland which follows the amendment almost word for word; and much of what the hon. Member for Eastwood said in support of the amendment is in it as well. [Hon. Members: "Ah!"] Perhaps he should have declared an interest: he may want to do so now. I do not know, but time will tell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his 1988 Budget speech, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Far and away the most widespread benefit in kind is the company car, which is substantially undertaxed…an employee with a typical company car may be taxed on only about a quarter of its true value."
— [Official Report, 15 March 1988; Vol. 129, c. 1009.] </p></blockquote>
As we have heard from more than one hon. Member this evening, despite the tax having increased in the past three years, there is no sign of any abatement in the number of company cars appearing on the roads. There has been no disincentive to that perk, which the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said one would have expected if it had been introduced merely as a ruse in more difficult economic times in the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disincentive to the company car, and it is very much a perk. Approximately 1.5 million motorists in the country are isolated from the true costs of motoring, and that should not be allowed to continue. The subsidy was topped up by the Chancellor of the Exchequer two years ago and it is far from being eliminated. It has estimated that the loss to the Exchequer is about £2.8 billion a year in forfeited taxation. Were it not that so many of the Government's supporters in the upper income bracket benefit most spectacularly from the practice, more serious efforts would have been made to curb it long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a well established fact that the largest cars are owned by those earning the highest salaries. They benefit most and, in so doing, they deny the Exchequer most. It is also a fact that those who drive the largest cars contribute most to the pollution produced by cars and use more road space, especially in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that Britain tops the league of the number of company cars. On a list of 12 European
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
countries - not only within the EEC - Britain comes top of every category from company directors down to departmental managers. The perk is far more widespread in this country and is already subject to abuse. The amendment of the hon. Member for Eastwood would extend that abuse and his argument in favour of it cannot be taken seriously. If a 10,000 mile cut-off was introduced, the already substantial subsidy to drivers of company cars would increase, and that is indefensible. If the stated aim of the Government in 1988 remains to curb that abuse, they must oppose the amendment. The incentive for people to use company cars is not only, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) stated, to get over the 2,500 mile threshold so as not to have their subsidy reduced, but those approaching the 18,000 mile threshold are encouraged to use a car instead of trains, and that increases road congestion and pollution and produces a greter tax loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham also referred to the so-called classic car tax loophole. A more extreme example than that of the Rolls-Royce is that of the 1920s Bentley which is now worth approximately £150,000. When it was produced in the 1920s, the original market value was approximately £12,000. That is not only a classic car, but a classic example of the abuse to which the current legislation can be and in some cases is put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood is not present to say whether he tabled the amendment with tongue in cheek. He has already taken me by surprise today by informing me that his father was one of the teachers at my school and in view of our political differences now that causes me embarrassment, and may also embarrass the hon. Gentleman.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of your ruling, Mr. Cormack, that there will be no clasue stand part debate on the general subject of charging for taxation a person who uses a car for business purposes, I wish to refer to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary a matter that I rasised earlier- the case of Gurney v. Richards in 1989. That case is worrying and should be sorted out. I should like my hon. Friend to tell the Committee how his mind is working in that direction. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It may surprise Opposition Members that Ministers consider such matters carefully instead of putting out any old policy pamphlet tomorrow. If the Opposition have a policy on the matter, it would be interesting to hear about it on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gurney v. Richards, concerned a fire officer who was required to use his car to travel from home to work. He was called on duty by a telephone call to his home and had to go to the fire station, often having already given advice on the telephone on how to deal with the fire before proceeding to it. His car had a flashing light on top and it would have been illegal for it to have been treated as a private car because only a police car or fire car can have a flashing light on top
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
according to statute. Therefore in fire officer Mr. Richards' case it was impossible for him to regard his car as a private vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local inspector of taxes took him to court because he had persuaded the commissioner of taxes that he was on duty while traveling from his home to his office, just as Dr. Owen- a different and more genuine Dr. Owen—did in the case of Pook v. Owen. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> He was one for whom I had far more sympathy. The two cases were different. If the chief fire officer received a call at home, or wherever he was, he would give his advice, set out for the fire and remain on radio or car telephone contact but Dr. Owen, when he was on call, was not on duty, but if he received a call at home, he would advise on the telephone and set out for the hospital. Can anyone spot the difference? Mr. Justice Millett, the judge, could. He said;
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was an objective necessity arising from the nature of his duties … not a matter of personal choice, that he should carry out his work both at the hospital and at the surgery, (his home)."</p></blockquote>
However, Mr. Richards, the fire officer, might well, according to the judge
	<br><blockquote><p>"be on call at home and might from time to time give advice on the telephone from home"</p></blockquote>
but was required to carry out his work and be available for duty wherever he might happen to be. Accordingly, ruled the judge, while Dr. Owen had two places of work and could be free of tax for journeys between home and his place of work, Mr. Richards had only one place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know, Mr. Cormack, whether you agree, but I see no difference between the two cases. Mr. Richards was required to have a car that was incapable of being used for private use and which he was required to drive because he was on duty all the time and was charged to tax for his journeys to work, and Dr. Owen was not. the whole issue of the charging of travel to work, whether people are employed or self-employed, ought to be resolved to the satisfaction of ordinary mortals who deal with these problems daily and advise people as well as that of the courts and Mr. Justice Millett.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was in industry, managers complained that they did not have a company car although, as we did not leave the factory, we did not need one. However, this was a source of much irritation. My brief notes that four out of five managers who earn in excess of £15,000 are given a car and nine out of 10 who earn more than £17,000 also get a car. That is classed as a perk.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the low level of £8,500 at which the Government begin to tax the so-called perk. The Committee appears to have overlooked it, as I had until I had a visit at my surgery from a district nurse to whom the Government had given a large increase in pay which took her over the £8,500 mark. This lady needs a car for her work. The family already has a car, so this would be the second car. Because she earns more than £8,500 she is being taxed. With pay of £8,500, employers in the public sector do not give cars as a perk. The figure of £8,500 is less than the average wage but the Government have decided that at that salary a car should be taxed as a perk. It is essential that someone who is given a job as a district nurse be given a car to carry out that job. The district nurse was aggrieved because local National Health Service officials forgot to advise her that she would be taxed on the car. The local tax inspector found out about it, and she was taxed at a punitive rate of about 90T, and it was very hard for her to survive that year. Unless we are prepared to see our district nurses and other essential workers getting back on their bikes, we should do something about the very low levels at which tax starts to be levied, because it creates anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all in favour of taxing the perk, but there is something wrong when people are impoverished because of their work and need a second car when there is already a family car. If the Chancellor can do nothing about it now perhaps he can push it up to a reasonable level—perhaps to that of average earnings—in the next Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall be brief. In last year's Finance Bill Committee, Standing Committee G, I made a short speech in which I raised some of the points about which the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders had expressed concern in this connection. I have no declarable interest in the matter, and in the interests of brevity, I merely draw the attention of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to that speech, because what I said on that occasion is still valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise one other point. On the basis of a typical company car and identical average mileage figures, the ordinary employee on schedule E is now taxed more heavily for private use than is his schedule D counterpart. That is particularly true this year, in that we have proposed increases in the scale charges by more than the rate of inflation. Will my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary consider that, and also the points that I raised this time last year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised to hear the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) say that people really value the perk. That sums up the argument of Conservative Members: they value the perk. It is something that they have, but they do not pay tax on it. The people who buy a car for private motoring, pay tax on it, and the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) is right when he says that they value it because they pay tax on it. The people who do not pay the full amount of tax on it, value it too, but they value it in a shameful way, and I am surprised to hear the hon. Member for Esher arguing for the retention of these perks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the Financial Secretary against the special pledgings by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). If he gave way to Mr. Gurney or Mr. Richards it would open a nasty tax avoidance loophope. The chief firefighter may have been on duty all the time but he way working at his home, although he was on duty. The doctor was working at his home while on duty because he was in his surgery, where he spends much of his time. That case was in a different category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
Member for Richmond and Barnes must realise, is that if an exception is made for chief fire officers who are supposed to be on duty, an exception would probably have to be made for solicitors. They might be rung up by their clients in one of Her Majesty's prisons at any time. It is possible for all sorts of employees to have written into their contracts that they must be on duty or available all the time. If they must be available all the time they can claim that they were at home but available. Therefore, they should receive the special exemption and not pay tax as they do at present. That would be a dangerous precedent but I do not believe that the Financial Secretary will allow it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is developing such a non-egalitarian argument. He mentioned the position of solicitors. By analogy with his explanation of the favourable treatment of doctors, if a solicitor claimed that his home was also his place of business, he could claim business use of his car in visiting a client. The firefighter, however, could not. In the case cited by my hon. Friend for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), it appeared that the judgment of the learned judge was based more upon the perception that the doctor was "one of us" and therefore entitled to favourable treatment. The firefighter was "one of them," not of the same social grouping as the judge, and should not therefore have that tax perk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right in the case of solicitors who have books and an office at their residence and do a substantial part of their work there. A chief fire officer who happens to be at home having tea when the bell goes cannot, because he is supposed to be on duty all the time, count that as being at work and say that he is therefore entitled to claim. There is a distinction. If such special treatment were allowed, the door would be opened for the special treatment of all sorts of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) that we are not against motoring or against people using a car. It is a valuable, technical invention and everyone who wants to use one should do so. It must be controlled because there are too many vehicles emitting noxious fumes, and the Opposition insist that when the motor car is given as a perk, that benefit in kind must be properly taxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury(Mr. Peter Lilley) </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is, I think, widespread acceptance that benefits in kind should be properly taxed. The debate has revealed widespread recognition that the car as a benefit in kind has been undertaxed. We decided that it was appropriate this year to raise the scale charges by 20 per cent., on top of the considerable increases in previous years referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). We make that judgment each year in the light of circumstances and by balancing how those and other Budget changes will affect people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Opposition parties are united in believing that the scale charges are about half what they ought to be—or of that order of magnitude. To bring about such a dramatic increase could have a considerable impact
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
not least on their level of standing in the country. Are we to take their proposal as a pledge or is it something that they will do when the time is right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Merek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition did not argue that scales should be increased by 50 per cent. Scale C needs to be increased substantially but there are different arguments for scales A and B. When I first spoke, we were debating the proposal from the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) to reduce the 18,000 limit to 10,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> I shall come to that as well, and I think that we may have more in common at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) particularly mentioned the most expensive cars. As it happens, only 2 per cent. of cars fall into the band of being worth over £29,000. Clearly, we could multiply the bands up further but when such a small number fall into that category we should not devote overmuch attention to it. In recent years we have frozen that level, which is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastgwood (Mr. Stewart) believes that, whatever the total balance between scale charges and the benefit in kind, in the range between £10,000 and £18,000 they are by implication too high and should be reduced. I was not convinced by that argument although I understand that it has support from those who fall into that band.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present structure is simple. The bulk of cars fall in the range of doing between 2,500 and 18,000 miles a year and a scale charge is paid. If they do more than 18,000 miles a discount of 50 per cent. is given. If their mileage is less than 2,500 50 per cent. more is paid. Right or wrong, that is the structure. Roughly, the mid-point of the middle band is around the average business mileage plus or minus a few thousand miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem strange to move the starting point of the exceptional top band to the mid-point. There is no argument for doing that. Logically, if we did that we would reduce the average mileage of the top band and we should therefore reduce the discount. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood is proposing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also see the disadvantage referred to by the hon. Members for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) in terms of environmental losses. If we had a boundary between the single scale and the half scale charge coming nearer to where the bulk of motoring is done that would create an incentive for people to increase their mileage to fall the other side and far more people would be in a position to do it. We should not go out of our way to encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I shall ask my hon. Friend whether he wants to press the amendment and, if he does, recommend that it should not be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes mentioned the Gurney v. Richards case. The court has considered these matters in far more detail than we can here because we are not a Court of Appeal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
and we should not set ourselves up as one. Doctors are a comparatively rare category of people who have two places of work. Another such category is Members of Parliament who work both here and in their constituencies. I urge my hon. Friend to bear that in mind when he considers this matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) mentioned the starting point at which benefit in kind charges begin to bite—£8,500. He will recall that it used to be called the "higher paid" limit, but we cut that wording out as anomalous either the previous year or a year before that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Governments deliberate intent that that limit should not be raised, because it is right in principle to tax benefits in kind on a parallel basis, given practical difficulties, with benefits in cash. We should not create an aritficial incentive for the low paid to be paid in kind. That reminds me of the Truck Acts, which were designed in the 19th century to stop the low paid being paid in kind. It would be anomalous to move in the opposite direction. It is not an oversight, but deliberate policy, which has widespread support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister realise that he is creating another poverty trap? A person who is earning £8,400 a year is not subject to this tax. As soon as he rises above that band—even the Minister should agree that that is not a large salary—he will be worse off. Is that not anomalous? It is not disturbing to hear a Minister say that he understands the situation, yet intends to keep it that way? Inflation will be running at 10 or 15 per cent. next year. The poor, who may be given a car by employers because it is essential, will suffer. That will also have a detrimental effect on community care and will present problems for district nurses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the way to resolve that problem, to the extent that it exists, is to jack up the limit and put the trap to which the hon. Gentleman referred at another level of income. The present position is sensible and I believe that there is much cross-party support for not encouraging benefits in kind rather than cash when there is no objective reason to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned a person who kept a car at home and needed another for work. That suggests two uses for a car. It is not the function of the tax system to assist people to run two cars rather than one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) mentioned his speech of the previous year. I re-read it recently. Although I find my hon. Friend as persuasive and eloquent as ever, the reply of the Paymaster General contained some compelling arguments. In my hon. Friends view, schedule D treatment of benefit in kind is more favourable than schedule E. There is no easy way of comparing the two. It is impossible to arrive at exact parity between them. The schedule D taxpayer may set a share of allowances used on
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
business against his profits; the share used for his private mileage must be assessed as part of his private income. It is difficult to compare that with schedule E. However, I shall consider further the issues that my hon. Friend has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have covered most of the issues that have been raised in the debate. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, but to allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 14, line 3, leave out '£600' and insert '£1,200'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose to increase the permitted amount of money contributed to charity through the payroll giving scheme. They introduced the scheme to encourage regular donations to charity, but it has not generated the substantial sums envisaged. The sums contributed do not compare favourably with the amounts paid by charities in VAT.

	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
There are two ways in which the Government could boost the scheme. They could remove the agency complications so that employees could be more readily identified with the charities to which they wished to contribute, without going round the agency route. Alternatively, they could increase the ceiling—for example, to over £1,000—to encourage donors with considerable income and surpluses to give more regularly. A ceiling of £1,200 would provide a neat, easy and memorable figure of £100 a month for those who could afford it. The Goverment, especially the Prime Minister, believe that people who earn that sort of income will be willing to donate such sums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> A reminder of the existence of the scheme in our pay packets would be useful. The amendment seeks to encourage the Government to consider the payroll giving scheme further. It has not achieved all that they envisaged, but it would do better if the charity was more directly related to the employees, and if the ceiling was raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> I am grateful to the hon. Members for Berwick-upon-Tweed for raising the issue. He supports the scheme and wishes to improve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency system is not a complication. It enables the employer more easily to route a variety of different charitable requests from employees to their many potential destinations. That is essential if we are to get employers into the scheme. I am happy to say that employers and employees are joining the scheme in increasing numbers. Consequently, the amount being given is increasing significantly. There is a threshold at which the scheme will become so universally accepted that everybody will make use of it, as people in other countries do with similar schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of raising the ceilings was raised. If the Committee supports the gift aid proposals, which are yet to be presented, we will have a system for giving. It will include covenants for giving on a regular committed basis with a tax advantage. There will be payroll giving for giving in a regular, but not necessarily long-term, committed way. The gift aid scheme will allow one-off donations which are larger than are permitted under the payroll giving scheme and which are less likely to be regular because of their size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a logical structure and meets the underlying objectives of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) rather better than jerking up the payroll giving limit. There will be a reasonable structure of incentives for giving. I hope that all hon. Members will proselytise on its behalf in their constituencies and take to heart the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) about the answer of my right hon. Friend the Lord President of the Council that so far only 51 hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's points, but he should keep an open mind. Many charities believe that the agency arrangement does not work entirely satisfactorily and want more scope for larger, regular donations.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scheme has not lived up to the great claims that were made for it at its introduction. Despite the comments of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that the lack of uptake has anything to do with the threshold. The Government want to adjust the threshold a little and the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The charities law reform group believes that a figure of £1,200 may attract monthly donations of £100 from a significant number of people, which is why I suggested it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting, new contribution to the debate. The hon.

He mentioned only the opinion of the group advocating that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said that the scheme would eventually cross a threshold to universal acceptance. The Charities Aid Foundation estimates that the scheme attracts about 200 new people each month. At that rate it will be some time before we cross the threshold described by the Financial Secretary.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has tantalised us all with a trailer for the gift aid clauses. Can he tell us precisely what those clauses will contain and when we, the ordinary, humble Members of the Committee can see them? The gift aid clauses, along with the other new clauses promised in the Budget speech, have been much discussed in general, but the specifics have not been put before us. If the Government do not let us see those clauses soon, such is the enthusiasm for progress on both sides of the Committee, demonstrated by a willingness to stay late at night and make sure that these matters have a thorough airing, that the Bill will

be back on the Floor of the House before the Committee has seen these marvellous extra clauses. I am sure that it is not the Financial Secretary's intention to sabotage the Budget of his righ hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee that the clauses are not yet ready. I have reason to hope that they will be ready fairly soon, but I cannot give a precise date, much as I should like to. They may be with us shortly after we are back from our little respite, and I am sure that they will be welcome news to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply hurt and disappointed that I have failed to tantalise the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) as much as her hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). It is a shame to bad mouth a very good and increasingly valuable scheme. It increased its take-up by about a half last year. I cannot do compound arithmethic, but at that rate of growth it will become substantial in a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 4,700 schemes have been set up by employers and more than 180,000 employees participate in them. That compares with 125,000 participants a year or so ago so the take-up is increasing more rapidly than the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East suggested. The £7 million in donations every year might not otherwise be available and certainly not on so regular a basis. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will agree to raising the limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter should not delay us long—I have noticed the changing of the guard. However, it would be remiss if we did not share our concerns about the clause. Broadly, we welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surprising that the Government have taken so long to extend the SAYE scheme to the banks. One wonders whether, if one particular building society had not become a bank, the provision would have been brought before us. It might be better to term this the Abbey National clause. I have no personal interest in the Abbey National, but I believe that it had the third largest share of the market of share option schemes for workers backed up by the SAYE scheme. When it converted from a building society to a bank—one wonders why there has been no rapid onslaught of building societies seeking to follow in its wake—that business disappeared. For its own workers' share option scheme, the Abbey National had the humiliation of going to the Yorkshire building society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
We welcome the Abbey National clause. We have nothing against people having the Abbey habit, but we believe that it is more important to have the saving habit. It is on that that we wish to take the Government to task.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In due course. The hon. Gentleman will have his chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are the ones to be surprised, because Conservative Members, and the Financial Secretary in particular, have at last seen the errors of their ways in their policy on savings. The Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service expressed the pious hope that the measures would be welcomed because they might assist in creating a climate in which poersonal savings, rather than excessive personal borrowing, would become the norm. Opposition Members know who are responsible for that excessive personal borrowing—certain right hon. and hon. Members on the Conservative Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary should not try to avoid his personal responsibility in the matter. Many members of the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service have not forgotten the grand blow-out of 1988 or the Financial Secretary's role as the commis waiter. Let us give Jack his jacket: the Chief Secretary was the commis chef and the present Chancellor was the sous chef. We all know who the maitre d' was: it was the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), who presided over the massive expansion of personal borrowing, which he and Conservative Members fuelled. That is why we are surprised that you should now have discovered the importance of thrift and savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have discovered nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me, Mr. Cormack, to suggest that you are a discoverer, but you will know that the Opposition welcome any measure that will encourage people to be thrifty. However, we cannot help sharing the view of the Select Committee and of Treasury officials who gave evidence that the measure will have only a minor macro-economic effect. The officials conceded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would not necessarily expect to see a very sharp increase in aggregate in saving in the short term as a result of the Budget measures."</p></blockquote>
Yet, having trumpeted the virtues of the Budget as one for savers, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave evidence to the Select Committee he said that it was a "Budget for savers" but not a "Budget for savings". It was the Chancellor who made that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members not their heads in assent. The Chancellor thought that there would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a very strong social impact but a modest macroeconomic effect."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
Modesty in a Conservative Chancellor is a welcome characteristic, although it is not one that we have become used to in the past year. When we look at this Budget we may think that the Chancellor has a lot to be modest about, including the impact of this measure on savings and the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask the Committee to bear in mind that the Government have not given the Department for National Savings any help in creating the climate and culture of thrift that the Chancellor recommended to the nation. The Financial Secretary should think again about giving the Department for National Savings a new and more imaginative role in creating that culture. Time and time again over the past 18 months its role has been undermined. In March 1989, paybill and standing order facilities were withdrawn from the ordinary account. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was obliged to draw the attention of the Financial Secretary to that matter. The forces saving schemes for ordinary accounts were discontinued. The national savings gift tokens and premium bond gift tokens were withdrawn from sale in June last year. Every month some new measure undermined the Department for National Savings and its role and work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Conservative Members reflect on the history of the SAYE scheme they will recall that it was introduced as a result of campaigning activity by the national savings movement of the 1960s. It was possible at that time to speak of a movement to underpin the thrift culture that the Government now say they wish to embrace. Why not have such a movement now, with the Department for National Savings as the means by which it might be introduced? Why was it necessary, in July 1989, to remove the ability to cash income bond interest warrants and national savings registered dividend warrants at post offices? What possible public benefit accrued from that mean little measure? In January this year we objected to the reduction in the maximum holdings in income bonds and investment accounts from £100,000 to £25,000. Unfortunately, the Financial Secretary was not then present in the House, but the Economic Secretary will recall out protest. All those measures served to undermine the Department for National Savings and the role that it might play in promoting and enhancing the thrift culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we shall not divide the Committee on the clause—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> We do not intend to make life any more difficult for the Government than we have to, but it is right to draw attention to the weakness of the Government's strategy over savings. We want—and in the fullness of time we shall have—a Budget for savings and not a Budget for savers. That distinction reveals the hollowness of the Government's commitment to savings. The Financial Secretary must assure the Committee of his continued commitment to the principles that have underpinned the Department for National Savings for many years. The Government should ensure that those principles are implemented with imagination and verve, qualities that were notably lacking in this year's Budget and the administration of the Department over the past 18 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a great deal with which I could agree in what the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) said. He is right that the increasing blurring of the distinction between building socieities and banks and the fact that that boundary can be crossed renders it an omalous to forbid banks to operate save as you earn schemes. That is the reason for this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He is also right to say that all the measures contained in what is a very imaginative Budget for savers will not bring an immediate and massive short-term macro-economic change. However, in the long term, it will contribute to the revival of the culture of thrift, in which we can all rejoice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Department for National Savings is not specifically affected by clause 24, I remind the Committee that the Budget raised the interest on a number of the Department's products by 1 per cent. The Opposition will welcome that as a necessary measure and it demonstrates the continuing importance that we attached to the Department. I am grateful that the amendment is not being pressed and I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 18, line 1, at end insrt—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) the references in section 25(5) above to consideration include a reference to consideration deemed to have been received by the disponor under any provision of the Taxes Acts.".</p></blockquote>
With your assitance, Mr. Cormack, I shall be dealing with the rest of the clauses on behalf of the Opposition. They all concern matters consequent upon clause 25 which we debated on the Floor of the House. We were right to do so because the debate proved a useful vehicle to review progress with the establishment of ESOPs and to reaffirm the all-party consent for the measures in this year's and last year's Finance Bills that establish Finance Act employee share ownership plans, on ESOPs, as opposed to the case law ones that have so far come into being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to explore three relatively detailed points with the Government and the amendment raises the first of them. We are worried about the tax treatment of gifts to an ESOP or shares that are sold below par—at below their real value—into an ESOP. We are worried not so musch about the tax treatment of the ESOP as about the tax treatment of the person who has made that donation. We would want to encourage a majority shareholder or substantial minority shareholder in a concern who, on his retirement, rather than selling his shares on the open market and rolling the money over into some other concern and claiming relief, might want to sell the shares into an ESOP so that the employees of the concern could have the benefit of them in the longer term. We fear that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
would be discouraged from doing so on the basis of selling them at less that the market rate because of the effect on his liability for capital gains tax. Our concern is that the Government have not thought through the issue. I am not certain that our amendment would provide a complete solution to the problem because it does not remove the vendor from tax liability. However, it would be possible for the Government to facilitate a relief in those circumstances through the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 through holdover relief or through an extension of the relief for gifts. We would like the Government to come back with that rather than trying to facilitate it from this side of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that Conservative Members have said contradicts our belief that in the event of somebody wishing to sell shares into an ESOP for social, rather than purely commercial, reasons, the whole House would want to facilitate that. It would not want a person who had done such a thing—whether the shares had been gifted or sold at below value—to be stuck with a capital gains tax bill that would not enable that person to take full advantage of the rollover relief. I suspect that it is not the Government's intention to discourage such people. If the Financial Secretary can say anything to convince me that relief would be available in those circumstances, my point would be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman assurance that, if I understand correctly what he is seeking to achieve, his amendment is unnecessary because it is already achieved by clause 27(5). It is perfectly understandable that he should not have realised that. No ordinary person—at least nobody who was not a great deal cleverer than I—could have realised it because it is impenetrable. The Bill already provides for it and we can all be content that the point has been made clearer than it would otherwise be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have an absolute assurance from the Minister that no one who gifts or sells their shares into an ESOP at below the real cost on which they are assessed for capital gains will not be disadvantaged under capital gains tax legislation, I am satisfied and thank him.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not talk at length about employee share ownership schemes because we did so on the Floor of the House only a few days ago and the Minister knows my commitment to them. The Bill requires the person selling the shares to the ESOP to reinvest the proceeds of sale within six months to be able to claim the relief. The amendment extends that time to four years, commencing 12 months before the sale of the shares and ending three years after the sale. This longer period corresponds to the period allowed for reinvestment in the main existing rollover relief provisions in section 115 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 applies to the same point but goes the other way—it is slightly more restrictive. It makes sense to relax the time limit. It could be argued that investments could be made within six months, especially in equities, but a longer time is needed for investment in business assets such as land or buildings for business purposes, plant and machinery. There is support among those wishing to encourage ESOP schemes for more flexibility on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 37 touches on ground similar to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) but does not follow him all the way. Amendment No. 37 is a probing amendment to seek justification from the Government for relaxation of the treatment in clause 26(3)(b). As I understand it, the maximum relief period, if all the events fell on the right day, would be some 18 months. Amendment No. 48 would extend that period to three years. We do not agree with that and should like to explore with the Government the extension for what I take to be a maximum of 18 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments go in slightly different directions. In response to the amendment put forward by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, I would argue that there is no obvious need for such a long time. The hon. Gentleman quoted the analogy of similar considerations where there is holdover relief, but in those circumstances a longer time is allowed because time may be necessary to identify appropriate business assets in which to reinvest. The relief that we are introducing for ESOPs will not be limited only to business assets. People will quite often reinvest in quoted shares which are relatively easy to identify. The reasons for not having a longer period are practical ones. It is in no one's interest for assessments to be left open for a long time. It creates extra hassle both for taxpayers and the Revenue. As it is an unnecessary extension that creates problems, I hope that we need not extend the time limits, which are perfectly adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) is not desirable. At the extreme, the ESOP may not have a 10 per cent. stake until more than six months after the disposal, and at the six-month point the taxpayer will not know whether the conditions for the relief have been met. In those circumstances it seems right to give him an opportunity to being himself within the relief after the 10 per cent. condition has been met. The amendment would deny
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
that right. We do not want to make it artificially difficult for him to take advantage of relief, and I am sure that the Opposition do not want that either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seemed to take my point and use it against me. I accepted that it would be relatively simple to reinvest in equities, but much less simple to reinvest in business equipment. There might be good reasons for someone choosing to do that. As we seem to run an annual seminar on ESOPs, I am prepared to carry this over to the next stage of the exercise, but I remind the Minister that we want to get these measures off the ground, and that argues for more openness to modifications such as was shown when the matter was discussed on the Floor of the House.

Since we tabled our amendment, the Government tabled new clause 14, which would block up the housing tax loophole, and new clause 15, which would block up the BES loophole.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of these amendments is to explore with the Government matters that were first raised on the Floor of the House. I express my nervousness that by drafting the legislation to encompass any chargeable event, regardless of how small it is, in relation to the establishment of the ESOP it will mean either that total relief will be denied at the outset or that it will be totally withdrawn. The Financial Secretary has confirmed that that is the Government's intention. That is dangerous. There will be a duty of care on the trustees, many of whom are volunteers working for no great remuneration or reward. They could be in difficulty and could make themselves liable because of the way that the legislation is drafted, regardless of how small the chargeable event is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the measure would deter gifts. It will deter the very people whom we are seeking to encourage. People departing from the running of their small business will ask why they should risk losing the relief on the occasion of some small chargeable event. They will wonder whether it would be less risky to sell the shares on the stock exchange instead. I am sure that it is not the Minister's intention to discourage people in this way, but that is the direction in which he is going. The clause is ridiculously wide. Some small allowance should be facilitated, which is the purpose of our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, as the amendments are drafted they seem to conflate the relief from corporation tax which we introduced last year with the relief from capital gains tax or roll-over relief that we are introducing this year. The effect could be to open
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
up avoiance opportunities and deprive people of the relief to which they are entitled. I know that the hon. Gentleman does not intend that and I hope that he will, therefore, withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is neither my intention to open up avoidance opportunities nor to deprive people of relief to which they are properly entitled. Nevertheless, I hold to my point abou the need for a mechanism to deal with small chargeable events. I hope that the Financial Secretary will feel able, perhaps in next year's Finance Bull, to return to that issue with a small facilitating clause.
