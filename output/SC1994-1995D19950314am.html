	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome all hon. Members to this sitting of the Committee. It is a lovely day and the weekend was super. Macclesfield Town football club won yet again and is now 21 points ahead in the GM Vauxhall conference. Macclesfield's rugby union team defeated Sale in the semi-final of the Cheshire cup.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>VAT—FIRST VISITS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>"1. The following section shall be inserted after section 10 of Schedule 1 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994—
	<br><blockquote><p>10A. The Commissioner shall ensure that all persons registered under this Act shall receive an inspection visit from an officer of HM Customs and Excise for the purposes of education and verification within three years of the effective date of registration.".—[
	<i>Ms Primarolo.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed [9 March],</i> That the clause be read a Second time.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Winterton. We on the Conservative Benches are all feeling pretty chirpy because the finishing post is in sight sometime this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my pleasure to resist new clause 3. The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) advanced her arguments at the last sitting and I have the record of that to refresh my memory. She started by criticising the fundamental expenditure review that the Government have undertaken in respect of Customs and Excise. I assure her that it was not a cost-cutting exercise; it was a recognition that the Government owe a duty to the public to scrutinise public bodies and to subject them to disciplines in the absence of the commercial and competitive disciplines that normally apply in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review bore out our belief that Customs and Excise can maintain—indeed, improve—its output, even with fewer staff. A staff reduction programme will take place over the next five years, although certain departments within Customs and Excise will have their staff increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review also found that a disproportionate amount of audit resource was being devoted to very small VAT-registered businesses and recommended replacing the commitment to a visit within three years of registration for new businesses with an alternative, risk-oriented programme, underpinned by improved education,
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
information and support services for newly registered businesses. Audit visits will continue to be made to traders that are identified as non-compliant, thus protecting revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the point that the Minister has just made. Will he explain why the 85th report of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise for the year ending 31 March 1994 identified as a key area the need:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To visit, according to risk, all newly-registered traders within three years"?</p></blockquote>
The report identified revenue as the reason for doing that. It said that Customs and Excise had not achieved that and that greater effort had to be made because revenue was not being collected. That does not square with what the Minister is now saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes it does. I am pointing out that a disproportionate amount of resource is devoted to very small traders, from which small amounts of revenue are collected; therefore, small amounts of revenue are at risk. I shall shortly come to the effort that we are and will be putting into an alternative approach to the same problem, but the hon. Lady's insistence on an audit visit taking place within the first three years ignores the fact that many traders registering for VAT already have experience of that tax from previous registrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frequently, a trader with an existing business registers a new one or re-registers an old one. It is estimated that up to one third of all new registrations fall into that category. Clearly, they do not require the same attention and frequency of visits as do new business men and traders registering for the first time, who have no experience of the tax. The Opposition's new clause does not take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of a rigid and mechanical visit programme, which may be inappropriate for many businesses, we are developing an alternative educational menu, which will be available to newly registered businesses from 1 April. It will include an invitation to attend seminars specifically aimed at the appropriate category of business or ethnic group—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can almost hear the conversation of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) better than I can hear the Minister's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will speak louder, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding must not speak so much while the Minister is on his feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The second option available to traders will be an appointment to attend a tax surgery, either at the local VAT office or, in rural areas that may not be near to such an office, at a local venue convenient to the trader. Alternatively, an open evening can be held for a group of traders to discuss general questions of VAT registration and compliance. Telephone inquiry points are being set up and videos are being prepared, both to introduce traders to VAT and to address specific concerns of traders such as charities, educational establishments,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
retailers, importers and exporters. Finally, a visit may still be appropriate for many businesses, especially if it is requested, and in any case in which there may be a threat to the revenue from non-compliance or because a trader falls into a high risk category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another further development in providing information to businesses is that Customs and Excise will work more closely with the Inland Revenue to pilot projects such as a shared, low-cost telephone helpline. The emphasis throughout is on helping businesses and, in particular, assisting them with the complexities of the tax so that they comply with VAT regulations from registration. Instead of having to wait for up to three years for a visit, as the Opposition's new clause provides, this menu of options and assistance will be available right from the start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When did the Government decide to abandon their commitment in the charter issued by Customs and Excise that a visit would be made to all new traders within three years? The Minister seems to be arguing against that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The charter will cover the responsiveness and quality of the services that I have outlined, but I must tell the Opposition that the world has moved on from the days when tax authorities adopted a confrontational attitude to the taxpayer. Indeed, in many cases, traders and business men regard visits from VAT officers not so much as a form of assistance, but as an audit. Visiting VAT officers are seen to be more interested in ferreting out underpayments than in trying to assist the trader to comply. Of course, a visit will be required if a trader is suspected of non-compliance or is identified as being a risk. However, we shall not start with the assumption that a visit is the only way to get a trader to comply; instead, we are developing the theme of encouraging assistance for the businesses that will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, therefore, the Opposition's new clause is old-fashioned—it is similar to Labour's old clause IV. She must update her ideas on the matter because a great deal has happened during the past 15 or 16 years. Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have developed new relationships with the trading community, based on helping traders with compliance, rather than on confrontation. I therefore invite the Committee to reject new clause 3 because a range of options is available to traders to do the job better and quicker and at a lower cost to the taxpaying public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that a week is a very short time in politics, although a day seems to be a long time at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not addressed the point of the new clause. The Government have issued charters and they have made a specific charter pledge about VAT. However, they have inadvertently found that their rush to cut staff numbers in Customs and Excise has cut across their charter pledge, although the Minister has not admitted that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reports of Customs and Excise over several years have discussed the best way to ensure compliance and the provision of help to traders in the running of their businesses and their accounting procedures. That help should be a support for business and for the tax base by
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
ensuring that moneys are collected. The Customs and Excise report for 1993 discusses key areas that need to be dealt with, including the single market, service to the public, VAT and proper management. That report stated that one key aim was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To deploy visiting resources to maximise trader compliance and secure £200,000m in additional liability, including underdeclarations disclosed voluntarily by traders."</p></blockquote>
The report went on to say that that goal was not achieved in 1993, but it said that more attention would be paid to the matter. There was a substantial shortfall between what should have been collected and what was collected. With regard to VAT control visiting, the report said that Customs and Excise had a commitment to
	<br><blockquote><p>"visit all newly registered traders".</p></blockquote>
That point was echoed in the 1994 report and it is detailed in the management plans of Customs and Excise for 1995–96. However, the Minister would have us believe that that matter is old-fashioned, old hat, inappropriate and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has not been in Government for a long time—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we can build on this cross-party support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So do I, Mr. Winterton, because the second half of my sentence is that we intend to be in Government soon. Cheering a sentence before it is completed is always risky—I have learnt that much in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incredible that the main plank of the Government's drive for democracy and accountability in opening up Whitehall—the charter system in which charters are issued to specify obligations of Departments—can be treated in such a cavalier fashion by the Minister. In line with Labour's new clause IV, this new clause 3 has taken a Government promise with which we agree and attempted to put it into action. The Minister should explain—he has not done so—why the Government have changed their mind and when was it when we tabled new clause 3? What evidence is available to the Committee and to the Minister to substantiate a change of mind? If he cannot produce that information, we would be right to press it to a vote because it is about protecting revenue into the Treasury and supporting business, as the Federation of Small Businesses has made clear. It is also in line with a recommendation from the Public Accounts Committee, the guardian that checks that Departments act properly. Quite simply, it makes sense. Again I ask the Minister either to assure the Committee or to recommend that it supports new clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to repeat myself, but the hon. Lady did not respond to my point that up to a third of new traders have good experience of VAT because they have been in business before or they have other registered businesses. In such cases, the visit required by the new clause might be a nuisance. New traders do not want to be pestered by VAT officers visiting their premises at times that suit Customs and Excise when they either have all the help that they need or it is available through other means. I listed other ways in which information could be obtained that would be specific to the appropriate trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
The general point is that the citizens charter does not freeze the entire system so that it cannot be changed. The fundamental expenditure review is improving matters by showing that we can find better ways of achieving the same result. In many cases a mechanical and routine visit, according to a predetermined timetable, might not be appropriate. We are able to move on and introduce a better system. That is very much in line with our underlying philosophy in which the taxpayer and the tax gatherer work together to ensure compliance without putting revenue at risk. Many new traders will still be visited, especially when they are identified as being a risk or potentially non-compliant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RATE OF POOL BETTING DUTY</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>"(1) In section 7(1) of the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981 (amount of pool betting duty) for '37.50 per cent.' there shall be substituted '32.50 per cent.'.</p>

	<i>Lady O. Maitland.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause presses the case that pool betting duty of 37.5 per cent. should be reduced to 32.5 per cent. The new clause is not contentious and I hope that it will have the support of both sides of the Committee. It is a probing clause and I do not intend to press it to a Division. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to explain it privately to my hon. Friend the Paymaster General and I now want to explain to the Committee why it is essential to have an even playing field with equal taxation for the national lottery and the pools promoters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The football pools companies are suffering a crisis, having been hit by the extraordinary success of the national lottery. The Committee may have seen the report in the 
	<i>Daily Express</i> last Friday under the headline:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Vernons is a £100m loser on Lottery."</p></blockquote>
It quoted Vernons reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"unfair competition from the National Lottery."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
Last Sunday 
	<i>The Sunday Times</i> printed an article with a halcyon picture of couple sitting on a paradise beach. The caption stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sun shines on the winners: but the outlook for the £900m pools industry is anything but bright".</p></blockquote>
The headline stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pools' days may be numbered as lottery has a ball".</p></blockquote>
I shall not set out all the details from 
	<i>The Sunday Times</i> article, but it stated that City analysts estimate that there is a danger that one or even two pools promoters could go under as a result of the pressure from the national lottery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I set out exactly why matters have reached such a crisis. We have to bear in mind the spectacular success of the national lottery—way beyond our wildest dreams. Lottery sales for this year alone are estimated at almost £4 billion, which is almost two and a half times more than the original sales estimate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a result of the outstanding success of the lottery to which my hon. Friend has referred, how much will be raised for good causes compared with the amount raised by the pools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I shall come to that important point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those additional sales bring additional tax revenue for the Government—£266 million more than projected for 1995. The amendment to reduce the betting duty on the pools would cost the Government £40.3 million at most, so the lottery produces more than enough revenue to cover the gap. To answer my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), the lottery will generate £1.1 billion for charity in 1995, giving £220 million to each of the five good causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to bear with me while I give the lottery statistics from November 1994, when it started, to 31 January 1995. Lottery sales totalled £620 million, tax revenue £70 million and Camelot's profit £30 million. Scratch cards are to be introduced later this month—a move tipped to generate an extra £1 billion in revenue. A mid-week draw is also to be introduced and about 15,000 more terminals will be set up to sell tickets. All of that will put tremendous pressure on the pools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The severe impact on the pools makes me think of what was said when I sat on the Committee on the National Lottery Etc. Bill. We were assured that the lottery would not harm the pools. The Government claimed in their official statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is certainly not our intention to harm the pools and we strongly believe that the pools and lottery can co-exist."</p></blockquote>
The then Minister of State at the Home Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Sir P. Lloyd) acknowledged in the Chamber the then conflicting evidence on the likely effect of a national lottery on the pools industry, which he said
	<br><blockquote><p>"illustrates the need for a careful examination of the issues. We should not just brush aside their concerns… We need to study the evidence carefully and to give those directly affected the chance to put not only their views, but also the evidence on which they base their views."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 January 1992; Vol. 201, c. 1266–7.]</p></blockquote>
There is plenty of evidence that, due to the uneven playing field, pools companies have been hit very hard, as they can confirm.

In 1993, before the national lottery had been established, football pools donated millions of pounds to charity, as well as helping football teams raise money for soccer. The pools contributed £65.4 million to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. A further £35.6 million went to the Football Trust to assist all levels of football. It should be emphasised that the Football Trust, in particular, goes out of its way to help the game at grassroot level, which does not normally excite big donations. Royalty payments of £9.3 million went to the football authorities and £326.7 million went to the Exchequer from pool betting duty. Due to the spectacular success of the national lottery, however, those amounts are seriously at risk. We could end up with a situation where one good cause has simply obliterated a smaller, existing one with a proven track record.

There is no evidence that the national lottery will fund all the losses that it has caused charities that have depended so much on the pools. It is evidence of the downturn that since the national lottery began to function in early November, the effect on the pools companies has been drastic. Zetters, the smallest pools company with 3 per cent. of the market, has reported that turnover is down by 10 per cent. It has been forced to initiate a massive restructuring and an intensive cost-cutting programme in order to stay afloat. Today I spoke to its chairman, Paul Zetter, who admitted that in the past couple of months figures are slightly up, but said that he felt that that increase fudged the issue because, had it not been for the national lottery, his profits would have been infinitely greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vernons, the second largest pools company, has experienced a 15 per cent. fall in revenue and, as a result, has had to make 95 workers redundant—a reduction of one sixth of its work force. In addition, it has had to slash its charitable donations. While it used to give an additional 5p of every 105p stake to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, now it can give only the 2.5 per cent. tax element that it is required to give, all because of competition from the national lottery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the effects of the national lottery have led to an end to large donations from the foundation for projects such as building sports pavillions, leaving only small donations to keep the little charities going, such as the sponsoring of a youth concert, which does not require too much money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994, before the national lottery began operating, Vernons contribution was worth £8.2 million. Littlewoods, by far the largest pools company with 77 per cent. of the market, has also suffered a 10 per cent. loss in the 14 weeks since the lottery began. It has cut 560 jobs among its 4,000 workers. An insider at the company claimed that the lottery could easily
	<br><blockquote><p>"finish the pools if drastic steps are not taken".</p></blockquote>
As a net result, everyone suffers. The increased numbers out of work means a drain on national resources through social security payments. Those people are not entitled to payments from the national lottery. In addition, the good causes that were supported by the pools lose out seriously. Less money is available to help charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
The Football Trust is receiving much less money to continue its work in upgrading fields. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations has estimated that charities will receive about £36 million less this year due to the lottery. The Foundation for Sport and the Arts is down £8.2 million due to lost contributions from Vernons alone, to say nothing of what it will lose from other companies. Normally, the foundation receives 2.5 per cent. of all revenues—a total of £65 million in 1993. All that money has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An eerie precedent is set by Ireland. When it began its state lottery in 1987, more than 80 per cent. of its charities reported diminished income. The pools industry has clearly suffered greatly in the short time since the lottery was invoked. One reason among many why the pools companies have been doing so poorly is that there are serious inequities in the laws that regulate the two industries. I shall not take up the Committee's time by dealing with aspects that are irrelevant to the Finance Bill; instead, I shall concentrate on the importance of examining taxation inequities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of taxation is the crux of the new clause and reason for the unfairness between the two industries. The discrepancies in taxation and contributions to good causes are significant. The pools pay betting duty at 37.5 per cent. whereas the lottery is taxed at 12 per cent. Pools are also forced to donate 8 per cent. of their earnings to charity, while the lottery gives 28 per cent. to good causes. The national lottery's total outtake is 40 per cent., 5 per cent. less than that of the pools, which is 45.5 per cent. The new clause would rectify the inequality by lowering the taxation on pools to 32.5 per cent. That would make the outtake between the two competing interests the same. Alternatively, the figure could be raised to 37.5 per cent., provided that that is paid by both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider why the pools would benefit from a level playing field and fairness, which the Committee will agree is important. Because the lottery has been so successful, it has produced an extra revenue that would cover six times over a 5 per cent. reduction in betting duty for the pools. Although the lottery gives more money to good causes, that money is spread over a large area, which reduces its effect. The pools companies' donation to charity is deeply entrenched in football. When the companies suffer, the sport does too—something for which the lottery cannot make up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that the lottery is primarily philanthropic but that the pools are run for commercial reasons—profit—does not hold water. Camelot makes a higher percentage of profit than the pools companies do, which may make it seem more profit-oriented. The pools and the lottery are both run for good causes—28 per cent. of the lottery's earnings is given to good causes and more than 5 per cent. becomes profit: 8 per cent. of the pools companies' earnings is given to good causes and less than 3 per cent. is profit. The lottery and the pools both donate more money to good causes than they keep in profit. However, Camelot earns more in profits—in percentage of sales and in pounds—than the entire pools industry. It is doubtful whether Camelot is any less commercial than the pools companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pools cannot give any more money than they already do to good causes. The lottery can give a higher percentage to charity because of the 25.5 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
difference in betting duty from the pools. In 1990 and 1991, when the betting duty on pools was reduced by 2.5 per cent., the extra money was rerouted not to profit, but to charitable organisations such as the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and the Football Trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the pools cannot give as much money to charities as the lottery can the pools money is not as widely dispersed as that from the lottery. The organisations to which the pools can give—primarily football—are greatly dependent on that money. Those organisations have already suffered a large drop in pools funding because of competition from the lottery. In 1995, the Football Trust will receive half the amount of contributions that it received in 1994. That will severely affect the grassroots level of the game and the progress in providing ground safety and refurbishments to ageing fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vernons has withdrawn its clients contribution to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and, unless betting duty is reduced, Littlewoods will be forced to do the same, probably in August. Plans to restructure the Football Trust to cover ground safety for other sports—cricket, rugby and non-league football—have been halted, as the pools companies, suffering huge losses, can no longer afford to consider the matter unless there is a significant reduction in betting duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More would be gained by reducing the burden of taxation on the pools to the same level as that on the lottery. There would be not only a level playing field but, if the lottery and pools are permitted to compete on even terms, a chance that the pools would flourish. The pools have never been—and are unlikely to be—a threat to the lottery. All the pools companies want is fairness in an activity in which they have a genuine competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in no one's interest to have a flagging pools industry. The drain on national resources includes paying social security for lost jobs, as well as the loss of money for good causes, which might not be compensated for by the lottery. Of course, the lottery might consider making up the lost benefit by donating the difference to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts so that causes do not lose out. But that is probably not a realistic prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if my hon. Friend the Paymaster General would say that he is keeping the pools problem under review. It would also be helpful if he were to compensate in the forthcoming Budget for the difficulties faced by pools companies. I remind him that both the then Secretary of State for National Heritage, my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) and the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), said in the Committee on the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 that it was not their intention to harm the pools. They believed that the pools and the lottery could co-exist. It is in all our interests to ensure that that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the speech of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
Olga Maitland) with interest also and with admiration for her arguments. She presented a very persuasive case to gain the bipartisan support that she said she was keen to secure. I am sure that she will gain the support of Opposition Members. I hope that such support is matched by that of Conservative Members. Indeed, so convincing was her speech, I hope that she will have convinced herself to press the motion to a Division. That would be the most effective way to persuade the Government to bring about the changes that the hon. Lady wants. The Committee has the power to vary the rate of duty. We could do so here and now; we do not have to wait for further behind-the-scenes—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] So convinced are the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) and his hon. Friends by the arguments so persuasively put by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that they will agree with the Opposition and settle the matter today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat all the arguments adduced by the hon. Lady. She referred to statements that were made by Ministers in the Committee on the Finance (No. 2) Bill 1992, when the regime that was likely to operate under the lottery was debated. The then Paymaster General, the right hon. Member for Northavon (Sir J. Cope), said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The pools play a part in British life that will continue. The ways in which their position has been made easier by the changes in the National Lottery etc. Bill will help them to compete with the national lottery."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 29 June 1993; 
	<i>c.</i> 608.]</p></blockquote>
He was upbeat about the prospects for the pools—but, as the hon. Lady said, experience has shown that the competitive position of the pools has fallen some way short of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the briefing circulated to the Committee by Littlewoods makes clear, several of the changes that it was anticipated would assist the pools have brought little benefit. It would have been disastrous if the distribution of pools coupons by shops had not been legalised, but it was introduced after the national lottery had already made use of the best shops and locations and, consequently, the number of coupons distributed by shops has fallen since the start of the national lottery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of the introduction of the roll-over facility, which it was hoped would establish a level playing field with the lottery. According to Littlewoods, it has been triggered on a couple of occasions, but it has not proved popular with pools punters and has done nothing to improve the market share situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction in the minimum age for pools betting from 18 to 16, which the pools companies had not sought, has been of only marginal benefit. The sort of changes that might help pools companies to achieve a level playing field, such as advertising on television and radio, have not yet taken effect, and the one programme that pools companies believe it would be in their interests to sponsor—the football results, logically—has been specifically denied them. Although the opportunity to collect small pools winnings in betting offices has been of some small benefit, it does not match the potentially more beneficial opportunity to collect small winnings in shops, which the lottery is able to offer. There is a powerful argument that the changes have been insufficient to safeguard a fair competitive position for the pools and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
have not established the level playing field that was hoped for by hon. Members on both sides of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1993, the then Paymaster General gave a commitment that those matters would be kept under review. He referred to the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont), and drew attention to the fact that he said in his Budget speech that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we shall keep the matter under review as the lottery gets going".—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 29 June 1993; 
	<i>c.</i> 608.]</p></blockquote>
What form of continuing review is under way and what conclusions are the Government drawing from it? It seems to me that the only conclusion that one can draw from the experience of the pools since the introduction of the national lottery is that drastic action is necessary if the pools industry, or at least one or two firms, are not to go under. As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said, that would have serious consequences for the causes to which pools companies donate money, in particular for the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. Vernons has already announced its withdrawal of the 5p in the 105p stake. Littlewoods has said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unless there is a sustained improvement in the pools business (or an alleviation in the rate of pool betting duty) Littlewoods will have no choice but to withdraw its funding from the Foundation later in this year (perhaps in August)."</p></blockquote>
That would be very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge what the hon. Lady said about Zetters—that although it had been experiencing a loss, the position in recent months might have stabilised. However, it has only 2 per cent. of the total market; the situation confronting Littlewoods and Vernons, the principal operators, is much more serious. The fall in the weekly stake is 15 to 20 per cent. and, if anything, the trend is downwards. That means that the longer the national lottery operates, the more business those companies will lose. As the hon. Lady pointed out, that is the position before the impact of further innovations by the lottery, such as more frequent draws, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the effect on jobs, 95 have already been lost at Vernons and a few more have been lost since then. At Littlewoods, 560 full-time equivalent jobs have gone since the introduction of the lottery. In fairness to Littlewoods, I should point out that it would say that some of those jobs would have gone anyway, following improvements in the application of technology and the rationalisation of operations. However, no one could believe that a large number of those job losses have not resulted from a severe loss of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important aspect is where the jobs are being lost. It is in places such as Merseyside, Glasgow and Cardiff—already areas of high unemployment. It will be difficult for those who have been made redundant to find new work to compensate. When talking about level playing fields and fair competition, we do not mean just desirable economic theory, but something that has real and serious consequences on the lives of people and the communities in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will not withdraw her new clause; indeed, I hope that she will press it to a vote. The unequal treatment between the lottery and the pools threatens to kill the pools industry and to damage the good causes that it supports. Opposition Members believe that the Government should
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
take action now. Indeed, the hon. Lady's proposed reduction of the duty by 5 per cent. to 32.5 per cent. is, if anything, a modest response to the challenge confronting the pools industry. We have tabled new clause 40, which proposes a 9 per cent. reduction to 28.5 per cent.—a figure that the industry believes would bring about a more level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not take issue with the hon. Lady about the exact percentage of the reduction—an unanswerable case has been made for one. I welcome her commitment to fairness—to which she referred in her speech—so, in all fairness, she should press her new clause to a vote. She can count on our support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam has tabled a probing amendment, because in so doing she has raised one or two important issues that I hope my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Treasury Bench may be prepared to consider in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the chairman of the Conservative Back Bench sports committee, my concerns about the matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam directly relate to the loss of funding for the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and to the potential further damage that sporting bodies may suffer if the matter is not addressed. I refer in particular to the support provided by the Foundation for Sport and the Arts—so ably led by its chairman, Sir Timothy Rice, its deputy chairman, Lord Brabazon of Tara, and its secretary, Mr. Grattan Endicott. The foundation has done tremendously good work in supporting sporting facilities in my constituency and in constituencies across the country. I hope that its work will be able to continue. I shall not repeat the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, but there are clearly issues that should be carefully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to an issue relating to an important club in my constituency, Blackpool football club—which, happily, is doing almost as well as Macclesfield Town this season—which is on the verge of the play-off places in division two of the Endsleigh league.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, I received a letter from its commercial director, Mr. Geoff Warburton, pointing out that since the national lottery was introduced—I fully support the good work done by the lottery—the income derived from Blackpool football club's own lottery had decreased by no less than £2,750 each week. Mr. Warburton believes that that local lottery will probably be even more severely damaged, or even go out of business, when scratch cards are introduced later this month under the national lottery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support some of the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam and hope that my hon Friends on the Treasury Bench will be able to take account of the fact that it is crucial for the Foundation for Sport and the Arts to be able to continue its excellent work. Perhaps my hon. Friends will be able to address some of those matters in a future Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
As I listened to the debate, two matters bothered me. Although many hon. Members have cited a significant amount of evidence that the pools companies are facing a crisis, I detect that there is support, especially on Conservative Benches, for further procrastination and delay. I want to underline how important it is that that does not happen. The new clause should be put to the vote, otherwise the Committee will be open to the accusation that it is posturing on a serious issue, although I am not criticising any hon. Member for doing that. Members of the Committee do not disagree on how serious the matter is—"crisis" is the word that has been used to describe the situation facing the pools companies, and I subscribe to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is self-evident that if new clauses are tabled on such serious issues, it must be right for us to urge hon. Members, in this case the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, to press them to a vote. I hope that the hon. Lady will reconsider her statement that she does not intend to do that because the crisis demands that it should be done. The pools companies and people who have lost their jobs or think that their jobs are under further threat will not understand if we do not vote on this important new clause. There appears to be a lack of urgency emanating from the Government Benches. We must look to the Paymaster General to act with urgency and to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to press the new clause to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted the surprise shown by Conservative Members at the position faced by the pools companies. Why are they so surprised? Hon. Members will remember that when the establishment of the national lottery was debated—particularly how its taxation elements compared with those of the pools—the Government were adamant that it was wrong to make any comparison between the pools and the lottery. Why? The pools was a game of skill whereas the lottery was a gamble, so the two could not be equated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the warnings and predictions made at that stage, which have now been proved correct with serious effects, the Government were adamant about establishing a regime that discriminated heavily against the pools. There is a hollow ring to the surprise expressed by Conservative Members at the current position and the need, dealt with in new clause 6, to take action to reduce betting duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly interested in the comments made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and others to the effect that pools companies face a problem caused by the staggering success of the lottery. It would be foolish to deny that that is true to a substantial extent. Many local shops have a terminal on the counter for all to see and the queues form at about 6 o'clock. However, it would be entirely wrong to swallow whole the argument that pools companies face a crisis simply because of the lottery's success. That is true in part, but we must take account of the discrimination inherent in the legislation, which the Government deliberately put on the statute book for one reason only. They were not bothered about the pools companies, about loss of jobs or about the discrimination in the tax regime, they were interested only in making sure that the lottery was a success. It is as simple as that and today's debate shows it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
I understand that the forecasts made by Littlewoods pools for lottery sales of approximately £1.7 billion in 1995 and £2.5 billion in 1996 are considerable underestimates. Lottery sales in 1995 are likely to be approximately £3.9 billion and considerably more than that in the ensuing years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily concede that the lottery has been a success, but we must not forget about the discrimination that still exists. As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East has said, the reluctant concessions that the Government have made over the past few months and those that they are considering making are welcome, but they do not resolve the basic problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That unexpected and underestimated success demands that the Exchequer should give immediate and urgent consideration to reducing the duty payable. We would like a greater reduction than that proposed in the new clause because the Labour party is a tax-cutting party—[
	<i>Laughter.</i>] Or so I am told. That therefore fits in with our ideology, in spite of propaganda to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that, as Conservative Members have said, the pools companies are facing a crisis. The success of the lottery—and its underestimated success, which is reflected in the figures that Littlewoods has advanced, and which no one seriously challenges—should be used to reduce some of the damage and to create a more level playing field with regard to tax. The Paymaster General should consider that matter seriously and urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to press the case for the Government to take action urgently over another matter. What does "in due course" mean? The hon. Member for Blackpool, South did not see that as an important matter. I do not know what the phrase means: it could mean this month, next month, sometime or never. Action should be taken quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government openly and unashamedly discriminated against the pools companies to make the lottery a success. They therefore have a responsibility—I was about to say a duty—not to prevaricate but to say that action will be taken quickly. I therefore support the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam—perhaps that seems rather surprising—and I should do so more strongly if she has the courage to press her new clause to a vote. I am sure that she has that courage. We should avoid the accusation of posturing over this serious matter. The Government are proud of the lottery's success; they should use that success to re-draw the rules—especially those relating to taxation—to give the pools companies a fighting chance in the future, not only to survive, but to prosper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We hope that the new statement of aims by the Labour party, which has so infected—or perhaps I should say affected—the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probing and posturing were discussed earlier. An issue of probity is involved: when a new clause is tabled, one should, as it were, put one's vote—and the jobs of pools employees and the hopes of the pools industry—where one's mouth is. The new clause provides an acid test for the Committee's ability to change slightly and positively the law as it affects revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally you, Mr. Winterton, will be delighted that Macclesfield Town won on Saturday. Rotherham United only drew—but it drew away, which is always an honourable result. I do not know the current financial position of Macclesfield Town Mr. Winterton but, despite the best efforts of local businessmen, the council and the local community, Rotherham United faces constant problems when trying to keep its head above water financially. The national lottery's impact on income not only from the pools, but from local lotteries, is damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Blackpool, South, I have been in touch with the commercial manager of Rotherham United, who appeals for further backing, both for the pools—the new clause would provide that backing—and local lotteries to help football clubs in general. He, like the commercial manager of Blackpool United—to whom the hon. Member for Blackpool, South referred—is concerned that, with the introduction of scratch cards, there is an absence of a level playing field between the national lottery and the pools and local lotteries. Local lotteries cannot have roll-over prizes and super jackpots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have kindly allowed us to stray a little from the wording of the new clause, Mr. Winterton, so that we can examine how the national lottery works. That subject may be for another debate: however, there is evidence that the lottery is having a damaging effect on the pools industry, its employees' future and the local lotteries and mini-pools, which football clubs in particular run to try to maintain their vital role as cohesive elements in every small town, be it Macclesfield, Blackpool or Rotherham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam could have been delivered by any Labour member of the Committee. I hope that she will put the new clause to the vote and will not take the easy way out by leaving the future of the pools industry as something to be gambled on again in next year's Bill. She will be warmly welcomed by pools workers and at the football grounds of Rotherham United and Blackpool United, and she will find that when she speaks along Labour lines after the adoption of new clause IV, she speaks for the entire nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
As the hon. Lady said, we face a crisis, with imminent decisions expected by other pools companies. Vernons has already announced a reduction in its contribution to the Football Trust to take effect from April this year and Littlewoods is considering a reduction in its contribution to the trust from its spot the ball competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some time, the Football Trust has had a programme for bringing grounds up to the required standards following various disasters, notably the one in Bradford. The Football Trust's contribution to the development of football at grassroots level is also important. Several non-league clubs, Macclesfield Town included, want to achieve Football League status. They have to apply to the Football Trust and the Football League to have their grounds up to standard. The procedure is long and complicated and the deadlines have to be met in the previous season. Macclesfield Town's ground had to be brought up to standard by December 1994 for the club to be admitted to the Football League next season, should it be successful enough in the GM Vauxhall conference this season to be able to apply.

The pools companies have put a great deal of work into the Football Trust. The national lottery has contributed money to its five good causes, but it does not have the closeness that the football pools have to the football industry. Some of my hon. Friends have mentioned lotteries run by football clubs. My own club, Bradford City, has cancelled its lottery because of the impact of the national lottery. Much important income will be lost.

The debate has been well-informed and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam has made a clear case for action being taken now. I hope that she presses the new clause to a vote—unless she has had some assurances from the Paymaster General. What discussions has he had with the Secretary of State for National Heritage? Last year, the Department of National Heritage talked about widening support for the grassroot sports of football, cricket and rugby, saying that it would use betting duty to assist in greater development. What discussions has the Paymaster General had on how that proposed framework will be affected by the problems with betting duty?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a crisis in the football pools industry and the consequent job losses will cause great hardship. I hope that we manage to come to a conclusion because decisions are imminent and we need to know how the Government propose to help football and the pools industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I welcome the new clause and the way in which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam spoke to it. I should like to add my voice to those who have expressed appreciation of the work of the Football Trust, which is supported by the pools industry. I feel especially strongly on the issue because a few weeks ago I was present at the Upton Park ground in my constituency—I am sad to say that West Ham United did not win last weekend—when, at the invitation of the Football Trust, the deputy leader of the Labour party and my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) opened the new stand, marking the completion of the efforts of West Ham United to comply with the requirements of the Taylor report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
The club was able to comply with those requirements thanks to a fruitful partnership between an enlightened club leadership and the local authority, but one vital ingredient was the substantial grant made by the Football Trust towards the building of the new centenary stand. Without that contribution, it would have been impossible for West Ham United to comply with the requirements of the Taylor report. I join hon. Members on both sides of the Committee in expressing concern about the future of football if that source of income is lost. I hope that the Government will heed those concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much appreciate the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam introduced her probing new clause. I know that she has a close interest in the pools industry and has taken an equally close interest in the national lottery since its inception. She has discussed the matter with me privately and she has now managed to have it debated publicly. I can assure her that we are watching the evolving situation and we shall fully discharge our already announced intention of keeping the matter under review in the coming months. As I shall explain, there are several factors relating to the national lottery and the pools industry which make it difficult, at this stage, to reach a definitive view on the direction in which we are going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As both Conservative and Opposition Members have said, the lottery has been a huge success. I do not know whether members of the Committee have contributed financially to that success. I have noticed that Liberal Democrat Members have been missing from the Committee for a sitting or two. Perhaps they have something to celebrate. They have not had much to celebrate in recent months. I have filled in the odd coupon but, so far, the lottery has won.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lottery will be of enormous help to the good causes that it will finance. The sums of money that will be paid to fund charitable work, sports, arts, the millennium fund and so on will be greater than anticipated. The Committee should welcome that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would be expensive. I am sure that that is appreciated by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam. As she has a reputation for approving of budgetary discipline to reduce the budget deficit, she is naturally cautious about pressing to a Division a motion that would, in effect, reduce tax revenue and increase the Budget deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable that the Opposition show no such inhibitions, which adds to the long tally of expenditure commitments or tax-reduction pledges that they have made during the course of the Bill. That puts beyond doubt our argument that any future Labour Government would have to raise much money under other tax-raising measures and undertake massive public expenditure cuts. The Opposition's proposed £35 million to £45 million hole in the budget will be noted carefully. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South said that he wished to go further than what is proposed in the new clause—so that sum is a minimum estimate of the cost of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. On the point about the hole in the national budget, does not my hon. Friend agree that the success of the lottery would increase the revenue to the Treasury and outweigh any loss?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, we shall discuss that matter, but we have anticipated the lottery duty in our estimates for the years ahead. If the new clause were introduced, there would be a change in the present budget arithmetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Government calculate the amount of money that the pools would fail to contribute because of the reduction in their business? Last week, the cumulative loss of Littlewoods stood at 18 per cent. A reduction in the tax liability of the pools might lead to an increase in their business and, therefore, no overall loss of tax revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, there is an offsetting reduction in pool betting duty. If we were to cut that duty, as the new clause would require us to do, there would be a reduction in Government receipts. The extra money retained by the pools companies might go into their own profits or additional prizes. The money would not go to the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true—tiiis is the basis of the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam—mat there has been a reduction in pools betting duty. In fact, there has been a decline of rather more than 9 per cent. since the start of the lottery four months ago. That decline has particularly affected the two smaller pools companies. Littlewoods has had a reduction, but of a lesser amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are witnessing a developing position. There are still developments in the pipeline for the lottery. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South mentioned that scratch cards will be introduced. There is talk of a midweek prize. After only four months, it is difficult to be certain about where the lottery is going and the overall end-of-year receipts that can be expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To a lesser extent, that uncertainty affects the pools industry, which has been granted various deregulatory concessions. For example, retail outlets have been allowed to distribute and collect pools coupons; the age at which one can start to play the pools has been lowered from 18 to 16 years; there has been an agreement for pools companies to sponsor radio and television programmes; and pools companies can roll over jackpots that are not won. On 25 January, my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary announced that he was inviting the Radio Authority and the Independent Television Commission to reconsider their advertising codes to permit broadcast advertising for the pools. Several changes, therefore, are still in train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the valuable contribution that the pools industry makes to the Football Trust and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. In passing, I observe—as did my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam in Standing Committee A on 4 February—that pools companies are primarily commercial undertakings and, therefore, their charitable contributions are incidental, whereas a prime purpose of the national lottery is to give money to good causes. That distinction explains the difference in treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to pay tribute, however, to the good work done, through both trusts, by the pools companies. I can assure my hon. Friend and the rest of the Committee that we are in touch with the pools companies and we shall review the rate and structure of pools betting duty and the rate of lottery duty in due course. Those assurances were given by Treasury and Home Office Ministers when the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
lottery was set up and we fully intend to discharge them. That task will be easier to perform as the situation evolves and the lottery and the pools companies start to settle down in the new environment in which they trade and sell tickets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's remarks. I am pleased that he recognises the enormously valuable work carried out by the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and the Football Trust in helping good causes. I appreciate that he is aware of the serious stress and strain on the pools industry and that he has emphasised that he will review carefully the overall picture of the pools industry versus the national lottery—in particular, the rate of pool betting duty. I appreciate that he has listened seriously to my remarks and, therefore, I do not wish to put the new clause to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by declaring an interest that I should have declared earlier. I am sponsored—although I do not receive a personal benefit—by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, some of whose members are employed in the pools industry. That matter has not affected my support for the merits of the arguments of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. I am not, however, persuaded by the Paymaster General's response because, welcome though an undertaking to review the situation may be, the facts with which we are confronted—the alarming decline in the pools take and the job losses that have been suffered—show that the situation is critical and requires urgent action, not merely a statement to the effect that the issue will be examined further. The Opposition fear that, while the Government undertake their review further jobs may be lost and one or more of the pools companies put at risk. We shall, therefore, press for a vote if the hon. Lady insists on withdrawing the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 13 is of wider significance than may be appreciated by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. Although it relates principally to inheritance tax and the failure to index some exemptions, it might have a wider impact. The new clause might prevent discrimination against the institution of marriage and some ethnic minorities, in particular those from the Indian subcontinent. The problem is not one of inheritance tax in general, which is dealt with every year when we index the principal threshold, but of the indexation of specialised thresholds that were set out under the original legislation, many of which have not been indexed for many years—one has not been indexed since 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people might think that the exemption limit for transfers to non-domicile spouses applies to people who do not live in the United Kingdom. That is not the case. It would be wrong for us to confuse non-residents with non-domiciles. It is possible for a British citizen to be nonresident in the United Kingdom, but domiciled in the United Kingdom for inheritance tax purposes. It is also possible for someone to be resident here, but not domiciled here. That can apply where, for example, a British citizen has married someone of overseas origin who is resident, but may not be domiciled, in the United Kingdom. In some of our immigrant communities, someone who married an individual who originally came from outside the United Kingdom may have married someone who is not domiciled here for inheritance tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is especially relevant in the case of the annual exemption for transfers to non-domiciled spouses. Under general tax law, transfer between spouses is an exempt transaction—husbands and wives can give sums of money to each other without affecting their tax situation. However, that does not apply in the case of inheritance tax. It is possible for a couple both to be resident in the United Kingdom, but for one spouse to be non-domiciled here because he or she originated in another country and may have retained connections with that other country or expressed a wish to be buried there. A transfer between such a couple would not be exempt for inheritance tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a husband gives a half share in the family home to his wife and that his wife, although resident here, is non-domiciled in the United Kingdom. If the husband dies, that transfer will not be free from inheritance tax—even though it is the family home, in which the spouse and children continue to live. A tax charge may be imposed that forces them to sell the family home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people thought that the provision applied only to people who live overseas, but it does not. Domicile and residence are not the same thing. It is easy to understand how this measure can impact either on those who work overseas and marry foreign-born spouses, or on those who are immigrants to this country. Both categories of person are hard hit by the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole institution of marriage is attacked by the failure to indicate gifts in consideration of marriage. Among people from the Indian sub-continent in particular, there is a strong tradition of making significant
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
gifts on the occasion of marriage, yet the exemptions for gifts in consideration of marriage have not been touched since 1975. It is 20 years since that exemption was indexed. Similarly, the small gifts exemption has not been indexed since 1980 and the general annual exemption has not been indexed since 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is intolerable. If the procedure whereby exemptions were made under the original legislation was a proper one, and if the levels at which those exemptions were set were appropriate at that time, it is surely reasonable that they should be protected from the effects of inflation. My new clause is designed to uprate the exemptions to restore them to the level at which each was set when first introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only reasonable that we should do that. If not, my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary should tell the Committee that the exemptions are no longer required and that the Government are not especially concerned about the institution of marriage or about the effect the provisions may have on married life, even if they may provoke the sale of the family home. I shall be interested to hear my right hon. Friend give the Government's view of how we should treat those exemptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with care and interest to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). As usual, he moved his new clause with considerable knowledge of and interest in the subject. However, I must say that if this new clause is pressed to a vote, Opposition Members will not support him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that the Government are duty bound to be more clear about the direction in which they want inheritance tax to develop. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the exemptions have not been uprated for some years and that there has been no clarity in the Government's treatment of the matter. At present, 94 per cent. of the wealth of this country is owned by 50 per cent. of the population, but that wealth is not all of the same type. Much of the wealth of middle-income earners is in the form of property. Those people do not have the opportunity to lay off some of their liabilities through gifts such as those we are debating, so the inheritance tax system can sometimes impact more heavily on people with less wealth than on those with sufficient wealth to make regular gifts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party believes that inheritance tax needs to be examined more thoroughly because of the changing nature of wealth for many middle-income earners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Lady accepts that if there is a non-domiciled spouse and one spouse gives half of the matrimonial home to the other—at the current level of £55,000, it would not necessarily be a particularly luxurious home—there is a problem. I am surprised that the hon. Lady is not more enthusiastic about what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, that was why I listened with great interest. The hon. Gentleman raised some issues that need to be tackled, but we are not convinced that his proposal is the best means of tackling them. We are concerned that the new clause would lead to loopholes being exploited even more than at present. I have read the debate which took place in the 1975 Standing Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because I am concerned about what is happening on the river in very close proximity to the Terrace wall. It is water ski-ing.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. Although one may find it jocular that water ski-ing is going on outside, I saw the person ski-ing close enough to have lobbed something over the Terrace wall, which raises an important security issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. His point is extremely serious and it will be reported immediately to the Serjeant at Arms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the debate in 1975, my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Barnett said that he was not prepared to raise limits because of the danger of serious loopholes being exploited. That danger still exists, which is why I encourage the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West to press the Government to examine the workings of inheritance tax. It appears that the Government will not increase the reliefs, which will be left to wither on the vine. If they do not believe that the proposal is the best way to deal with inheritance tax, they should advance a more coherent strategy. However, the Government are neither pursuing the line that was taken initially nor proposing to change the distribution or taxation of wealth through inheritance tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members cannot, therefore, support the new clause. However, we must encourage the Government to think more carefully about the use of inheritance tax. Neither tinkering with the tax nor introducing reliefs is the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inheritance tax system contains many inadequacies and there should be a complete review of it. It hits those who inherit family homes on the death of a family member, but it also allows many loopholes for those who are well off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West will comment on the fact that the new clause would reduce taxation for those who can afford to give substantial lifetime gifts of money, but it would not benefit those who are hit by the tax on a family home when a parent dies.

The issue of one of timing. There is never a right time to reduce taxes, unless one is talking about a Conservative Government just before a general election. We are debating reducing the tax burden on those who can afford to give very large lifetime gifts at a time when we have the largest tax burdens ever. The Government have called
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
upon ordinary people to make sacrifices and to pay higher taxes. This is about the worst possible time to advance proposals that would, in effect, require the rich—and those who are not so rich, but who can afford to make substantial lifetime gifts—to pay less tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks at the new clause more carefully, he will see that the limit on small gifts is at present £250. Did he have that figure in mind when he mentioned very large lifetime gifts? It is quite a lot of money to many people, but no one would call it a very large lifetime gift. My new clause would increase that figure from £250 to £600, which is hardly wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of small gifts, that amount is probably hardly wealth. However, the hon. Gentleman's new clause would have various effects. It would increase small gift exemptions by about 140 per cent. I accept that the figure has not gone up for many years. However, as I said this is probably the worst time to increase it. The Government are calling for sacrifices from ordinary people by imposing increased taxes on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who regards £600 as a small gift is a very wealthy person. Most of my constituents in north Warwickshire would not regard £600 as a small gift. There are other exemptions, which are also considerable. The relief for spouses with foreign domicile is not far off 100 per cent., and that for marriage gifts would involve an increase of 400 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that levels have not been increased for a long time and that a review is needed. I also understand why the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West believes that, at some stage, the matter should be examined, but we should not do that now. It would send entirely the wrong message to the electorate—it would suggest that Members of Parliament believe that now is the right time to improve tax benefits for people who have substantial amounts of money and who have not had their tax benefits improved for a long time. It is not the right time to do that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1776, Adam Smith said that there were four basic canons of taxation—first, certainly, which means that people should be clear as to what they are paying; secondly, it should be convenient for people to pay; and thirdly and fourthly, economy and equity. By equity, he meant that the sacrifice should be equal, which did not mean equal taxation across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would breach one of those canons. It would mean that, at a time when others are being called on to make sacrifices, people who can afford to make small gifts of £100 or those who can afford to transfer more than £55,000 to wives who are domiciled abroad should be able to do so. On the grounds of equity, that does not share sacrifices; it suggests that those who are less well off are expected to make sacrifices while those who are better off are not expected to make such sacrifices and that the House would be worried if they were expected to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has fallen into the trap into which I hoped Opposition Members would not fall. He assumes that the spouse with foreign domicile is giving money to a wife who is living abroad, yet giving lots of cash away to someone who is non-resident. That is not the case. Non-domicile is not the same as non-residence. People can be resident in this country but non-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
domiciled. Given that the law does not discriminate between gifts between husbands and wives, why does the hon. Gentleman single out for discrimination those spouses who happen to have a foreign domicile but who may well be resident in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Non-domicile wives will be non-resident as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does. The hon. Gentleman obviously did not listen to my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West when she referred to the comments made by Joel Barnett, now Lord Barnett, when the measure was introduced. He said that if there were no limit on the amount that could be transferred tax free to a spouse domiciled outside the United Kingdom, a person domiciled here who had such a spouse would be in an unduly favourable position. He could escape the tax altogether on any assets outside the United Kingdom by the simple expedient of transferring them to his spouse and letting her transfer them on to some other intended beneficiary. In answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, that does matter. It creates a greater tax loophole. While the Government are imposing the highest tax burden in history, we should not be making concessions to the better-off members of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aims of taxation are first, to pay for services, and secondly, to promote economic incentives. There was little disincentive effect from past inheritance taxes, as there was no especial impact on present effort. That argument cannot be advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aim that modern economists claim for taxes is the redistribution of wealth. If we increase taxation on ordinary members of society while simultaneously giving further tax concessions to the better off, we redistribute wealth in favour of the better off. That is the effect of the concessions: one person's extra tax concession will be another person's extra tax or cut in services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is this the right time to do that? I do not disagree with the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West when he says that there are many problems with inheritance tax. Capital transfer tax has not been properly reviewed; it has just been changed here and there and renamed. The result is a hotch-potch of legislation relating to that tax, which unfairly impacts on people whom neither he nor I would want to disadvantage and is not an effective means of collecting tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman has a point: the matters have not been considered for a long time and they should be examined. The hon. Gentleman and I agree on that point. However, the hon. Gentleman is simply increasing benefits to those who are better off at the wrong time and, in creating those benefits, enlarging loopholes that some people may use to avoid or evade paying their taxes. The effect on ordinary people who are required to make sacrifices will be worsened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Barnett, although customarily rather good at examining matters, did not think this matter through. If he
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
was worried about possible avoidance, he should have considered the possible results of exempting transfers between two spouses, domiciled here now, even where one of the spouses was resident overseas. That would not affect the position. The overseas resident spouse could then change his or her tax domicile if he or she wanted a tax-avoiding procedure to take money out of this country. That, too, is perfectly possible. By those simple means, they could, without difficulty, under the present legislation, Lord Barnett was concerned about. The position would not be affected at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if what the hon. Gentleman said was true—and I accept that it may be possible to go through those gymnastics in order to achieve what he suggests—he is trying to make those gymnastics even easier than before. At least Lord Barnett has the objective of trying to close that loophole to make it much more difficult to transfer assets outside this country to nonresidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the objective of taxation is fairness—I believe that taxes should be inherently fair—now is not the time to take the action proposed in the new clause. If we are to raise taxes on the ordinary, working people of this country, we should not cut taxes on the beneficiaries of the changes that the hon. Gentleman wants to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the new clause proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West was well intended. I will not cast aspersions on his proposal as Opposition Members have done. It is worthy of consideration. Having said that, I cannot recommend that the Committee accedes to his proposal today, although such matters should be examined from time to time—we do so before every Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party and the Government believe that an increasing number of our citizens should be able to pass their homes and savings unencumbered, from one generation to another. We believe that very strongly, and it is reflected in successive reliefs and exemptions that we have introduced to inheritance tax and in the abolition of capital transfer tax. If the new clause achieves nothing else today, it has certainly drawn from Opposition Members, in particular the hon. Member for Durham, North-West, an interesting new statement that they believe that the tax should be reviewed. They have said that they would consider carefully the reliefs, the changes and the improvements that we have made to encourage the cascading of wealth from one generation to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clear inference for people outside the Committee is that Labour is up to its old tricks by not actually spelling out its true intentions, but by hiding them under the guise of a review. The hon. Member for Durham, North-West said that there should be a thorough look at the inheritance provisions; the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien), in reference to loopholes, said that this was the worst time to introduce the reliefs suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West, and that it was preferable to review the tax system that enables wealth to be passed from generation to generation. There must be no doubt outside the House that the Labour party, either in Committee or in the House, will be no friend of the wealth of ordinary people being transferred from one generation to another. Labour is an equaliser in its tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
policy. The announcement of a review is testament to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister defend the fact that people who inherit a modest family home will be hit by the tax system, whereas those who might be able to transfer lifetime gifts will be hit less hard? Those who are better off will benefit, rather than those who are not better off. We want to review that anomaly. Is he suggesting that it should not be reviewed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should get his facts right. Since inheritance tax was introduced, we have more than doubled in real terms the threshold at which it begins to bite. The £154,000 threshold proposed in the Bill is well above the average price of a house that would be transferred anywhere in this country. When he talks about placing inhibitions on the average family's ability to transfer without tax liability, he does not reflect the substantial increase which has taken effect in inheritance liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause tries to increase the amounts of inheritance exemptions for gifts to spouses domiciled outside the United Kingdom, annual and small gifts and wedding gifts. Gifts between spouses are exempt from inheritance tax. However, the amount of the exemption is restricted to £55,000 where the donor spouse is domiciled in the UK and the donee spouse is not. It is important for my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West and the Committee to appreciate that the amount of £55,000 is available over and above the normal inheritance tax threshold, which will be £154,000 for 1995–96. The £55,000 is added to the £154,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restriction on spouse exemption, dating back to 1975, is necessary—as the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North said—to ensure that inheritance tax charge is not avoided simply by channelling assets through a non-domiciled spouse before they reach the intended beneficiary. Without that restriction, a UK donor could leave all the estate ostensibly to the non-domiciled spouse. As the overseas assets of non-domiciled persons are outside the scope of inheritance tax, the surviving spouse could convert the inheritance to assets offshore before transferring them, tax free, to the intended UK beneficiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Putting the tax-avoidance aspect apart, which the proposed increase would undermine, the number of cases likely to benefit from any improvement will probably be no more than a handful each year. Also, as tax codes of other countries often contain similar restrictions, any unilateral relaxation of the existing limit would not help our position in bilateral negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West was right to point out in his intervention that people could, by changing their domicile in the future, take then-wealth outside the UK tax net system. That is undoubtedly the case. If non-UK domiciles were resident here, they would not normally fall immediately within the UK tax net. However, if the residency extends to 17 years after the previous 20 years, they will be eligible for fiscal domicile in the UK and the inheritance tax will apply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annual and wedding gift exemptions have served well in the context of capital transfer tax, which was introduced by Labour and involved taxation of all gifts
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
made during the donor's lifetime at swingeing rates of up to 75 per cent.—[
	<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members scoff and guffaw, but it is a matter of fact that the tax was introduced by Labour and that there was a 75 per cent. rate. However, the various reforms introduced by the Conservative Government since 1980 have changed all that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government replaced capital transfer tax with inheritance tax in 1986. Inheritance tax is essentially confined to gifts made on or shortly before death. The immediate charge on lifetime gifts has been virtually abolished. There is no limit on how much wealth may be passed on in that way, free of immediate liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have substantially increased the threshold, which is now £154,000, compared with £25,000 when the Conservative Government first took office in 1979. The vast majority of people can now pass on their wealth free of tax. In fact, only about 3 per cent. of all estates pay inheritance tax. The Government believe, therefore, that the annual and wedding gifts exemptions are, in practice, largely redundant. Rather than enhance those minor exceptions, we have helped all estates by raising the inheritance tax threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West that I acknowledge the fact that the current restriction of £55,000 on the exemption for gifts to non-domiciled spouses has attracted some adverse comment recently. It is perceived by some to be inconsistent with our obligations under the EC treaty not to discriminate between nationals of member states. Therefore, we shall review the matter later this year and Ministers will be advised whether any appropriate changes are planned. If there were a change in European Union legislation, it could mean that someone who marries a femme fatale from France, instead of an English rose, might obtain such a benefit. If someone chose to marry the girl from Ipenema, he would be subject to such restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot recommend that the Committee accepts the new clause. For the reasons that I have given and the more general reasons about the Government's approach compared with that of the Opposition, I hope that my argument will commend itself—at least, to Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has responded with great courtesy. I accept that the raising of the threshold for the tax has been extremely helpful. I am aware of the fact that if the non-domiciled spouse has been resident here for 17 years, his or her position would be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that this brief debate has been characterised by the attitude of Opposition Members. The true vision of the politics of envy is rearing its head. The new Labour party is really no different from the old one—scratch it and the old Labour party is still there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather shocked by Labour Members' lack of concern for non-domiciled spouses, especially as the matter may impact on members of the immigrant community. I should have thought that they would have expressed more concern about that matter. However, the Opposition's prejudices about any transfer of money—even as little as £250 a year—make it clear to the Committee and, I hope, to the public exactly where they

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two brief introductory comments. First, I shall not be surprised to be told that the drafting of the new clause is technically defective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would be grateful if the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) would not cross between the speaker and the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked a distinguished tax professional to draft the new clause, but men I took it upon myself to change his draft to make the clause focus on the essential point that I wished to raise. In doing that, I ran the risk of inadvertently emasculating my own clause. I dare say I have done that. After all the strictures that I have expressed during the Committee's deliberations about bad drafting in the Finance Bill, I have no wish to deprive anyone of the pleasure of saying that I am not much good at parliamentary drafting. I have no pretensions in that area, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take the new clause as an attempt to air an important point of principle because it is tabled in that spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I gave some drought to whether I should declare an interest in the clause or even not table it, but I decided that although, on certain assumptions, I might be a beneficiary of the clause, any of us could be losers under the present regime and, therefore, beneficiaries under the clause if it or something similar were accepted. None of us can predict the future. It is commonplace, in discussions in a political, sociological or micro-economic context about the employment market, that we are moving into new patterns of employment. The old concept of lifetime employment with one employer, in the public or private sector, no longer reflects reality for the mass of people, who are having to come to terms with the challenges and opportunities, as well as the uncertainties, of having to find several different jobs during their careers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several aspects of our traditional occupational pension scheme discriminated against early leavers and people who change employer. It acted unfairly towards individuals and reduced inducement to labour mobility,
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
which is bad for the economy as a whole. The Government have addressed many of those anomalies and the introduction of personal pensions was a major step in that direction. However, some distortions and unfairness remain and my new clause attempts to put the spotlight on one of mem—the application of the two thirds rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue has a rule that no one can take a pension that is worth more than two thirds of his final salary. There are a range of exceptions, but as I do not wish to take up too much of the Committee's time I shall not go through them exhaustively. There are many exceptions, or alleviations, available in the interpretation of that rule, which does not apply to certain professions. It is deemed that in some professions—deep sea diving is one—people reach the peak of their powers much earlier in life and are able to take pensions earlier. If, subsequently, they have another pension from a second employment, the fact that they are in receipt of a pension from their first job does not count against them. There is an extension to 13 years from the date of final retirement, over which the maximum salary can be considered for the purpose of implementing the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a concession under which people are entitled, by way of pension, to one sixtieth of their final salary in respect of each year that they have worked, irrespective of the total amount of pension already earned from previous employment. But the basic fact remains that if someone retires from one job and has a pension from a previous job, the first pension can, and often will, be used to reduce entitlement to the second pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall illustrate that point with an example. Let us say, for example, that the chief executive of British Gas—I cannot think why I should especially think of him—were to retire at the age of 50—I have no idea how old he is—and were to receive a pension of about £250,000 a year. Let us suppose that, instead of spending the rest of his life at leisure, he decided to take a useful job as a teacher on £20,000 and he worked for 20 years in that profession. He would be entitled to a pension as a teacher. The pension that he already receives from the British Gas pension fund, however, would be vastly in excess of the maximum two thirds of pension to which he would be entitled as a teacher. As a result, he would not be entitled to his full pension as a teacher; indeed, he may not be entitled to that pension at all. He would be treated differently as a pensioner to someone who had worked for the same amount of time as a teacher. There is no equity in such a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To go from one extreme to another, no one in the House has much sympathy for the much-maligned chief executive of British Gas. However, what about someone who leaves highly paid employment because he is disabled? In practice, he feels able to take on another job with an occupational pension. He might find mat, if he works for more than 13 years at that new job, his entitlement to pension from the second job is cut back and may be entirely removed as a result of the pension that he receives from his earlier employment. There is no equity and no economic sense in such a case. That individual has not received the full recognition for his work that another individual who has done exactly the same amount of work receives. Such a person will have less inducement to accept such a job. It cannot be in the interests of society that, because someone is in receipt of a pension from one employment, he should feel deterred from taking on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
another or that, by doing that, he will be treated on an unequal basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making and would like to ask him two questions. First, what difference does he estimate the proposal will make to the contributions that an individual has to pay if, presumably, he can pick his three best years? Secondly—I have not researched this matter—does his proposal deal only with final salary schemes or will it also affect denned benefit schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My answer to the hon. Gentleman's second question is that I do not think that it would affect defined benefit schemes, because in personal pension and other defined benefit schemes the contributor receives the benefit to which that he is entitled. The money that he contributes is earmarked to purchase that person's pension in due time. In occupational pension schemes that is not the case. When a pension is cut back by the operation of the Inland Revenue rules—my proposal deals with that problem—the pension fund or company benefits by being able to take a tax holiday or to make fewer subsequent provisions for the pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not surprise the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) to learn that I cannot answer his first question or, indeed, any such quantified question that his colleagues might feel like asking me during my brief remarks. Sadly, I do not have the resources of Her Majesty's Treasury or the Board of Inland Revenue behind me and I cannot calculate how much money would be foregone by taxpayers as a result of my proposal. My hon. Friend the Minister may be about to answer the question and I shall listen—as will the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central—with great interest to his answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause, which seeks to remove such an anomaly, rests on sound arguments—equity for individuals and simplification of the tax regime. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Minister is about to stand up and say that all sorts of special cases and rules have been examined and protected in an effort to alleviate, in individual cases, the utterly inequitous operation of the current rules. That may be so, but those rules, exceptions, alleviations and statements of practice involve tremendous obfuscation of our tax system, redundant primary or secondary legislation or rules, and a burden on taxpayers. At the end of the day, they do not protect the many taxpayers who, for some reason, cannot benefit from those particular exemptions or let-outs from being the victims of an invidious form of discrimination by our tax regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the principles that my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding has sought to include in the new clause. I agree that the wording of the new clause is probably defective because it relates to the employment of the individual concerned—whereas, as I understand it, his objective is to make sure that individuals with several employments are able to have the benefit of their best three years in calculating their pension entitlement, which is a worthy principle. I hope that the Government will say some encouraging words in support of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People's working lives are changing these days and it is not uncommon to have several jobs. As my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
pointed out, people who leave highly paid jobs may take more lowly paid jobs towards the end of their working lives and it is unreasonable for the pension system to prejudice them for using their talents in that way as they come towards retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the lack of a level playing field in current pension provision and my hon. Friend is seeking to create more equity within occupational pension schemes. If an individual takes a personal pension, he circumvents the problem and can have a pension that is related to the sums which are built up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on an important issue. Does he agree that the decision to substitute a personal pension for an occupational pension is always difficult and potentially hazardous, especially when transactional costs are involved, even if the sums on which it is based prove to be right, which is not always the case? Does he agree that it would be unfair and unreasonable to push the beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes into such a choice, which they might not otherwise be taking, simply because of the operation of the two thirds rule, on which he and I agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my point exactly. Under the current rules, people can be forced into personal pensions in an attempt to circumvent the problem in the occupational pension scheme tax legislation. I welcome the principles that my hon. Friend is seeking to extend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems can also occur when an individual joins a pension scheme in his second employment and starts to contribute to that scheme, believing that he is accruing additional entitlement. When he reaches the normal retirement age of 65, he finds that he has not accrued any additional entitlement because of his higher level of salary under his previous scheme, so he feels unhappy and disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to give us some encouragement by saying that some amendments to tax legislation in this area will be considered at some time in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tax-approved rules for occupational pension schemes are flexible enough to allow what is generally regarded as a reasonable replacement of income when people retire. That is why the maximum pensions that a tax-approved scheme may pay are related to earnings in the period leading up to retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 591 of the Taxes Act 1988 gives broad discretionary powers to the Inland Revenue on the approval of pension schemes so that people know what is normally acceptable in Revenue-published detailed guidance. That guidance explains that pensions may be broadly based on the best year's earnings in the last five years before retirement, or an average of the earnings of any three or more consecutive years in a period ending up to 10 years before retirement.
