	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I continue with what I had to say on those amendments, perhaps I might mention that the Minister has been very kind in letting me have a schedule of the clauses in this Bill as related to the 1973 Bill. That will certainly be helpful to myself and to my colleagues, and I should like to express appreciation to him for doing that. It is a complex matter. We are dealing with matters where the actual drafting is, to say the least, not simple and, therefore, it is courteous and kind of the Minister, in the general spirit which has pervaded the Committee of improving the Bill, to put forward that set of documents as an aid to our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, we were discussing Amendment No. 102 and the point I was making was that in our view where that amendment appears in Clause 4, at page 7, line 16, the penalties which were suggested of £400 and £40 were, in our view, extremely onerous. Although it is no part of our task to suggest that it would be right for people not to file their accounts on time—indeed, quite the contrary is the case; we
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
are anxious that accounts should be filed as promptly as possible—nevertheless, the penalties which are to be imposed, both on individuals and on the company concerned, seem to us to be too high. We suggest to the Minister that the figures should be amended—for example, in the way in which we suggest, although even a figure of £200 plus a figure of £20 for each day, is one which we believe is pretty onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might just add a word or two about Amendment No. 102, which is related to Clause 4—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Penalties for not complying with section 1</p></blockquote>
before I turn to the other amendments, which have been selected with this one, but which, as I said earlier, are concerned with later clauses of the Bill where somewhat different points of principle are involved. Indeed, in some respects it is only the figures which are the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it on Clause 4, it is suggested that, if Clause 1 is not complied with, every person who was a director of the company during the relevant period should have a penalty of £400 plus £40 for each day in which he delays producing the required documentation. I suggested to the Minister that that would be a pretty onerous penalty on anyone because, presumably, the amounts would have to be paid out of the taxed income of the individuals concerned. I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm if that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister looks a little puzzled: perhaps I might spell it out a little more. We are told here that a person:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall … be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding the aggregate of £400 and £40 for each day…"</p></blockquote>
the accounts are overdue. That is the burden on the individual director who happens to be a director within the relevant time period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, that is a penalty which he would have to pay as a fine like any other fine, such as a parking fine. Presumably, therefore, it has to be paid out of taxed income. t is probably the case that directors of public companies and, certainly, directors of large public companies are not amongst the most impecunious in the country. Therefore, it is likely, under our present system of taxation, that they are paying a very high rate of tax indeed, particularly if they happen to own shares in the company and are in receipt of investment income
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
where they may be paying rates of tax up to 98 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a relevant point which needs to be made. Suppose that the delay is for only, let us say, 10 days. That would mean that the individual concerned would have to pay £800 out of taxed income. Let us assume that he is paying tax at 98 per cent. I cannot do the arithmetic in my head and I have not got one of those little calculators, but clearly if he has to pay £800 net from taxed income the figure is very onerous. I think that may not have been fully taken into account by the Government in deciding these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point to which I have already alluded was whether there should be some differentiation between large and small companies. Throughout the Bill one of the main themes of our argument has been that the Government ought to differentiate between the two, particularly perhaps as regards these penalties, where clearly the task of the company and the individuals who are its directors in keeping up to date with their accounts is much more difficult than if it is a small company—perhaps just a corner shop—as against a large multinational company. I will not weary the Committee by repeating those points. It is simply that I want to stress that I expect to have a clear answer on that, because it will influence our view on this clause at later stages in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points on these amendments are related to the company; and I have already touched upon that. I am not clear as to what extent there are genuine safeguards. Perhaps that would be better dealt with in the debate on "clause stand part", as affecting subsection (2). I will return to it then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 turn to the second amendment in this group—No. 104—which is related to Clause 8 at page 12, line 7. Clause 8 is not concerned with the same set of offences as we were discussing a moment ago, although the figure happens to be £400 in both cases. In subsection (2)(b) this is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £400."</p></blockquote>
On conviction on indictment the penalty is a fine, apparently of unlimited amount. Perhaps again the Minister would confirm that in this case the conviction on indictment is an unlimited fine whereas on summary conviction the limit is £400. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
take that to be the clear meaning of Amendment No. 104, but I should be grateful if he would confirm that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That having been said, this is clearly a somewhat different animal from the one that we have just been discussing. t does not have provisions for an accumulative amount for each day for which the accounts are overdue, and so on. Again, this appears to be a situation where the company concerned will be large, because the whole clause is concerned with group accounts rather than with the accounts of a small individual company. It seems a little curious that the fine in this case should apparently be somewhat less in aggregate than the fine in the case which I discussed under Amendment No. 102.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there is a distinction, as I see it, because here we have the alternative of a conviction on indictment or a summary conviction. This is a somewhat different set of penalties as well as a different set of circumstances from those which we were originally discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn, thirdly, to Amendment No. 105. We are now jumping round the Bill, I fear. This refers to Clause 12 which is concerned with accounting records. In subsection (9) similar provision is made:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(
	<i>a</i>) on conviction on indictment to imprisonment … not exceeling two years, or to a fine …"</p></blockquote>
or
	<br><blockquote><p>"(
	<i>b</i>) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine pot exceeding £400, or to both."</p></blockquote>
Again this seems to us to be a very substantial set of penalties to impose. Amendment No. 105 is designed to reduce the £400 figure to £200.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On "clause stand part" we shall wish to consider the question of why some offences should have penalties which involve an aggregate fine, some a single figure and some a prison sentence, even, in this case, on summary conviction. This is all concerned with company records, as against the making of returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth amendment which we are discussing in this group is No. 107. Here we come to a quite separate set of circumstances where again the figures are the same. The Government seem rather obsessed with the figure of £400 regardless of the circumstances. Clause 21 on page 24 is concerned with
	<br><blockquote><p>"Disqualifiation for persistent default in relation to delivery of documents to registrar."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
Clearly this is a more serious offence, since it is persistent, rather than just occurring on a single occasion. But as regards the monetary amounts—and our amendments are concerned only with those; I have not touched on the prison offences which no doubt we shall come to at a later stage—the figure is again £400 or imprisonment or both. I think that for persistent offenders there may be a stronger case. The problem with these figures is that they give the impression of homogeneity when it does not exist. We ought to consider each of these cases in turn, and I hope that we shall be able to do that in the course of the debates this morning, though clearly there will be problems. Indeed I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) has tabled a separate amendment to Clause 15, which no doubt we shall wish to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come finally to Amendment No. 108 which relates to a fine of £40. Again we suggest that this is too high. That is concerned with the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regutation of names used by oversea companies for business purposes."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary will know that I have had some problems on this with constituency cases and with cases which were brought to my attention as the Opposition spokesman on trade, in regard to the registration of busines names. This is yet another variation on the Government's main theme, which is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a fine not exceeding £40 for every day"</p></blockquote>
as against the higher figures. Clearly, again, different circumstances arise, but we should like to know what the Government's reasons are for selecting this variety of different penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I, in conclusion on this point, before we have the Minister's explanations, make a couple of more general points. One of these is extremely relevant, and has become extremely topical in the last few days, with the publication of the Lonrho report. Many of us were rather surprised to discover that the making of loans to directors, which is contrary to section 190 of the 1948 Act, is said to be unlawful, but no penalty is imposed for such an unlawful act. I am not quite clear what the precise distinction is between " unlawful " and " illegal ", whether it is perhaps the difference between civil and criminal
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
cases, or whether it is the difference between cases where the circumstances are such that the Government merely feel that no penalty is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Trade would like to volunteer an explanation of the precise reasons which lead the Government to impose either no penalty at all, as in this case—which seems extremely curious and which certainly surprised me—to impose a fine, or to impose a prison sentence, either on summary conviction or on indictment. Some general view of the Government's thinking on this would be helpful. It certainly seemed to me that the situation which arose when loans were made to directors contrary to Section 190 was strange. It would be helpful—because we may wish to pursue the matter later—if we could have a general expression of the Government's view on the classification of the different penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken for longer than I would have wished, but the grouping of the amendments in one extremely large group, spreading across the whole width of the Bill, necessarily means that the debate will have to be divided up into sections. We must try to keep the debate as orderly as possible, perhaps taking the amendments in the order in which they relate to the Bill. Different issues are involved at different stages. We look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) suggests that the penalties in Clause 4, page 7, line 16, are too severe. His amendment seeks to halve the size of the penalties. I would remind him that the penalty in this case, as he well knows, is in respect of default in the filing of accounts. I accept that the penalty is a high one. t is not a high penalty by accident. t is deliberately a high penalty. The Government accept that it is so and, of course, they consider that it should be high. I do not think, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) would agree, that it is unreasonably high. After all, one of the main purposes of the Bill is to tighten the requirements relating to the filing of accounts so as to secure a greater degree of compliance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
than regrettably has been the case in recent years. That point has been made, and I do not need to labour it. t is because of that failure that the filing procedures have been streamlined and the penalties for default increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £400 penalty recognises that any default is serious, and the £40 a day penalty recognises that the gravity of the offence increases as the period of default increases. Clearly, the penalties are arbitrary—any penalties are arbitrary—but, as the hon. Gentleman has recognised, they are in line with other penalties under the Bill for what are, after all, offences of a serious nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not recognise any such thing. It is far from clear that any of these penalties is in line with the others. We have a series of arbitrary figures. At the moment, the exact link between them is obscure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman alluded to the fact that the £400 figure occurred over and over again. He recognised it, but he may not have agreed with it. He recognised—I am not suggesting that he agreed that it should be the case—the similarity of the penalty, which is why I referred to it in that sense. The offences are of a serious nature. They do not involve fraud, but they are not merely technical offences. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman must recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would point out to the hon. Gentleman—I am sure he knows this—that the figures are maxima. t does not mean, of course, that the magistrates have to fine a figure of £400. In most cases, they do not impose the maximum penalty. In the view of the Government it is right, and an appreciation of the gravity of the offences that the maximum fine should be £400.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can point out to the hon. Gentleman that the relevant penalties under the present law are fines of up to £200 or of imprisonment for up to six months—that is, for failure to lay accounts before shareholders—and a fine of £5 a day for failure to file annual returns or to annex accounts thereto. The Government take the view that imprisonment is not an appropriate penalty for an offence of this nature, and they therefore repeal it. In view, as I have said, of the large number of companies currently in default—my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
for Trade gave the figures over and over again—in filing returns and accounts, the present level of fines, £200, is, in the view of the Government, grossly inadequate, especially as magistrates rarely impose anything like the maximum penalty. There is, therefore, in the view of the Government, a need to increase the penalties to a level which provides a real incentive to comply with the law; that is the purpose of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman criticised the size of the fines on the grounds that they might impose hardship on those who are late in filing accounts by reason of matters which are perhaps beyond their control. I would refer him to subsection (2), which provides that it shall be a defence to prove that all reasonable steps have been taken to secure compliance. The fines would be imposed only on those who have failed to fulfil this obligation, which is one of the company directors' duties, and even then the magistrate would take account of all the circumstances in determining the fine to be imposed in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested—rather quaintly—that there should be some distinction between the fines imposed on small companies and those on larger companies. I know of no such distinction before the law; I know of no other Act where small companies have been treated differently from large companies, or for that matter where small individuals have been treated differently from large individuals. What the courts make allowance for is the means and the circumstances. If a small company came up before the magistrate, it would be treated, after the court had taken cognisance of all the circumstances, in a different way, possibly, from a large company, but that is for the magistrate to decide. He does not have to impose a maximum penalty, as I have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made the point that all the directors would be responsible and that the fine would come out of taxed income. He is quite right; all fines come out of taxed income—correctly so. It would be a strange state of affairs if someone could set off a fine which had been imposed for a criminal offence as a form of income tax relief. I do not think that would be widely popular throughout the country. I do not think the hon. Gentleman seriously suggests it, but I should like to see him campaign on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure there would not be a lot of votes in it, certainly as far as parking offences are concerned. It was not what I was suggesting. I was seeking to raise the question of how harsh the penalties are. I was seeking to make the point that we cannot really take these figures in isolation. Perhaps the Minister would care, in the course of this debate or in the debate on " clause stand part," to tell us, supposing the individual concerned is paying tax at the maximum investment income rate, exactly what pre-tax income would be required to pay these penalties. Let us assume that the accounts were 30 days late. I suspect that there are not more than about half a dozen people in the country who have an income of that order,. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would care to tell us the exact figure. It is not difficult to work it out; I could do it myself, if I was not occupied with the debate. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] No, it is not for me to provide answers to questions. Come the election next week, it will be fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making a serious point. I am sorry; it is a rather long intervention. I was dealing, not with the penalty on the company, but with the penalty on the individual. I seriously doubt if it is £400 plus £40 for every day and the chap is paying 98 per cent. in the pound tax, whether there are many people who have such incomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I realise he was making it seriously and to illustrate the serious position in which a company director would be if he were fortunate enough to be paying that rate of income tax. I can say that the ordinary individual who appears before the courts for more mundane, but none the less serious, offences will also find it onerous to pay a fine. That is one of the reasons why fines are imposed. They are not imposed as a means of wriggling out of one's obligations or breach of the law; they are there to hit, and to hit hard. Company directors, who are in a better financial position than the individual who is up on, say, a shop-lifting offence, will have to be treated differently and their means will have to be taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with Amendment No. 102. May I now come to Amendments Nos. 104, 105, 107 and 108. The hon. Gentleman's amendments seek once again
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
to halve the maximum penalty, but, with regard to Amendment No. 104, this time on summary conviction for failure to comply with the Companies Acts requirements concerning the form, context and content of group accounts. The amendments do not alter, however, the penalty on indictment, and I can confirm that the fine on indictment is not subject to any maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 105 and 107 would make similar changes in the penalties for failure to keep or preserve proper accounting records and for acting as a director when disqualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108 would reduce the penalty on summary conviction for carrying on a business as an overseas company under an undesirable corporate in contravention of a notice from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal now with different types and levels of penalties, because the hon. Gentleman made this point. I am sure he will appreciate that it is difficult to go into great detail because, as he has quite rightly pointed out, these amendments, which have been grouped together, deal with different points. I shall do my best to deal with them, but if I do not cover any point I shall be happy to deal with it on "clause stand part." I think that the hon. Gentleman allowed me that concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some offences, as he will appreciate, are of the one-off kind—for example, when accounts are published which do not comply with statutory regulations. Other offences are of a continuing nature—for instance, failure to file accounts which lasts for a long time and which becomes more serious the longer the delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first type of offence attracts a one-off fine—that is, a fine with a fixed maximum penalty. The second attracts a fine of a certain amount a day. The hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that some offences attract imprisonment. These are when they are particularly serious, especially when they may involve an element of fraud or attempts to mislead. Fines alone are more suitable when the offence is more technical. I am sure that he will appreciate that. The level of the fine depends on the seriousness of the offence. I hope that will, in broad terms, explain the differences. When we come to the specific clauses I can deal with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
them in more detail. It would be necessary to go into the details of the clauses before one could explain them more fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. I am becoming a little worried. We want to keep the debate as orderly as possible. We have a series of specific amendments here, albeit on a huge range of clauses. It may be convenient to discuss these points on " clause stand part " as well as the points to be raised which do not arise on these amendments. If there is a specific point on these amendments, perhaps it would be helpful if we could deal with it now. The one that the Minister has just mentioned is, I think, a matter for his discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments that we are discussing relating to penalties are a very important part of the Bill. I am worried about the level of some of these penalties which will be -Draconian for many small firms. I believe that they are unrelated to the ability to pay in many cases. I am thinking, for example, of the small corner

shop which may be a limited company, the grocer, the local baker, whoever it may be. [Hon. Members: "Flannel."] However much hon. Members may say that that is "flannel", I can assure them that it is not. There are many thousands of such companies which enjoy the privilege of limited liability. No doubt many thousands of those companies are included in the number of 186,000 which the Under-Secretary told us, at column 122 of our Sitting of 6th July, are in default. One thing we should do in this debate is ask why they are in default. I suggest that one of the reasons that many companies are in default is that they are not able to deal with much of the bureaucracy which besets almost every business these days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks as if every magistrate is going to fine every company director, small or large, £400. Of course he will not. That is the maximum. The points that the hon. Gentleman makes about the difficulties with which small businesses are faced will, of course, be taken into consideration by the magistrates. These are maximum fines. I sometimes think that the hon. Gentleman does not appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate only too well that they are maximum fines, but it is all very well to try to pass the buck to the magistrates and say that, of course, they will decide. But the Bill states £400 and that is the figure which the magistrates will obviously have to take into account when they fix the level of fine, whatever it may be, below that maximum. The point I am trying to make is that these penalties are, in my view, harsh because they must be related to the maximum. That is a perfectly fair and reasonable point to make in a debate when many of us are concerned with the position of small firms which will find themselves in the position of having to pay fines which are related to those maxima if they are in default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, I think one should have regard to the position of many directors who are worker directors. They are working on the shop floor and they travel a great deal. In many companies that I can think of there are no more than one or two—possibly three—directors who are engaged in the process of manufacture. They travel about the world a great deal

	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
getting export orders for Britain, and it is not too difficult for them to be in default of this Bill—or Act as it may one day become. They will then be subject to these penalties. It is interesting to consider what the position of a director of a small but highly successful and profitable company would be if he were fortunate enough to enjoy an income which involved him in paying tax at about 98p in the pound. if he were a month overdue and were to be fined the maximum, on the basis that his income was such that he could afford it, the fine would be £1,600 and he would need an income of about £80,000 a year in order to be able to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the penalties are harsh for the small company. It is all very well to say that they are maxima—fines always are maxima, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out. Clearly, when fines are imposed they are related to those maxima. Therefore, the amendment which has been proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and myself should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I might follow what my hon. Friend has said by quoting an example which I have just worked out here—I hope correctly. One can imagine a very small company indeed with, say, four directors. If the maximum fine were to be imposed on them that would be £400 each and if, say, there was £40 a day for 10 days that would be another £400, so that we get £800 times four, which is £3,200 on that small company. That might be an appreciable proportion of the capital of such a company, let alone its profits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the fine on the directors of the company individually. The burden on the company comes in addition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it is, of course, a burden on the directors individually. None the less, those directors are probably financing the company. If there is to be a fine on the company in addition, that would add to the burden. I am saying that the fine on the directors individually might be enough to break the back of the company and force it out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the magistrates were lenient and imposed a quarter of the maxima, each of the four directors would pay £100 plus, say, £10 a day for 10 days. Even that amounts to a fine of £800, which, on a very small firm, is a substantial sum. I do not think that anyone here will dispute that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for trying, in some way, to relieve the smaller business as against the large. The burden on a large business, as the Under-Secretary himself feels, is nothing like so severe, because those directors are men of substance and they can probably pay the fine. They are probably in a position, in any case, to have had a sense of obligation that they should not get into default. The difficulty with the small firm where, perhaps, the wife keeps the accounts, where she may be away for a time pregnant, where the children may be ill, is that they are not able to fulfil all these obligations properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, there is an example of how business is affected—not only small business but large business—from today's 
	<i>Financial Times,</i> where the deputy chairman of Chubb and Sons says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"May I draw attention to the devastating flood of legislation with which the British businessman is being inundated</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>we have so far identified over 50 Acts of Parliament which reached the statute books in the years 1971–75 inclusive and which impinge directly on business activity. …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>No businessman can hope to absorb this deluge and we conduct our affairs as best we can in the hope that we are not transgressing the law; we certainly do not have the time to check on the legal implications of many of our business decisions."</p></blockquote>
How much more does that apply to the very small firm?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be a defence for him"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the defendant—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to prove that he took alt reasonable steps for securing that those requirements would be comolied with …"</p></blockquote>
1 wonder what the phrase "all reasonable steps" means. Perhaps the Minister could give us some greater measure of definition as to the interpretation of these words. Are they already regularly used in the courts? Is there a standard meaning for them? Or does the insertion of the word "all" in front of "reasonable" imply some more substantial element of burden of proof in his own self-defence than might otherwise be expected? Under the clause we find the fines being imposed on people whilst they have to discharge the burden of proof in their own defence, instead of it being proved that they have done something materially wrong. Of course it is wrong that they are in default. Of course they ought to put in their accounts and comply with the law when this is made. But there is no element of fraud here, unless it can be proved to be deliberate fraud. In the ordinary way it might arise just through inadvertence. I think there is a strong case for the Government to try to find some way of protecting the smaller business against the more substantial fine. I am therefore glad to support Amendment No. 102.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary has said that the court will take account of the amount of fine to be imposed. That is true, but everyone knows that, generally speaking, magistrates are likely to take some proportion of the maximum and work to that because they are not in a position to know precisely what is the right fine in all cases. Often one court will not impose the same proportionate fine as another. Courts are already over-burdened. There are now long queues to get justice. It is a needless burden on the courts to ask them to investigate the capacity to pay of every poor devil who gets caught before them, if he has got caught by mere inadvertence or sickness. That is the difficulty. I ask the Government to look again at this in the hope that they can give a greater measure of protection to very small businesses. For the larger businesses, of course, there must be the fuller penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's reply somewhat disappointing. We appreciate that on some of the points which we raised he will reply on "clause stand part". None the less, we have here not
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
merely one amendment on a single clause, but a series of amendments on a number of clauses. I sought to suggest in my opening remarks that the circumstances of each clause were very different. He has dealt to some extent with Clause 4. He has made passing references to a couple of the others, but he has not sought to justify the penalties which will be imposed under the various clauses, nor to give us any rationale as to why particular penalties should be of particular kinds. As I think he accepted after my intervention, I certainly was not saying that I thought that these were each compatible with those in the other clauses. The circumstances are very different. Whereas Clause 4 is concerned with whether the provisions of Clause 1 are complied with, Clause 8—which is dealt with by Amendment No. 104—is concerned with group accounts. One would have thought that for group accounts the figures would be more substantial. The Minister has rightly confirmed that there is an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The later clauses, for example, Clause 12, which is concerned with the accounting records—I should have thought that this was much the same as Clause 4—have much higher penalties, including imprisonment not exceeding two years, and so on. Again, perhaps conversely, the persistent offence penalties do not seem greatly consistent with Clause 8. The Minister has not dealt with each of the individual cases with which we are concerned in the clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is not it true to say that the hon. Gentleman was an adviser to those who at that time were putting this sort of stuff together? I find it utterly confusing.

	<i>Interruption.</i>] I want to answer the point that was made. t could be argued that the figures ought to be higher than they were at that time. The hon. Member must not suppose that, because a Bill got a Second Reading, which was our Bill and which contained many of these clauses—or, at any rate, variations on them—although not all, that means that we feel that the whole matter should go through on the nod. If the Bill in 1973 had continued its course as it sought to have done—there ought not to have been procrastination for two years on these matters—of course these matters would have been debated in Committee at that time.

Regarding the reference that was made to the 1973 Companies Bill, I do not have the full text before me, but my recollection was that it started by dividing companies into different classes.

I do not wish to delay the Committee unnecessarily. I am not greatly persuaded by the argument of the Minister that these figures are maxima. Of course, they are maxima. That is the normal procedure. Nevertheless, that is the figure which may be imposed. While, no doubt, the matter will be dealt with in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
magistrates' courts, as I understand it will be in some cases, in a fair and proper manner, it is at least debatable whether magistrates are likely to be in a very good position to assess whether the particular delay in, say, performing duties under Section 1, as it will be, was justified, or whether they are in a position to assess the means of the individual concerned. The individual concerned may not wish to put forward in public details of his financial position, one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On small businesses, the Minister says there is nothing in law which distinguishes between small and large companies. That was so until the 1967 Act of the previous Government. Be that as it may, the arguments are clear. It is more likely that a small business will have difficulty in producing its accounts on time than would a large business. That is the essence of our arguments, and I do not find the arguments put forward by the hon. Gentleman very convincing.

The Minister's reply was somewhat disappointing, because he did not deal in detail with the various subsequent clauses to which our other amendments relate, and no doubt we shall wish to take them up again at a later stage.

The essence of the argument is that the figures in the Bill are too high, whichever Government suggested them. I suspect that the figures in our amendment arc also too high. Nevertheless, they show how moderate we are. We look forward to receiving the support of the hon.

Since there are small businesses in Wales—I do not know whether the Welsh are marginally more law-abiding than other people or even more prompt—I think the hon.

The main reason for imposing a civil penalty payable to the Secretary of State, over and above the criminal penalties for which the directors of a company are liable, is to provide a monetary incentive to file on time. The civil penalty is, therefore, in the nature of a late filing fee. It recognises the heavy costs incurred in pursuing defaulters, and it puts these costs shere they belong—namely, on the defaulters themselves.</p>

	<p>I turn next to the Opposition amendment, which has a most extraordinary effect. This amendment would not reduce the penalties for companies which were slightly late in filing but would reduce them for companies which were very late in filing. One does not object to the Opposition standing on their heads, but it is objectionable to try to stand the law on its head and that would be the effect of the amendment. Of course it is wholly inconsistent with the protestations of the Opposition, which have been unleashed incessantly on this Committee, about helping the so-called " small " companies.</p>

	<p>Clearly, companies would be helped much more if they were slightly late in filing their returns by the Government's proposals than by the Opposition's amendment. The only companies that could conceivably benefit as a result of the Opposition amendment would be those which were over a year late in filing their accounts. In effect, they will have been given more than 22 months within which to comply and yet they have not done so.</p>

	<p>I listened with great interest to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
heart-rending speeches that were made on the previous amendment. I noted in particular that the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) said that small companies had more difficulty in producing their accounts on time than larger companies. Yet, within a matter of minutes, the Opposition are totally changing their course. That is perfectly reasonable, but I submit that the response which the Government have made to the criticisms that we thought were fair are reasonable, and I hope that the Committee will feel able to support us.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first comment on Amendment No. 103. The Under-Secretary is from time to time persuasive. On this occasion, I find him wholly persuasive and, therefore, 1 dc not propose to press the amendment. Many of these amendments are of a probing nature to establish the position and, perhaps, provide a convenient peg for debate. I understand very well the point which the Minister has made. Therefore, there is no inconsistency in our attitude. We simply recognise his argument. We hope that on later amendments we shall be equally successful in persuading him. Where the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) will then stand, given that he thinks that we are all in cahoots, lam not sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the Minister's own amendments—Amendments Nos. 99, 100 and 101. I am somewhat puzzled by Amendment No. 99 and, indeed, I do not think that the Minister really explained it. It is often the case that the brief with which one is provided in Government—under either Government—does not immediately explain an amendment. As I understand it, Amendment No. 99, at line 33, on page 7, seeks to leave out the expression,
	<br><blockquote><p>"an amount calculated in accordance with subsection (4) below …"</p></blockquote>
and to insert, instead,
	<br><blockquote><p>"an amount determined in accordance with subsection (4) below…"</p></blockquote>
I do not think we had any explanation of that from the Minister. I am not clear about the difference between an amount which is determined in accordance with something and an amount which is calculated in accordance with something. I should have thought that these two words were, in this context, synonymous. No doubt there is some esoteric reason for
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
the amendment by we have not so far had an explanation from the Minister for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point on Amendment No. 100 and then we come to the various penalties which are imposed by the clause. The Minister suggests that this is in effect a late filing fee rather than a fine as such. I wonder, if that is so, whether it would not be more appropriate that that should be done in that form. The arrangements are for civil proceedings, but would it not be much more economical and cheaper for the Government to impose on some appropriate scale a late filing fee which would, as the Minister rightly says, cover the costs of the operation? We are all in favour of the costs being covered by those who cause them to be incurred, but I am not clear why, instead of simply having a late filing fee, we are to have civil proceedings by the Secretary of State which, presumably, are profitable for the legal profession but not for many other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the idea of civil proceedings seems a trifle unusual, though no doubt the Minister can tell us whether that is a procedure which normally takes place under the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point I want to make concerns the balance between the fines on the directors and the fines on the company. If the matter is one of a late filing fee, we can understand that, but perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to clarify those points and persuade us that it would be best to leave the Bill as it will be amended by his amendments. As I said, I do not propose to press Amendment No. 103.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point that the hon. Gentleman raised—the difference between "determined" and " calculated "—does not give rise to any major issue of principle. t is purely a drafting matter. Under the Bill as drafted, the position was that it involved working out a penalty—one had to add up the cumulative total—but now the situation is pre-determined, and so it was thought that the word "determined" was more appropriate than "calculated". Nobody, I think, would go to the wall on that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member then asked why we did not actually define it as a late filing fee. A fee has to be paid before the accounts are accepted, but the object is to get the accounts on the file. Con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
sequently, we need a method of enforcing the payment of the fee. Therefore, we have this civil recourse on the part of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are certainly some points which arise on subsequent clauses.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to assure the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that I have every intention of replying. Perhaps I should have risen a little earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of "unlawful" and "illegal" in relation to Section 190 of the 1948 Act. May I assure him that there is no criminal sanction for making loans to directors contrary to Section 190. However, if the provision is contravened the person who authorised the contravention will be civilly liable for the amounts lent. Such a person will, therefore, be under a duty to reimburse the company in respect of the loan. I hope that that will assist the hon. Gentleman. As the loan is unlawful, the person who received it will be liable to repay the money to the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised questions about penalties—some including imprisonment and others not. It would be more appropriate to deal with the specific offences when we come to the clauses. I think that you will agree, Mr. Crawshaw, that it would not be appropriate now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can say in general terms that with regard to certain offences which have a penalty of imprisonment and others which do not, the offence of failure to keep proper books of account already attracts imprisonment. Such failure may be a deliberate attempt to conceal the facts about a company's position. If it is a deliberate attempt to conceal important facts, resulting in many people suffering very badly financially, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it ought to attract imprisonment. He asked if I would give him other examples of offences which attracted imprisonment. Making false statements in prospectuses and other documents does. Failure to disclose direct interest in company securities does. Acting as a director when disqualified does. Those are some other examples of offences which attract imprisonment. Certainly I shall assist the hon. Gentleman as much as I can when we come to the specific clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that position. It will be helpful when we come to the later clauses as well as in more general terms. As I have already indicated, we are still unhappy about the overall situation concerning this clause. t may be that my hon. Friend has some other specific points to make. It is right that we should consider what has been discussed on the earlier amendments, and I would not wish to delay the Committee further at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the Minister would be able to give the Committee a more detailed interpreattion of the phrase in Clause 4(2), line 25, relating to the required proof—that the defendant
	<br><blockquote><p>"took all reasonable steps for securing that those requirements would be complied with."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I intended to deal with that. Clearly it is up to the prosecution to prove that there has been a failure to file accounts on time, so there is that heavy burden of proof to discharge. It is then open to the defendant to put forward his defence that, although he has committed the offence, he has done everything he could—he has taken all
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
reasonable steps—to avoid committing that offence. He has to establish this only on the balance of probabilities and not beyond all reasonable doubt, so the burden of proof that he has to discharge in establishing that he has taken all reasonable steps is a lesser burden than that which the prosecution has to discharge in establishing his guilt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 hope that that will help the hon. Gentleman. I think he suggested earlier that a company director might, through inadvertence, find himself in court. May I assure him that the Registrar sends out three reminders before a prosecution is lodged. I am informed that about 10,000 reminders a week are sent out, so it is very unlikely that a company director of a small business would find himself in court through inadvertence. If that were the case, that factor would be taken into consideration by the court. It would be almost unthinkable in those circumstances for the court to impose anything like the maximum fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are those three reminders sent through the ordinary post, or are they sent by recorded delivery, or is the final reminder by personal service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, on this point, the hon. Gentleman said that a lesser burden is placed on the defendant than on the prosecution. I accept what he says with regard to reminders. Normally one would expect this to be a perfectly satisfactory way of reminding a director of a company that he is overdue in fulfilling his obligations. But in the case of a company where there are perhaps only one or two directors—the small type of family business, say, in the retail trade—would it be a reasonable defence that the delay was due to something like family bereavement, pregnancy, or illness of children, where the directors of a small family firm might be preoccupied with their family problems rather than attending to the administration of their business? Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The court would take all factors into consideration. If personal circumstances prevented the directors from complying in time—if they had taken all reasonable steps but were prevented from doing so by something such as illness—of course that factor would be taken into consideration. It would be wrong for me to say in Committee what is or is not a standard defence, but clearly in establishing that they had taken all reasonable steps defendants would put all the facts before the court and the court would take them into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to Clause 5. An hon. Gentleman asked if there was an amendment. My impression is that none has been selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is concerned with:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Default order in case of continued failure to comply with Section 1(7) after the end of the period allowed for laying and delivering accounts."</p></blockquote>
One would have assumed that in these circumstances, namely continued failure to comply with Section 1(7), as it will be, would have incurred a substantial penalty. That would have been in line with the Government's general thinking on the subject. It may be—because, as we know from the diagram which I circulated last time the inter-relationships of the first 11 clauses arc extremely complex—that that indeed is the position. However, it is not apparent from the clause. It may simply arise from saying in Clause 5(3)
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this section shall be taken to prejudice the operation of section 4 above."</p></blockquote>
We require an explanation of the clause from the Minister because it is not quite what it appears on the surface. I should be grateful if he could tell us about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause empowers the court, on the application of the Registrar or a mcmber or creditor,
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
to order the directors to make good a default in the filing of accounts. The provision for a default order is an additional sanction which, taken together with the penalties in Clause 4 and the ultimate threat of disqualification from acting as a director and manger in Clause 21, should secure a higher degree of compliance in the filing of accounts. Does that assist the hon. Gentleman? I am happy to read out the explanation of the clause with its subsections, but I am sure that will have explained it to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister was bending at the knees rather than standing. I am somewhat puzzled by the remark of the Minister concerning the list of disqualified directors, not least because my impression was that this was still in the Insolvency Bill rather than the Companies (No. 2) Bill. I am not clear how that links up with the clause which we are now discussing, nor, indeed, precisely how it links up with Clause 4, which we have already discussed. It would be helpful, and quicker, if the Minister would spell out the position rather more fully than he has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I will do so. Clause 4 provides for the penalisation of those who fail to comply with their obligations. We have already dealt with that. This clause concentrates on the securing the filing of the accounts, which is the primary objective of this part of the Bill. This battery of sanctions indicates the importance which is attached to the prompt availability of financial information. A similar provision is contained in Section 428 of the 1948 Act. Under that provision the court may make an order directing a company to make good a default in submitting returns to the registrar. Under this clause it is the directors who are ordered to comply, as it is on them that Clause 1(7) puts a responsibility for filing the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I briefly go through the subsections. Subsection (1) provides that, if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
the directors of a company have failed to file accounts within the period prescribed by Clause 6 and do not make good the default within 14 days after the notice has been served on them requiring them to do so, the Registrar or any member or creditor may apply to the court and the court may make an order directing a director to file accounts within a specified time. Failure to comply with such an order would constitute contempt of court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that the order requiring compliance may specify that directors in default shall also pay the costs involved in the applications to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that the making of a default order is an addition, and not an alternative, to the penalties provided in Clause 4. Directors liable to pay fines under Clause 4 do not cease to be so liable when subject to a court order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explains the relationship of this clause to Clause 4. The purpose of Clause 5 is to get the accounts filed and it supplements Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are making progress. May I see if I have understood the situation correctly? I understand the Minister to be saying that, in addition to the penalties in Clause 4, if an order of this kind is made and if it is not complied with, the directors concerned will be guilty of contempt of court. There are no doubt additional penalties attached to that, but I am not entirely clear what they would be in these circumstances. If that is so, perhaps the Minister would confirm that I am right in what I have just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which arises from the Minister's remarks, which is a little worrying, is that an application may be
	<br><blockquote><p>"made to the court by any member or creditor of the company or by the registrar of companies".</p></blockquote>
This, of course, links up with the Insolvency Bill which we have recently finished in Committee and for which we are awaiting the Report stage. t would appear from Clause 5(1)(
	<i>b</i>) that any creditor of the company can insist that a default order of this kind is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been considering carefully in the Insolvency Bill various means which were available to a creditor to obtain redress and the payment of his debt. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would spell out precisely what the point under this subsection is. What worries me is that, clearly, as we know from our discussions
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
on insolvency law, a creditor may take legal action in order to encourage, so to speak, the person concerned to pay up. It seems a little hard that, if that is so and a creditor applies for such an order, the costs should inevitably fall on the directors of the company regardless of the circumstances. Would there not be a case for leaving the court discretion in the matter of costs, which I presume is the more normal procedine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I entirely follow the hon. Gentleman's remarks with regard to costs. There is nothing as far as I can see that predetermines the view that the court must take, because normally the rule is that costs follow the event in relation to civil matters. I should have thought that there was no reason for departing from that in this instance. I should have thought that this was a remedy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will speed things up if I interrupt. I am simply puzzled by Clause 5(2) which says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any order made under subsection (1)—may provide that alt costs of and incidental to the application shall be borne by the directors of the company."</p></blockquote>
My point is that such an application may be made by a creditor of the company and therefore the costs are not, as I understand it, left to the discretion of the court. In this particular case, contrary to my expectations and to those of the Minister, the matter is predetermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not actually addressed my mind to this matter before the hon. Gentleman drew it to the attention of the Committee. There is a distinction here between a position where there is a clear fault and where it is required at the instance of somebody to bring the matter to the attention of the court. The situation is not quite as cut and dried as the hon. Gentleman has suggested because it is merely saying that an order
	<br><blockquote><p>"may provide that all costs of and incidental to the application shall be borne by the directors of the company."</p></blockquote>
because that is a matter that empowers the court to exercise its discretion. It was felt right that this power should be made absolutely plain in case there could be any ambiguity. This makes it plain and the court is provided with a power which otherwise it might not have to impose an order against the directors as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 20, in page 8, line 38, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) If a company delivers accounts to its shareholders within less than the period allowed for laying and delivering accounts as specified in section (2) above, copies must be delivered to the registrar of companies within seven days of their despatch to shareholders."</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 6 deals with the period allowed for laying and delivering accounts. Clause 6(2)(
	<i>a</i>), which deals with a private company, stipulates that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the … provisions of this section, the period for laying and delivering accounts in relation to any accounting reference period of a company—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) if it is a private company, shall be the period of ten months after the end of the accounting period."</p></blockquote>
The words that we propose should be added are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or within seven days of the despatch of accounts to the shareholders, whichever is the eartier".</p></blockquote>
We think that this is a useful amendment because companies must be required
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
to deliver their accounts within seven says of their despatch to the share) olders. This is dated earlier than the ad of the 10- or seven-month period roposed in Clause 6(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition feel that, if this requirement is not imposed the present proposals may lead in some cases to greater delays in the delivery than already exist. That is the simple purpose of the amendment which I hope will commend itself to the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree that it is desirable that those companies which lay accounts before shareholders well in advance of the new limits imposed by the clause should also file a copy immediately with the Registrar. We feel that is a highly desirable practice, but we doubt whether this is a suitable subject for legislative requirement—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]—I am sorry if my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) is finding difficulty in hearing. I am not sure that he is losing a great deal. I am reminded of Mr. Abba Eban, who once referred to the United Nations Building as having the most appalling acoustics because it was possible to hear literally everything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will start again. I was saying that we considered it was highly desirable that companies which laid accounts before their shareholders well in advance of the limits which are prescribed by the proposals we are putting to the Committee should also file a copy immediately with the Registrar. That is a highly desirable practice, but we doubt whether it justifies the imposition of a legislative requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential requirement is that accounts should be laid and filed within the period specified. I would not wish to risk distracting attention from this requirement by adding other requirements which are of far less significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, and indeed other hon. Members, on Second Reading said that the Bill contained requirements of great complexity. But, this would be an additional burden and complexity. Perhaps, therefore, they would like to reflect on the consistency of what was said on that occasion with this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a more substantial point is that one of the important features of all this is to enable the Registrar to be able to enforce the requirements that the law prescribes. The difficulty in this connection is that he could not fully enforce a requirement to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
file accounts within seven days of their being sent to shareholders, because he would not know when they were sent to shareholders. All he could do would be to follow up complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is precisely the defect in the existing provisions which we are seeking to remedy in the Bill. The amendment would, therefore re-introduce the same problems which would constitute a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the requirement would have little effect. The many small and inefficient companies will, at best, comply with the basic requirement to file within the period allowed, while efficient companies will in any case follow the practice to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. Certainly, we would hope that that would be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, there would be no sanction prescribed. There is no sanction prescribed for non-compliance in the amendment we are currently considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made a valuable point as regards practice—certainly it would be advantageous if that practice were complied with—I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect that it would not be necessarily right to introduce the provision as one which has legal obligations attaching to it. If it does have legal obligations, in a sense, perhpas it ought also to have some legal sanctions imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to the amendment in my own name which attempts to do exactly the same as the Conservative amendment. I was rather surprised at the response of the Minister to the points made by the Conservative spokesman. I would have thought that it was in the general public interest to have this information filed as quickly as possible. Even though it may be difficult to apply it, it is better to have this written into the Bill than not to have it. There are many points in law where there are difficulties in following matters up. Certain things have to become apparent before any steps can be taken. That is true through a whole range of laws. If we followed the principle that we should not have laws at all unless knowledge could be made available instantaneously and acted upon, we should be in a lot of difficulty in other realms of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made in these amendments is one of public interest. I should have
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
thought that, in that it is acknowledged that the bigger and better companies do this already to some extent, that would be a requirement for putting it across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought also that if a company is not doing this, if it is giving information to the shareholders but not making it publicly available, there may be a good reason for it not doing so, and that would be in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another argument to which the hon. Gentleman who spoke originally and the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) have not yet addressed their attention, that if this requirement is imposed, the way out is to defer putting the matter before the shareholders until the company is in a position to comply with the requirements for the filing of accounts. In a sense, that would be counter-productive to the ends which the hon. Gentleman seeks to achieve. I do not think that would be very desirable. Perhaps it is a point to which he would have come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept there may be some validity in that point. None the less, one has to balance the possibilities of delays to the shareholders with the public interest in making this information available to the public in the prescribed manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there may be dangers of delays to the shareholders, but if it was required to give information earlier to the shareholders—that is where all these come in anyway—surely the company would be making an effort to get it to the shareholders. That is the whole point, otherwise they would be working within the normal prescribed limits contained in the Bill. This is a safeguard situation for the eventuality of wanting to give information earlier to the shareholders, no doubt for good reason. If the reason is sufficiently good, they will give it to the shareholders and they will also make it available to the Registrar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does not the hon. Gentleman see that the company then runs into a position in which it is liable to get itself into a difficulty which, in any event, it need not undertake?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows from that that it will have an incentive to delay. When the hon. Gentleman says that the shareholders in this respect are distinguishable from the public,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
in a sense he is wrong. In this event, it may well be that the public at large would also be aware of the position as and when the shareholders became aware of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Minister would like to follow that line of argument far in saying that making information available to the shareholders generally makes it available to the public. It would be an extremely dangerous precedent to follow that line of thought. Clearly, there is a difference of opinion in the Committee on this matter. I understand what the Minister was saying. To my mind. the balance of advantage is with building in some such provision as there is in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a better way of putting it. There may be a requirement for tightening up the approach. Perhaps the Minister would look at it between now and Report, but, if there is no willingness on the part of the Government to look at it, I believe the amendment should be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an appropriate time for me to explain my own irritability about the Committee generally and what is happening in these three amendments, particularly Amendment No. 89. t seems that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to cross the t's and dot the i's with some precision, whilst recognising that we are dealing here with temporary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has already been made of the discussions on the Insolvency Bill, relative to this amendment, to others still to come, and to some that have already gone. There is a relationship between the Insolvency Bill and this Bill. The difference is that the Insolvency Bill is of a much more permanent character than some of the content of this Bill. The Government, the Opposition to some extent and certainly Plaid Cymru are committed to bringing in radical changes in company law and to restructuring companies and their director methods. The origin of these amendments was 1973, when, as a result of professional advice, it was thought necessary to bring up to date the requirements placed upon companies. This, presumably, is an attempt to modernise the accounting methods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's tongue may have slipped. The origin of
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
these amendments has nothing to do with 1973, to the best of my knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The discussions have gone on for some time about attempting to modernise accountancy methods. I referred to the temporary character of this amendment and all the others that are listed. If we are to restructure companies, in line with our new ideas about worker participation and different methods of boards of directors, including the new approach to participatory management, it follows that a series of subsequent changes will have to take place, including changes in accounting methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be part of a Companies Bill that deals with Bullock and with fundamental changes in company structures. I listened with great interest to what was said the other day, particularly by the hon. Member for Chelsea (Mr. Scott) about the need for auditing directors. That is part of Bullock as regards director responsibilities, however, and the method of accounting that now exists, they must of necessity change if we change the structure of company management to include various groups of directors with special responsibilities. Once those changes take place, the whole business of accounting, the lodging of accounts the registration of company statements, and so on, must of necessity change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I start on these amendments on the understanding that, before anything can be done about Bullock and before these fundamental managerial changes can take place, accounting as a whole must be professionalised. That follows exactly what the Opposition have been saying for a long time, that they want to proffesionalise the whole business. Therefore, there will be many ohanges taking place over the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that in the Queen's Speech there will be some reference to a Companies Bill. I do not know whether it will be called the Companies (No. 3) Bill, but it will certainly include recommendations which will come from Bullock and from a whole series of discussion groups which have been set up to discuss these matters. They are revolutionary. The Conservative Party, the Labour Party and, as far as I know, the Liberal Party and the Welsh and Scottish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wandering from the amendment.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that intervention, Mr. Crawshaw, but I have not noticed any urgency about the Committee's proceedings. t does not seem as if there is a desire on either side to bring to a conclusion what is going on at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely wrong. I have an overwhelming desire to see this Bill on the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is agreed, I do not know of anyone who is making an objection. If we are talking about trivia, let us wrap up and let you read out the whole thing, Mr. Crawshaw, and get rid of it now. There is no objection to it, and I am only saying that both sides should recognise the essentially temporary character of the Bill. I could go on to list in all these amendments and all the clauses of the Bill where, immediately we begin talking about restructuring company management in this country, it will take us directly to accounting the new methods, and the question of director responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment particularly, no matter how Bullock interpreted it and how the recommendations that have been discussed by the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party are applied, no matter what interpretation is made of the Conservative and Liberal ideas in these matters, must of necessity mean that there is a regrading of companies, a grouping of the small people, the medium companies and then different
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
tiers of groups of companies altogether, leading up to the multinationals. Throughout the whole range there has to be this separation. That again must mean that, once it is done, the accounting requirements of the smaller people must be quite different from those of multinationals and a lot of other people, so we have to go through all this in a comprehensive Companies Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my 12 years in Parliament I seem to have gone round this track two or three times. We seem to gyrate round the same arguments, whilst making slight amendments to company requirements. Therefore, my appeal is that we should not spend all this time dealing with this detailed method of accountancy, when before long we shall be involved in these fundamental changes, whichever Government have to take on these responsibilities. The commitment is already there that this must be done. Once the separation of companies according to size and the separation of director responsibilities takes place, and the introduction of auditing directors and professional methods of accounting—which are quite new techniques—are discussed, this Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on. From that point of view I feel that we should not spend too much time on it. If there is general agreement on both sides of the Committee that this Bill should go through as a temporary measure, for goodness sake let us say "Hurrah " and ' Aye" all round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene briefly and start by declaring an interest and appologising to the Committee? I have not been present in the Committee as often as I should have liked because I have been involved in another small matter called the Finance Bill, which has been taking up a lot of my time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a chartered accountant, and I am the chairman of the Society of Conservative Accountants, which produced the chart which caused a certain amount of comment the other day. I know you would not like me to be tempted by the remarks of the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson), Mr. Crawshaw. He made an uncharacteristically unhappy, bitter speech. I wish he would stop talking about professionalising accountancy. I spent three years after university qualifying as an accountant, at a salary which no self-respecting apprentice would ever
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
have accepted. I remember when I got my letter of appointment from the senior partner of the firm for which I worked. He wrote to me saying that I would be thes highest paid articled clerk in the history of the firm. I was 25 at the time and I was offered £3 a week. I spent three years doing that, and I then spent 15 years in practice in the City.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promise the hon. Gentleman that accountants are a very professional group of people and a great deal of detailed professional work goes into the preparation of accounts. An accountant, when he puts his name at the bottom of the certificate saying that in his opinion the accounts represent a true and fair view is taking a major risk if he has not done the job properly, which the certificate claims that he has done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I spoke of professionalising accountants, I had in mind that we heard this morning about the difficulties people could get into if the director's wife is pregnant or if the dog had had worms or some other catastrophe had overtaken the household, so that there might have been a delay in lodging the accounts. I was talking precisely about the professionalism to which the hon. Member refers. I take it that his accounts would not be delayed as a result of any of those contingencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not unless the wife in question who was pregnant happened to be the auditor, which might cause a problem. I must admit that I have not been entirely in agreement with some of the remarks made by some of my hon. Friends, and some of the objections that they have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also say about the Bullock Report that I think that the hon. Gentleman makes a big mistake in assuming that he revolutionary changes in company law which it wants are already in fact. His hon. Friend os the Front Bench is dealing with the situation as it is. The present law is not satisfactory. I do not speak for the Conservative Party. I speak for myself. There is a solid body of opinion amongst people I know who regard the Bullock Report and all that is associated with it as yet another major red herring, and who intend to fight in every way open to us to prevent the changes that he seems to assume are absolutely guaranteed now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
The hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend is quite right in assuming that the Bullock Report is at present a glint in the professor's eye and nothing more than that. It is certainly not a commitment on the part of the Tory Party to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I move on briefly to the amendments? I am sorry to have to say that I think they are rather impractical. For instance, Amendment No. 89 refers to the period—
	<br><blockquote><p>"within seven days of the despatch of accounts to the shareholders, whichever is the earlier".</p></blockquote>
I declare another interest, Mr. Crawshaw. I own shares in a number of companies. I am the controlling director in some and I have never yet had any accounts despatched to me. It is not an event. There is not in the operations of private companies a day, as there is X days before the AGM, when the accounts are put in the post to the shareholders. There is never an identifiable date of that kind. My colleague and I go to see our auditor. He has the accounts. We sign them and I do not even bother to collect a copy of them. Usually I go through them with him and I leave them with him. If I asked him to send me a copy, he would send it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an idea that there is an element of formality about the working of private companics which does not in fact exist in practice. Actually to try to fix the date on which the accounts were despatched unless one made it obligatory to despatch the accounts, would be impractical. In practical terms it is not relevant to the way that private businesses work. My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) knows this, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the additional requirement of seven days for public companies, I agree with the hon. Gentleman when he says that once the accounts are audited, the accounts of ICI, for example, are sent off to the shareholders, and copies are madc available to the Press. The requirement that seven days after that date the matters have to be in the hands of the Registrar of Companies seems to be rather irrelevant. It seems to be the sort of tight restriction which will almost inevitably be broken and avoided, not for any sinister reason. but because it is the sort of thing that might not get done at a busy time of the year. I would have thought that the Bill as it stands puts enough restrictions on companies. The time scales set
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
out in Clause 6 seem to me to be perfectly acceptable, and I am sorry to have to say to my hon. Friend that I think these amendments are a totally unnecessary complication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to envisage narrower amendments than these. It is more interesting to discuss the general state of the political scene and the whole future of company legislation. I want to speak directly to the amendments, but I should like to make absolutely clear the position we have taken throughout. In our view, it is a mistake to rush this Bill through at the tail-end of the Session, with an immense log-jam of Government legislation going through, instead of introducing a new and more extensive Bill at the beginning of the new Session. I believe that that would be the right approach, particularly in the light of recent events, and it ought to enable us to tighten up some of the provisions on auditing company accounts and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That having been said, it is also clear that that side of things would require a Bill which ought to be quite separate from Bullock. I think that this view is shared by the Government. The Under-Secretary outlined roughly the programme that the Government have in mind. In relation to the amendment, it seems to me right, as this Bill is going through in spite of the views I have expressed, to tidy it up as much as we can. Perhaps these amendments are defective, but they have raised an important point which should be considered between now and Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) has returned to his place, because in many ways I think his amendment, which was not selected, is more self-explanatory than ours. There are two simple points which worry us here, and I hope that the Under-Secretary can comment on them. We are worried that subsection (2) is not clear. t is not clear what the period is for laying and delivering accounts when a company changes its status from a private company to a public company, or the other way round. I think that is essentially what is in the mind of the hon. Member for Caernarvon, and it is also at the back of our minds. I think there is a case for making that clear. There is no point in passing even temporary legislation which is not clear. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
why we think the Under-Secretary should clarify this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point relates to the fact that companies must be required to deliver their accounts within seven days of their despatch to shareholders if this date is earlier than the end of the ten- or seven-month period proposed in Clause 6(2). I think there is some fear that the present proposals may actually result in greater delays in delivery than already exist. My hon. Friend may well be right in the remark he made a moment or two ago, that it is unnecessary to tighten the matter further. Clearly we do not want to create a situation under the Bill where the delay is greater than it is under the present legislation, and it would be helpful if we could have the Under-Secretary's comments on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope not to delay the Committee. There can be no doubt that whatever the outcome of Bullock—and in that respect I take a totally different view, not perhaps unexpectedly, from the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson)—there will still be basic requirements that will have to be imposed on companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all companies will be affected by Bullock. The small companies will probably remain unaffected by Bullock for a very considerable period of time and we shall have to look at the position. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of Bullock—in any event, I cannot do that—but there will be these basic requirements. One must make the position abundantly clear where the Registrar is able to enforce these basic duties. This is what this is all about. t has nothing to do with industrial democracy as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all in favour of extending industrial democracy, but my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham must recognise that that is the situation and, therefore, it is not a temporary Bill in that regard. I think he was taking his argument far wider than this clause and this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no relationship between this clause and the Insolvency Bill. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and I spent many very happy days together considering that measure, and I think he will agree that there is no relationship between this clause and the Insolvency Bill—unless, of course, we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
both missed it, which is quite possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be out of order for me to debate subsection (2) now. In fact, there is an amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) which will be dealt with later and which will cover the point to which the hon. Member for Worthing alluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend moves off this question, of course, there is a relationship between Bullock and all the discussions which are taking place throughout the trade union movement and elsewhere about the future of company management. What we are discussing in this Bill is the responsibilities of directors. If we are to change the kind of directors companies are to have or to restructure in a whole series of different tiers company direction and, therefore, company management and give different responsibilities to different kinds of directors, clearly all these matters will be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to impose penalties upon directors as a result of non-compliance with their responsibilities set out here and elsewhere and we are to change the whole of that, clearly these responsibilities will change overnight once the new legislation comes in. That is my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But my hon. Friend must recognise—and I look at the short heading of Clause 6—that this will not be mightily affected by Bullock. Clause 6 prescribes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the periods after the end of the first and each successive accounting reference period within which the directors of pubtic and private companies must lay a copy of the accounts before the company in general meeting and deliver a copy to the registrar of companies."</p></blockquote>
That is a somewhat technical matter, but it is a matter that will apply regardless of Bullock. Bullock will not consider that, I can assure my hon. Friend. What he is right in asserting is that Bullock will consider the responsibility of directors: it will consider the responsibility of companies vis-a-vis the community, vis-a-vis the work force, and so on. Of course. this will have a major effect on company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are dealing here with certain technicalities that almost certainly are likely to remain. They are basic requirements that are likely to be imposed, so far as I can see, on whomsoever may be a director of a company. Of course, there is a dispute anyway about whether worker-directors should have the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
responsibility as other directors. That is a matter which Bullock will deal with specifically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to my hon. Friend that I think that when we are dealing with this technical Bill, we are dealing with a situation where there is a need for change. The hon. Gentleman was right in what he said: there are so many defects in enforcement in the present situation that they must be remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Bullock has reported, it will impose a massive change in company law, but there will still be need for a technical adjustment of company law as well. We must try to see the thing in its full perspective, and not merely say that Bullock will be the answer to everything. It will not. We hope that it will not deal with the massive amount of technical data which the present law prescribes, because we feel in certain respects that the present law requires to be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that I have not strayed too far from the realms of order. I feel that we all have been very close to that, Mr. Crawshaw. I very much share the view of the hon.

There is no legal requirement for doing what the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) said. I think there are penalties, but my balance of judgment goes the same way as the hon.

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 6 stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one outstanding point arising from the views expressed by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) about the position if a private company becomes a public company or a public company becomes a private company. There seems to be some confusion about it. It will also be helpful if the Minister can tell us whether he is absolutely certain that the proposals in the clause will not result in greater delays in the delivery of accounts than already exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow the point made a moment ago about Amendment No. 19, which has not been selected, but which spotlights what I believe is not clear in the Bill—the position regarding company changes. I am looking at subsection (2). I believe that there is a need for some tightening of it if my reading of it is correct. I should be grateful if the Minister would look at the possibility of moves in both directions, and say how he believes that is covered—if it is covered—as the clause stands at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will seize on that in a moment. I see no reason why our proposals should result in greater delay; in fact, the reverse is the case. That is what they are designed to obviate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) is concerned about company changes, and indeed he expresses this in an amendment which has not been called but which, in effect, we are now debating as part of the debate on " clause stand part". Under the clause as drafted, a company which changes its status from private to public or from public to private is immediately subject to the requirement applicable to its new status. A private company which turns itself into a public company has to lay
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
and file any outstanding accounts within seven months, instead of the 10 months which it was previously allowed. Similarly the other way round, a public company which turns itself into a private company immediately becomes entitled to another three months. As a matter of practice, it is only the former situation which is likely to give rise to any difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarvon intended to invite the Committee to treat a company which turned itself into a public company as though it was still a private company, and he would have allowed it 10 months within which to file its accounts, as I understand the purpose of the amendment which he tabled. I wonder whether, on reflection, he would consider that to be an appropriate way of dealing with the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, when a company becomes a public company, it also has to assume more stringent requirements because there is, generally speaking, a greater public interest in the activities of a public company than in the activities of a private company. I say that as a general proposition and, of course, there are exceptions to it. Therefore, it follows that it is desirable that the accounts of public companies should be required to be made publicly available at an earlier date, and this interest in earlier availability of accounts arises as soon as the company becomes public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the requirement that a newly-converted public company should file its accounts within a shorter period than was previously allowed is not likely to prove burdensome. Conversion from private to public status is not an event which suddenly emerges. It is an event which is planned for; it is an event which takes place after a great deal of preparation—at the least, several months of preparation. The company's articles have to be altered, a general meeting has to be called to approve the alterations—all these are an ancillary part of going public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman is perhaps unduly worried about the position, and I think that, on reflection, he would be wise to reconsider his stance. In practice, if the amendment were to he implemented, the effect would be that any public company which started its existence as a private company—and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
most of them do start in that way—would be treated as a private company for the purpose of the period allowed for laying and filing accounts, not only immediately following its change of status but for all time. Again, that is a matter to which he had not addressed his mind in putting down this amendment, and I am sure he would not have wanted that intention to have become fulfilled. I know that the hon. Gentleman has many dreams, but I cannot imagine that is one which he would want to have fulfilled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister turn his mind to one matter? I accept the general points that he makes. My amendment was really a probing amendment to get some clarification on the point of time. What the Minister has said is helpful in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, could he clarify further the situation of a company that changes during the period between seven and 10 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will immediately have to comply with the requirements which are appropriate to its new status, as from the time that it assumes its new status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it may be already in default at that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higigns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not taken the point about which the hon. Member and I are worried. If the company is a public company, one set of limits apply, and, if it remains a public company, that is well and good. On the other hand, if it is a private company, a different set of limits apply, and that is all well and good. What we are not clear about from the clause is what happens if it changes from one to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say that the status changes at that moment—that may be so. The question is whether the whole period of time starts to run again, whether the previous limit applies or the new limit, and, if so, from what date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The company is immediately in default. If it is in default, it is in default. One cannot change that position. Therefore, the matter would be followed up immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the company is changing its status,
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
it needs to take this into account when planning its change of status. I cannot prescribe precisely what is going to happen in a given number of variable circumstances, but the position I outlined to the Committee was a fairly accurate reflection of the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a terribly narrow point, and I do not want to take up the time of the Committee other than to convince the Minister that this is a point which he should consider. That is all I am trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying that if the company is in default, it is in default. It is not so if it changes because there is a different time limit for one type of company than the other. If it may be in default on one set of time limits, but is then given an extension under its new status then it will not be in default. All we are asking is at what particular date does it have the new limits imposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly look at the matter, but my understanding of it is that, if it is in default, whatever may be the consequences of that default will ensue as from that time. The mere fact that it changes status will not cause those who are responsible for the default at that time to avoid responsibility for it. I am not sure whether that was precisely the point which the hon. Gentleman was making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify my point? If a company which had the 10-month period available to it were changing status in, say, the eighth month, and found that at that point it would only have seven months and, therefore, would be a month outside the period allowed, what would be the situation of that company? I accept what the Minister says, that if it is in default it is in default, but does it have to be answerable just because it has changed status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will consider what the hon. Gentlemen have said. I think perhaps the most appropriate way to deal with the matter would be to write to them about it, rather than to prolong this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 21, in page 10, line 25, leave out from beginning to ' in ' in line 28 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The substitution by section 1(9) above of a new definition for the definition of ' financial year t 
	<i>in</i> section 455(1) of the Act of 1948 shall not affect the operation of the original definition".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Government Amendment No. 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 21 is a highly technical amendment—and that is an understatement—even compared with the highly technical amendment we have already had. Its purpose is to ensure that there is a meaningful definition of the term " financial year " in all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(9) substitutes a new definition of " financial year " for that in the 1948 Act. Under the new definition, the financial year is the period in respect of which any profit and loss account prepared under the terms of Clause 1 is made up. This definition, however, says nothing about periods before a company's first accounting reference period, to which Clause 1 does not apply. Clause 7(4), therefore, provides that the existing definition of " financial year " shall continue to apply in relation to such periods. As originally drafted, the subsection only applied to references to " previous financial years " which related to periods before the start of a company's first accounting reference period. On reflection, we have decided that this is too restrictive and might result in there still being a few references to " financial year ", the meaning of which was uncertain. The amendments, therefore, generalise the subsection so that the original definition applies to all references to " financial year " which relate to earlier periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the definitjon of a highly technical amendment is understood and meets with the approval of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Mr. Arthur Davidson.</i>]</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is again an extremely complex clause, which is concerned with transitional provisions and savings. I wonder whether we might have some explanation of it from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides transitional arrangements for the laying and filing of those accounts which relate to accounting reference periods ending before the date upon which Clause 1 comes into operation—that is, the appointed day—and explains the circumstances under which some of the provisions of the Companies Act, superseded by Clauses 1 to 
	<i>6,</i> will continue to apply after the appointed day. The objective is to ensure the prompt laying and filing of accounts which are outstanding when the new provisions come into effect, while allowing a reasonable period for directors to comply and to ensure that the changeover to the new regime does not leave any loopholes which would make it possible for the directors of any company to evade the requirement to lay and file accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps very briefly I might summarise the main transitional arrangements. First, those accounts which relate to any accounting reference period which ends before the appointed day must be laid and delivered to the Registrar within a period of three months following the appointed day, unless the normal time limit specified in Clause 6 would allow a longer period, in which case that longer period applies. This provision is necessary because the new filing arrangements would apply to all accounts not already laid before the company in a general meeting. In the case of a company which is seriously in default at the time when the new arrangements come into force, the accounts may be outstanding for several years. The ncrmal operation of Clauses 1 to 6 would mean that the directors of such a company were in default immediately on the appointed day. The arrangements provide a three months' grace period before the company and its directors become liable to the penalties under Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point I should make is that although the requirement in Section 127 of the 1948 Act that a company should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
annex accounts to its annual returns is superseded by Clause 1, it will continue to apply to any accounts laid before the company but not filed before the appointed day. Without such a provision, the repeal of Section 127 would mean that such accounts would not have to be filed, as they would not be caught either by the old or by the new provisions. The clause has eight subsections, which if I were pressed, I should be happy to read and explain to the Committee, but think I have summarised the effect of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I raise three specific points? First, we referred earlier to the dates on which the various clauses were to come into cperation. Is the Minister able to give us a clear indication of what the Government have in mind? If he cannot, perhaps we could return to the matter at a later stage, because it is of considerable interest to those who are involved with these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Clause 7(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If for any special reason the Secretary of Slale thinks fit to do so, he may by notice in writing to a company extend, by such further period …</p></blockquote>
I am not clear how the Government think that will operate in terms of the Secretary of State being aware that someone may require an extension. The Government appear to take the view that he will be automatically aware. Are we to understand that it is really saying that, if anyone applies, the Secretary of State may, if he seems fit. extend the period? If so, will it become apparent to everyone that they have the option?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point concerns the rather curious wording of Clause 7(7),:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No proceedings shatt be inslituled after the coming into operalion of section 1 above for an offence under section 148 of the Act of 1948."</p></blockquote>
I presume the intention of that is to say that it shall no longer be an offence to contravene Section 148 of the 1948 Act. But the subsection appears to say that, even if someone has committed a previous offence under Section 148, there is a complete chop-off and no one will subseqently be guilty of such an offence. The wording seems rather curious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the extension, there must be an application to the Secretary of State which must be supported by strong reasons. The exten-
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
sion will be granted only in special circumstances. An example of such special circumstances would be the case of a company taken over by new management which finds the accounts in a confused state and needs an extension in order to put them in order before delivering them to the Registrar. There would have to be special circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best that I can do is to explain subsection (7). It is not all that lengthy, I can reassure the Committee. Subsection (7) provides that proceedings shall not be instituted under Section 148 of the 1948 Act—that is, for failure to lay accounts before a general meeting—after Clause 1 comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 148 made directors who failed to take reasonable steps to comply liable to imprisonment and fine. Under Clause 4, failure to lay accounts in accordance with Clause 1(6) renders every director liable to a heavy fine and a company to a civil penalty. I have already dealt with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Section 148 is being repealed, the repeal of a provision does not normally affect any liability incurred before the repeal. Proceedings may be instituted in respect of offences committed before the repeal. Without the provision in the subsection, therefore, directors who are in default under the present requirement and who also fail to comply with the new provisions would be liable to a double penalty, which is something I am sure no member of the Committee would want to see. The new provisions will replace the provisions of Section 148—that is, the requirement to file accounts. It will not, therefore, be possible to prosecute for the old offences under Section 148. Accounts will have to be laid within three months under Clause 7(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that will answer the hon. Gentleman. t is clearly a provision which will prevent a person being prosecuted twice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly it would not be our wish that anyone should be prosecuted twice. But is it not possible under the wording of the Bill and of the 1948 Act for someone to be in default, say, for a previous year's accounts under the old legislation and not be in default in the subsequent legislation? The Under-Secretary has pointed out several times that at present there is a tremendous number of outstanding cases some of which I understand, go back for a num-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
ber of years. As I recall, there were a number of instances in which the companies had not been chased for some years. It would seem rather curious to exonerate them for the earlier periods and be able to catch up with them for the second period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can give me an absolute assurance on that, I shall be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied from my reading of the explanatory notes. Clause 7 gives a three months' grace period for companies now in default. Thereafter, they will be in default under the new legislation. That ought to explain the point to the hon. Gentleman. If there is any ambiguity, of course I shall look at it and write to the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is more complicated. The clause is concerned with the delivery of accounts in the case of overseas companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some difficulties about this. The question is whether the accounting reference period should be the same for overseas companies as for companies in this country, and whether the requirements should be the same. It raises some particular problems in the context of discussions which have been taking place recently, for example, about shipping companies, where there are some relevant points.
