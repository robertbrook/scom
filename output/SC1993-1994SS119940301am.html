	<time>Tuesday 1 March 1994</time>

	<p>
	<i>(Morning)</i></p>

	<p>[SIR MICHAEL J. MARTIN 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Have the appalling, ill-mannered, ludicrous and untrue reports of the Secretary of State's speech in Paisley, which by implication criticised you and the hon. Member for North Down (Sir J. Kilfedder), who in our opinion have been excellent Committee Chairmen, been brought to your notice? The Secretary of State's remarks were carried heavily by the Scottish press. He is reported to have said that contributions have been muddled, rambling and lacking intellectual credibility, and that Labour has made no impact on the Bill. That is an opinion, but I object to the word "rambling". I have written to the Secretary of State asking him to identify the columns of 
	<i>Hansard</i> in which I was either rambling or muddled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more serious than any criticism of members of the Committee is the implied criticism of the Chair. Had we been rambling, you, Mr. Martin, and the hon. Member for North Down would certainly have brought us to order. Do you think that an apology is due from the Secretary of State who has not even so much as popped his head round the Door to see what is happening?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it distasteful that the Secretary of State should make such statements—if it was he who did so—while his colleagues of all parties are spending so much time in Committee. If the statements came from Mr. Alan Young, questions should also be raised. To put it at its best, it is the height of bad manners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the comments that were made at the weekend. I do not think that there has been a criticism of the Committee. I would not expect any hon. Member to criticise the Committee. There has been a criticism of a political party, but that has nothing to do with the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Martin, that I was forced to raise on Thursday in connection with the divulging of information about the Committee's proceedings through channels other than the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was kind enough, as a consequence of my point of order, to release correspondence with Bishop Devine and Archbishop Winning relating to amendments that the Minister intended to table about school catchment areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not clear from the Minister's letter precisely what the Government proposed for catchment areas. There was a misapprehension, fairly reflected by the press, that the matter of catchment areas and how they might affect
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
schools was being addressed in its totality rather than in respect of Catholic or denominational schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When members of the Committee were able to read the Minister's amendments on Friday, it became clear that his new arrangements related only to denominational schools and that, therefore, the Secretary of State's veto on changes to catchment areas will relate only to denominational schools, not to any other schools caught by the creation of new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads to a serious anomaly. Non-denominational schools caught within the catchment area problem trap will not be affected by the Minister's amendment, which relates to Catholic schools alone. That anomaly worries not just members of the Committee, but the community. It concerns the Roman Catholic community because it appears to be singled out. Other churches and organisations involved in education have expressed anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That serious anomaly should bother members of the Committee who are only now being informed by a drip-feed process of what is happening. Could you, Mr. Martin, arrange for the Minister to make a statement to the Committee about why an arrangement has specifically been arrived at that will relate to one form of school in Scotland, but will not apply to a large number of other schools that will be similarly affected by what the Government are doing in education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me answer the point of order. The matter that the hon. Member raised is not a matter for me. The tabling of amendments is in the hands of the Committee. I cannot ask or insist that any member of the Committee, including the Minister, makes a statement to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I thank you for the decision that you have just announced. I was about to ask you whether this was a matter for debate. It once again clearly demonstrates that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman does not know what happens in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the earlier point of order by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), from time to time, all of us may have been criticised in the Scottish press, yourself included, Mr. Martin. That is part and parcel of political life and we are constantly faced with it. The Scottish media are not always kind to politicians, regardless of their party. The hon. Member for Linlithgow and I have occasionally been described in different ways because we tend to express our views clearly, both in and outside Committee. It is not for the Committee to address the antics of the Scottish media, other than to say that they are not helpful to what we are trying to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow, Mr. Martin. I am aware of the kindness or otherwise of the Scottish media, but that was not the point raised by my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend's argument was that the Secretary of State is not a member of the Committee. Two weeks ago, at a weekend, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie made comments on what was happening in Committee. Now, it is the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is pushing bis luck a little. The hon. Member for Linlithgow raised a point of order and I gave a ruling. I said that it was not a matter for me. The hon. Gentleman now criticises someone who is not on the Committee. That is not a matter of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Martin, that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). The Monifieth high school board has written to me. It intends to hold an early meeting to discuss the implications of the letters that were issued to members of the Committee by the Minister with responsibility for education. Those letters were issued prior to the Committee reaching the clauses relating to that issue. They have been released to the press and put into the public domain. People have a right to a response by the Minister who is responsible for education to explain the implications of those letters before public meetings are held to discuss them and before the Committee reaches that point in its proceedings. The Minister has a clear responsibility to clarify the matter by way of an early statement before we reach the clauses relating to education. People are already having to respond to the letters that he has put into the public domain on his own initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are matters that the hon. Gentleman can raise for debate, but they are not matters of order for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Martin. In his speech my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not mention any member of the Committee by name. The hon. Member for Linlithgow seems to feel that the charge of rambling was directed at him. Perhaps by raising a point of order he pleads guilty to that charge. If that is the case, would it be in order for you, Mr. Martin, to ask him to apologise to the Committee for rambling?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me make it clear that no member of the Committee has been guilty of rambling. Whether or not anyone mentioned any member of the Committee by name, I do not expect any hon. Member to criticise the conduct of the Committee because that is a reflection on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), Mr. Martin. The issue affects a school in my constituency. The Government have initiated matters outside the Committee, I appreciate what you said, Mr. Martin, about waiting until we reach the appropriate debate, but there is great concern among the public. Through you, Mr. Martin, may I ask for clarification by a statement in Committee now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are not matters for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the original point of order, Mr. Martin. I appreciate your ruling, but is it not the case that the comments have as much relevance as press reports about members of the Committee wishing to blow up Scotland's water mains?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order about school catchment areas, Mr. Martin. An anomaly has been created in that the difficulties of Catholic sector schools have been addressed following correspondence from the relevant Minister to the Catholic Church. May I be assured that the Committee will receive copies of any letters from the Minister to the Church of Scotland that deal with the difficulties of non-denominational schools and the anomalies created for them? May we see those copies before the letters are made available to the press?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give such an assurance. It is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Martin. I hesitate to prolong matters—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May we dispense with the background noise. I know where it is coming from, so hon. Members do not have to tell me how to chair our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A statement from the Minister, however brief, might clarify the issue. That would be of assistance to the Committee and to the wider community. A minute or two ago, I saw the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland momentarily twitching, which suggested that he might want to clarify the matter to help the Committee. I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, would notice the Minister if he wished to make a point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wants to speak on the amendments, I am sure that he will catch my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I do not twitch: I was rising slowly in my place. In an effort to be helpful to the Committee, I shall set out a full letter about all the complexities on the provisions for the safeguarding of Roman Catholic education. It is a complex matter, which we have considered fully. The Secretary of State and I had a useful meeting with the Roman Catholic education commission and Archbishop Winning last Friday. That was helpful. On the general point, we shall debate that when we reach the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, at least, gives the Committee something to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, I have already given a ruling on several occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has clarified the position to some extent. That is helpful as far as it goes. The problem is that he says that he will clarify the existing confusion, but he is not willing to clarify matters beyond that. The anomaly that has been created by the announcement is no clearer than it was before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a telephone call this morning from the Church of Scotland seeking my clarification. Surely, it is a matter for Ministers to clarify the confusion that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
have deliberately created. The best place to do that is in Committee at the earliest possible time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point. I want to clarify that we now come to clause 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 23</div> <!-- clause -->

	<div class='title'>DUTY TO PREPARE DECENTRALISATION SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 19, line 43, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ba) arrangements for the involvement of representatives of community groups in each area to participate in the deliberations of committees in (b) above.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 220, in page 19, line 49, at end add—

	<p>No. 212, in page 20, line 8, after "consult", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"voluntary and community organisations and such other bodies as it considers appropriate and".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the points of order were extremely interesting. The flaws in the Minister's logic are becoming a bit more obvious. I hope that we will have clarification before we get to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Hamilton, to waste the time of the Committee for 15 minutes and then leave the Committee Room?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows the answer to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister is awake and attentive and has noticed that the shadow Secretary of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply concerned at the conduct of the Committee. I believe that the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, in his attempts to get publicity—he has now gone to chat to the media—is abusing the Committee. This is not a criticism of the Chair. The shadow Secretary of State did not address directly the amendments or the clause that were before us. Indeed, the points that he raised could have been made at a later stage, following the order of the amendment paper. As that is the second attempt, what will you advise him, Mr. Martin, with regard to his future conduct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The conduct of every hon. Member in this Committee has been second to none. I have no complaints about anyone. If members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
Committee wish to leave the Room, that is their affair. There is nothing against that in the Standing Orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must insist that we have had enough points of order. I have been very patient, but I must allow Mr. Connarty to speak to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a genuine point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every point of order should be genuine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that a bottle of Scottish water.has been placed on every desk except mine and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes). Could you draw that to the attention of the Chairman of the Administration Committee, Mr. Martin, to ensure that all members of the Committee are treated equally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to leave the Committee for moment, perhaps the House authorities will be able to help him and his hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I am sure that he will agree that it is an excellent idea to provide bottles of water for members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes the point of my contribution, which is basically who we can trust. Clearly, as London water is unfit to drink and we have to have decent water brought in to the Committee, that underlines what happens when privatisation occurs in the water industry. We will debate that further later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that he is drinking privatised, Scottish water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that we are paying for the functions of bottling and transporting it to London. I am quite willing to pay that extra cost to drink water that is actually drinkable. I pay extremely high water charges in London for water that is not drinkable. I am just worried that Scotland will end up in the same position and have to pay excessive charges for water which at the moment is much more reasonably priced as it is under local authority control and ownership.

To return to the point of whom we and the people of Scotland can trust, I refer to 
	<i>Hansard</i> for the afternoon of Thursday 24 February, and the Minister's dubious use, at column 629, of a reference to a letter from Councillor Roy Thompson, of Falkirk. The Minister implied that I and presumably my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) were unwilling to lead a delegation from Falkirk district council. He read from the letter a passage in which Councillor Thompson told the Secretary of State that he had read that
	<br><blockquote><p>"you were not in a position to meet with a delegation from this Council since it was not supported by the selfsame MP."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 Februay 1994; c. 629.]</p></blockquote>
He was referring to me. I told the Minister then that there had been no request by Falkirk district council to meet the Minister. I spent the weekend speaking with the officials, looking at the correspondence and consulting the members of the administration, and I confirm that there was no request by Falkirk district council to meet the Minister. It appears that the Minister cannot be trusted in the Committee. I remember the point that was made

	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
to you, Mr. Martin, earlier in the proceedings. I wish to deal with facts, because I believe that the people outside for whom we are trying to construct a suitable local government want not just my opinion or the Opposition's or the Government's opinions, but something solid that they can rely on as fact. We cannot trust the Minister to give unbiased information to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we can all trust hon. Gentlemen in the Committee to confirm what they believe to be the facts. We must keep to the amendment, and the events of last week have nothing to do with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Mr. Martin, that I have strayed slightly, and I apologise. My intention was to show that even when a councillor tries to represent the views of his council, he can often get things wrong. We are trying to insert into clause 23 specific references to community groups—the people at the sharp end of the receipt of local government services. We are discussing decentralisation and Labour Members would argue that we can trust people who, usually for no payment, but for the common weal of the local community, get involved in organisations. They do not necessarily seek high office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a major error in the clause and I hope that the Government will correct it on Report. The clause states, at line 37, that the scheme "may include" the arrangements listed. It does not state that it "shall include" them. A worry that might remain in everyone's mind, even if all the amendments are accepted by the Government, or if they are passed, is that eventually the word "may" will be a get out and that clause 23 will be nothing but a fiction, a delusion, a mirage offered by the Government so that when people go towards it the council can take it away. For example—and I sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) will speak later about this—the people of Barrhead, who have been forced into a council of which they do not want to be part, or the people of Ralston, in a council that they do not want, will find that the possibilities in clause 23 of decentralisation giving them something significant to say, that might be accepted, will be withdrawn because the council, in the Government's interpretation, may have a scheme. The Government will argue that a scheme was available but that it did not have to be implemented. Perhaps the Government would consider that word, which is not dealt with in our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are about taking the community groups in each area into the heart of the decentralisation scheme and giving them a significant role. We had a brief debate on community councils. I note that the Minister said that the community councils would be consulted about the scheme. However, the scheme may not give other groups any rights. If community councils say that they do not want a decentralisation scheme, the local councils may not implement it. In the worst of all scenarios, one group of socially and community aware people could be used to block a swathe of other community activists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our problem with the proposal is that the Government of centralisation are pretending to offer decentralisation. It is like a practical joke. As I pointed out about the provision specifying "may" and not "shall", it might not be practical, but it certainly could be a joke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
The Wheatley model of local government gave the authorities autonomy. They could have the right to raise funds and spend them however they chose. They could hand down some power to whichever levels they wanted under the provision to decentralise their expenditure in the original Act. The Government have destroyed the Wheatley model by interfering with local authority power and by taking more and more control at the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider who will take on the rights of a community. The Government have centralised local authority budgets. We had a debate last night on the revenue support grant and, on 14 February, on the housing support grant. Local authorities take those decisions, knowing that the Government have the power, which they use, to give themselves a majority on every single council in the land. It is a mockery for the Government to include in the Bill a decentralisation clause that contradicts their behaviour since 1979 and since they started to force themselves into council decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider housing accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that the Government have become intricately involved in local government finance. Last night in the Chamber the hon. Member for Hamilton suggested that the Government should do exactly that in respect of Kyle and Carrick district council. The hon. Gentleman was encouraging such involvement, but the Government tell me that that is for local government to determine. There seems to be some confusion between the hon. Members for Hamilton and for Falkirk, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with that intervention by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) and with Ministers who make such statements is that under local authority legislation, the concept of guidelines was introduced to ensure that local authorities brought up standards to at least a minimum in each area. That is always a dilemma in decentralisation schemes, which must have safeguards. It cannot be decided that rents will be trebled in one area, but not in others, or that certain services will not be provided for constituent parts of the decentralised area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar logic ran through early local government legislation. Guidelines were introduced to ensure minimum standards, but they have been turned perversely by the Government into maximum standards of quality of service. The Government do not allow spending above certain levels because they do not want such public expenditure. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton was possibly suggesting that those minimum standards in Kyle and Carrick might be breached. I am sure that that question will be asked of the decentralisation schemes. We shall consider some of those schemes under later amendments. Some authorities with a large population of well-off people, might decide to drop certain standards and local faculties because they did not want to pay for them, thus depriving the small number of people without high incomes of those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking about the housing accounts of the local authorities. The Government decided that it was not correct for the rate fund or the non-direct revenue for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
house letting or other sources of funds to be used within local authorities to look after the bricks and mortar of council housing. The oddity is that within those same councils the right still exists for anyone from a private house who does not pay rent to put his name on the housing list and when he has the appropriate number of points to be allocated a house. The people who will gain, and many will, have been excluded from contributing towards council housing. Some thought that that was the wrong thing for the Government to do but the Government have continued to press on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite clear from the local authority capital accounts that the Government have withdrawn a large amount of finance from local authorities and given it to Scottish Homes, which now sets the priorities. The Minister knows that there are serious reservations in local authority areas about what that is doing to the house building programme. The partnerships are sucking in all the money, not just from Scottish Homes but from the local authority's budget, thereby denying it the right to deal with many other critical problems that face it. The councils have now been interfered with. This centralised Government have got themselves involved in the powers that were theoretically, under Wheatley, given to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government decided that they wanted to sell council houses. That policy has created a tremendous distortion. Can we trust this to Government to decentralise? Can we trust them to put in a scheme that will genuinely give some power down to the local people? Their record has been one of centralising and interfering with local authorities at all times. That is regrettable; it is certainly regretted by the Opposition. The Government have become more centralised than most states outwith the former Soviet Union. They have interfered in a way that no other Government have interfered with local authorities. We have the only Government in Europe who refuse to sign the agreement on local government autonomy. It is not just a question of the Scottish Assembly which so exercises my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly not the issue of a Scottish Assembly that exercises me, but that of a Scottish Parliament which would be sovereign over Scottish domestic affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Scottish Parliament that is sovereign in control of all Scottish affairs sounds like an attractive proposition which is not denied other people in Europe. Individual local authorities in other parts of Europe are given autonomy. They are given the right to raise a budget. They are given the right to be judged by their electorate on the way they spend their budget and the policies they pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have decided that they know better than every single council. They interfere with every council in Scotland. I wish they had taken some cognisance of what was going on in Westminster. They could have stopped that definite gerrymandering—people were sold council houses in order to distort the local voting pattern. But they were not interested in that. They are interested in local authorities that tried to deliver services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the balance should be struck by having community representatives from community groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
people who have an interest in the delivery of services at the local level. The Government are now going to get involved again in housing allocation. I do not know whether the Government can confirm the strong rumour that they are to bring out a paper in Scotland about what happens under the Homeless Persons Act 1977. They may have backed off in Scotland because they are more responsible than those who issued the terrible fatwa at the Tory party conference against single parents. That brought about the discussion in England and Wales about withdrawing the rights of young single parents to housing. That is not wanted within local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If community groups and tenants' associations were involved in a local decentralisation scheme the Minister would find a community that was much more sympathetic to the problems of single parents than were the Secretary of State for Social Security and other Ministers at the Tory party conference. People living in the community understand the circumstances that arise that force single parents to look for housing alongside the normally defined family. They are much more sympathetic towards that than the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may have thought that they were tapping a stream of bile that could be turned into votes with their attack on single parents. If they had organisations such as those suggested in the amendments, however, they would have a group of people who understand the circumstances of single parents. The Minister may have taken the trouble to watch the television report of the tragic case in my constituency of the diabetic single mother who died and whose baby then starved to death; technically he died as a result of dehydration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a deep understanding in the community of the needs of single parents. The Kersiebank project, for instance, is run specifically to bring single parents out into the community to look after themselves. In his letter to me on this the Minister says that guidelines and programmes have been brought forward to try to make diabetics aware that they must let the public know what their needs are, especially if they are single and living alone with or without children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The communities that I have worked with over the past 15 years understand those matters. They would not be willing to support a Government proposal that would take away the rights of single parents to housing. They would not allow those people to be made the scapegoats. They would realise that we need to build a support system and give people rights and turn them into mainstream citizens rather than trying to ostracise them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the worst things one can do is to cast young single parents adrift in the community? By single parents I am referring to 16 and 17-year-olds although that category covers a range of people. They can be widows, divorced parents and no one criticises the way they bring up their families. At present we give young 16 and 17-year-olds a house and then cast them adrift. The Government feel that that is a wrong policy. Such youngsters need a high degree of supervision and support. I should like to think that that is how the Government will look at this issue in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree. Such interventions play on the old myths. The hon. Gentleman may think that his constituents will see that as a popular move. I would hope that they would not. I would hope that they saw the realistic situation. As a councillor, I found that when a young girl got pregnant her first and most important decision was whether to have the child. If she decided to go ahead and that caused tensions in her family so that she could no longer live with her parents, the best solution was to find her a home in the community. Often it was amazing how, when the baby was born, her parents would realise that it was an extension of their family and would become much more supportive. They became part of an extended family which was not a bad thing. Eventually, with a bit of luck, the girl would find herself in a new partnership or even a marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served the same community for 13 years. Such families became a solid part of that community. From the beginning of the 1980s to 1990, when I left, I was able to recognise the situation described by the hon. Member for Ayr. Those people could have been made scapegoats. I could have won cheap and simple votes easily on that basis, but the local community was much more perceptive and supportive. By the end of the 1980s, those who in 1980 would have been attacked by the hon. Gentleman or seen as being from a less stable family—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman gives way, we must return to discussing the amendment, which is about community representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community group representatives are active and perceptive; they are the people who should be involved because they have a role, day to day. I mentioned the Kersiebank project, which has many things to offer to the community, such as a meeting place for young single parents. There, they begin to work out how to get through the trauma of single parenthood, the problems of housing and the need for employment. They also often build themselves back into their families, although there might have been resentment about them ending up as single parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People such as the hon. Member for Ayr have been telling people that there is something wrong with a young person who happens to have a child at 16 or 17. He thinks that there is something lacking and negative about them, something to be criticised. He thinks that it is okay to make scapegoats of 16 and 17-year-olds, whereas a 20, 25 or 30-year-old woman getting pregnant is all right. That is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community groups that I want to be involved are those with a deep knowledge of the passage from the trauma of single parenthood and, often, the loss of family support, to having a house, a job and returning to the care of the extended family. They return, we hope, to a supportive family and obtain the sort of support that any parent needs when bringing up a young child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that a community group that should be consulted about
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
decentralisation issues is 16 and 17-year-olds who five in the community, but are denied income support, housing benefit and decent education and training opportunities by the hon. Member for Ayr and his hon. Friends? Such people are still made scapegoats by Conservative Members for being in some sense to blame for the way in which the Government treat them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East is more capable than most members of the Committee of expressing the worries that we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Government have denied many rights to people in the community. The good thing is that groups who understand that have grown up in the community. The people who work in money advice centres and in benefits advice are excellent. They are not just people who are set up and paid by the local authorities; individual community groups are involved. We want such people to be involved in community decentralisation and guarantees that they will have a role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is no such role for those groups, the process becomes a sham. If the stream of decentralisation is just about offices, it means nothing. The Government have included a clause in the Bill that deals with decentralisation. They say that they are serious about it and that we can trust them with it. The reality can be discovered by examining what has happened to regional services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the clause, the Government are the Government of decentralisation. How many of us can forget the fiasco of compulsory testing? Under a previous Minister with responsibility for education, who was driven by ideology and not by practicality, the Government were determined to force local authorities, teachers and parents to put children through testing hoops. There would be ranking in the newspapers so people could compare good schools with bad. What an utter travesty of the education system, but that was the picture painted by the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who is now the Minister of State at the Department of Employment. Conservative Members did not speak out at that time for the sort of groups that we want to be represented in community organisations. Presumably, in a unitary authority, those community groups would have some say over the structure and the function of the education service as well as the other services that are currently run by districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will listen and that the groups will be given some rights. We should also ensure that local authorities listen. More than 80 per cent. of parents in Scotland said that they think it is a distortion of the education system to test compulsorily and rank the performances of children in schools. If people express their views on this, the Government should listen and back off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not saying that and if the clause is only a sop, which pretends that the Government believe in decentralised power, that is a joke. We have had similar debates before. At the heart of the Government's theory is the view that local authorities are too distant, so they should be broken up. Smaller authorities—even of the size of East Renfrew—will be no closer to people in local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
communities, such as a local school area, if the Minister does not listen to the local groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy of opting out is, theoretically, another attempt by the Government to have schools taken over by local groups. Of course, the local group is not necessarily made up of the parents who will need that facility over a longer period. Community groups, which have an interest in education and which should be involved in the committees, will consider not only the school that a child attends, but the school needed for when that child grows up and the school that that child has left. The community requires that school as a resource for other children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's model is "Opt out and run your own school". That really means that the Government will dictate policies and give the money directly. If the Government turn the tap off, the school will not get any money. If they say jump, people will jump because the local authority is not in the middle to defend them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our scheme, community groups will also be education groups. They will come together to support the school in a wider sense, so they will be willing to speak out when the Government, or the local authority, do something that is not in the interests of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joke of school boards is that they are supposed to be about localisation. Thank goodness that the good sense of the people of Scotland means that most school boards support their head teachers and their schools. The Minister who thought up that crazy scheme believed that those boards would be antagonistic towards local education authorities and a half-way house to opting out. The good sense of the people of Scotland has shown that the boards want to work with the schools. Community groups should be part of the scheme and the decentralised structure. That is the effect of amendment No. 219.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often tried to work out why the Government do the things that they do. I have painted the picture of a centralising Government versus a decentralised proposal. The issue has taxed people in many parties, including the Liberal Democrat party, the Scottish National party as well as the Labour party. If the Labour party were setting up a scheme, we would try to get optimum participation. I wonder whether the Government's policy is not just an attempt to cause maximum disruption and decentralisation at the bottom level so that the groups would be a bother to local authorities. We want maximum participation and it is important that that takes place. We do not believe that that will lead to maximum disruption. I do not see any reason for the Government's proposals other than their view that it is something that might trip up a local authority. From the Government's history of the past 15 years, I do not see anything that leads me to believe that they are really trying to support local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach is one of the wider community. The community groups involved could be tenants groups, which are valid organisations, and community enterprise groups. I know that the Minister responsible for the urban aid scheme comes across many community enterprise groups. They are self-generating and have a genuine interest in bringing enterprise to small communities, such as those in my area, where unemployment is often 30, 40 or 50 per cent. Senior citizens could teach a lot of us—especially the hon. Member for Ayr, if he talked and listened to them—about compassion, extended families

	<br><blockquote><p>"the establishment of committees for particular areas and the delegation to those committees (under section 56 of the 1973 Act) of specified functions of the council".</p></blockquote>
Those committees will include certain groups and I am suggesting to the Minister what they might be. It was my mention of old-age pensioner groups that caused the hon. Member for Ayr to rise to his feet. I do not think that the Government have seriously considered the positive role that senior citizens in our communities could play in those committees. The assumption is that OAPs just want to look after themselves and have wee socials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. For many years, the broad view of local government was that senior citizen groups should be social clubs.

It has been especially maligned by the Minister, who appears to be doing a lot of that so that he can dish Strathclyde. We may find, however, that the officers and the ideas of Strathclyde will come to the rescue of many of the authorities that will be set up in the vacuum which will be created by the boundary decisions taken in this Committee.

	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
I am worried that many people in senior positions in local authorities will look at the mess before them, look at the remuneration that they will be offered—which may be challenged by any citizen, as we have found out—and think, "It's not worth the candle. I'm getting out." They will be retired, although technically they may not be above the age when they can draw their old-age pension. Many people in my area who take early retirement from the petrochemical industry, for example, start to work for and with senior citizens groups. They bring with them a wealth of management experience, as well as a wealth of experience of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People seem to think that senior citizens groups are full of people who have something to give only because they have lived a long life. That is not the case. They are often former managers, entrepreneurs who have retired from business, former teachers or former social workers. Many professional people become involved—thank goodness—in senior citizen groups. The example cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South about Strathclyde senior citizen forum is exciting. We are speaking of a creative group of people. Incidentally, in France, people talk of the third age and not of senior citizens or of old-age pensioners. I am referring to serious people who can construct and run or assist in running communities, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plainly, some Ministers may be nearer to senior citizen and retirement age. After the next election, when office is no longer offered to the present Minister as he will be in Opposition, he may want to pursue that course himself. I should hate to think that he would not have a role to play in his local community. I should like to think that he could put back into the community something towards what he has taken out—and he has certainly taken plenty out of it since the commencement of this Committee. He has taken out most of the power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend recall that that forum wrote to each member of the Committee about the Government's intention to do away with the director of social work and an elected social work committee? It specifically asked the Committee to reinstate the statutory duty on local authorities to provide a director of social work and a fully elected social work committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East has demonstrated his knowledge, wisdom and clarity of thought in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is listening. If we believe that senior citizens have more to offer than simply telling
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
stories to primary school pupils about how things used to be and that they have something to contribute from the skills gathered throughout their lives, it is even more important to listen to them when they tell us that certain key local government services and positions should not be abandoned simply for reasons that the Minister will no doubt try to explain when we reach—if ever we do—the provisions on social work and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sports groups in communities should also be involved. The energy expended and the skills demonstrated by sports groups in running their own affairs struck me, when I was chairman of a sports council, as being a power and set of talents that add to a community's quality of life. They are often involved in their own sports, providing a quality of life for their own members. But when considering the wider community and the development of sports policies, for example—which will be part of the functions of the unitary authorities—they could bring much to those deliberations. If the attitude is that those in a sports club should remain on the sports field, as they are not relevant to the definition of decentralisation, that will be a great disservice. Often, they demonstrate much quality and skill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of the Bridge of Allan squash and tennis club. Such a club always seems to have standing in a very posh community, to use a Scottish term. When it became involved in the sports council, it was interested in enhancing the squash and tennis skills for all children in the district. It became a vital contributor to the local sports council and to the development of sport in general, not simply for its own club. We should bring such talent into the groups under discussion. The type of community development of which we speak means involving everyone. No one should be left out, except by his own choice. If some do not want to participate, we should question what kind of system we have set up, what jaundiced view we have given them of the Bill's provisions and what this decentralisation policy could mean for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may finish the list of organisations. There is the new development of food co-operatives and credit unions. The credit union movement is becoming very strong in Scotland. People realise that they will not have to pay the usurious costs of the banking system to have a credit system if they rely on each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to a subject that is of special interest to me. As I am sponsored by the Co-operative movement, I regularly ask questions about credit unions. What he says is true. Recently, I asked about the development of credit unions across the United Kingdom and discovered that there is a disproportionately high number in Scotland, far ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister was listening to my hon. Friend's contribution—I certainly was. As my hon. Friend knows, I have been asked to be the liaison contact for Scottish Labour Members with the credit union movement in Scotland and I find, on looking at the breadth of it, that it is probably the fastest-growing single community movement. I know that members of the Committee will support the concept of people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
handling their own finances and having the confidence to do so, pooling their resources and looking after each other. Hon. Members of all parties must applaud that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of what was called the menage—I am sure that you will remember, Mr. Martin—the shilling clubs. My grandmother, an Irishwoman of great community standing, collected for a number of charities and later she ran a menage. I remember the whole community coming to my granny's house with their contributions. That was the beginning of the credit union movement. If my grandmother is looking down on us today, as I am sure that she is, I think that she would be impressed by what has become of the credit union movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a saying, "He couldn't run a menage."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—and someone who could not run a menage certainly could not run a local government Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such organisations would bring practicality to the representations, and practicality will be very important. I hope that the Minister is considering a decentralisation system that handles finances on behalf of the community and does not exist just to be consulted and to say a few words on this or that and to be disgruntled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final example relates to the image that the Minister likes to present, in which, if local authorities are broken up into smaller organisations, people will eventually feel closer to the organisations. The reality is that if a region is broken up people begin to feel distanced from wherever the centre of power lies in the smaller unitary authority. It will not matter what is said to the people of Barrhead or the other areas that are forced into East Renfrew. They will feel resentful that the power will lie where the Eastwood power has always lain. I do not have a clue where the power lies in Eastwood—I am sure that it is somewhere near Ben Wyvis drive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read in my local paper of an incident in my own district of Polmont—an articulate middle class community with an active community council. The story in 
	<i>The Falkirk Herald</i> had a headline about the council admitting a blunder. The story is probably applicable to other local authorities—not necessarily about a wall but about some other decision. The council took down a stone-built wall that had probably been standing in the centre of the village for 100 years and built a red brick replacement. It took the stone and put it in a builder's yard or council yard, and then consulted the people, and now it cannot find the £24,000 to take down the red brick wall and put the stone wall back up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might think that greater closeness to the community—in an area, by the way, represented by another Conservative on Falkirk district council—would have resulted in the council deciding that the community should have been asked first and allowed to decide. I hope that the Minister's idea is that the money for such general environmental schemes for villages would be in the hands of a decentralised committee in the village and would not have to be approved by council committee procedure, or even dealt with by an architect who spends the budget without consultation, leaving him with a massive row on his hands and an appalling red brick replacement for a wall that has stood for 100 years. Such things should not happen under a decentralised scheme. I hope that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
Minister is considering giving all the groups that I have mentioned a chance to ensure that such blunders do not take place by allowing them to handle their finances and take decisions at the margin. That will not diminish the quality of life for all, but would provide a chance to enhance it. That is our vision, and I hope that the Minister agrees with it and accepts the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments bring us to the important issue of decentralisation. It has taken the Committee some time to reach that issue.

At the start of our proceedings, hon. Members on both sides, including the hon. Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), raised points of order. If the Minister is going to make allegations about Opposition members delaying business, he should make the same allegations about his hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and I am glad that we can now discuss the amendments, which deal with an important subject.

	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister responsible for education is not replying to today's debate. I shall not comment on the fact that as soon as the hon. Member for Falkirk, East stood up to speak, the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Hamilton, leapt to his feet and departed from the Room at a remarkable speed of knots. That is a matter for the hon. Member for Hamilton. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East is wearing a red, white and blue tie, I shall give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that some hon. Members leave the Room when a certain hon. Member rises to speak. Does he recall that when the hon. Member for Ayr stood up to contribute to the debate in our first sitting, members of the press, who were packed into the Room, left en masse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am responsible for many things, but not for the movements of the Scottish press whose members doubtless have reasons for their location at any time. I was not suggesting that the hon. Member for Hamilton does not have the right to sprint out of the Room when the hon. Member for Falkirk, East gets to his feet. That is entirely in order and, indeed, perfectly understandable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not know whether the Minister would give way to me as I am obviously not wearing a red, white and blue tie. My hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. The logic of that argument is that if one of the Opposition Back Benchers is on his feet and the hon. Member for Hamilton is here to listen, he obviously does not trust that Back-Bench colleague. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am being constantly badgered by the Opposition. If they did not constantly demand that I give way I would be able to get on with the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the general points made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. It was clear from our consultation exercise that people value local government service provision. Our proposals therefore require each council to prepare and implement a decentralising scheme for its area. Those schemes will be subject to public scrutiny and, as the hon. Member reminded us, community councils in particular will be asked for their comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not underestimate the benefits of decentralisation. But, and this is the difference between the two sides of the Committee, it will be for the new councils to make the most of the opportunities offered by decentralisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government intend to introduce a similar decentralisation scheme for their own activities or do they merely impose that on others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under my right hon. Friend's proposals the Government are strongly in favour of decentralising our activities in Scotland. That is absolutely clear. In the light of what the hon. Member said, I hope he will not agree with the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. His amendments are about imposing particular criteria—not consultation—for decentralisation schemes on local
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
authorities. That is why he wants "shall" instead of "may". We are taking a much more flexible approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government not consider that the requirements that clause 23 would impose on smaller councils, those with populations of fewer than 100,000, would be unduly burdensome? For a small council the priorities it may have to address in securing the supply of services from other authorities and joint boards will probably be more urgent than the timetable the clause demands for decentralisation, itself an issue that may be less significant for a small council. One understands that large authorities may have different priorities and capacity to consider the issue, no matter the requirements that the clause would impose without regard to local priorities and capacities. Is there not a real problem here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree to the extent that clearly the need for different schemes will vary with the size of the authority. That is why we emphasise the need for a flexible approach. We want authorities to bring forward decentralisation schemes that are particularly appropriate for their individual areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Minister clearly said that the amendment put forward by my hon. Friend seeks to substitute the "shall" for "may". My copy of the Bill states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every council shall have a duty".</p></blockquote>
Either I have a rogue copy of the Bill or the Minister does not know what he is talking about. The Committee needs some clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put the Minister back on track, stop him wasting time and ask him to speak about the amendment. He will recall that when I was leader of Renfrew district council, I introduced a policy of decentralisation. It was vigorously opposed by the Conservative group on the council. As far as I know the Minister supported the position of that group at that time and if he did not, he did not say otherwise. Will he therefore pinpoint the moment when he became convinced that decentralisation was a good thing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I challenge the hon. Gentleman to produce a comment of mine that criticises the principle of decentralisation. That is not to say that I agreed with any particular scheme of decentralisation. Clearly, people can have different views on different schemes, but I have never criticised the principle in any way. Indeed, I pay tribute to the scheme in Glasgow—the biggest Labour-held district council in Scotland—which is an excellent system of decentralised committees. In Highland, the divisional planning committees are another good example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) while welcoming back the hon. Member for Hamilton to the Committee. It is important that all councils build on experience, which is the point that my hon. Friend made. Decentralisation is very much in keeping with the citizens charter. It increases accountability, accessibility and responsiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East asked me about the Government's intentions. We plan to issue guidance to the new authorities on decentralisation, but we do not propose to be prescriptive. We realise that different solutions will be appropriate in different parts of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of guidance, how will the Government ensure that the proposals for area committees and delegations to those committees will not detract from or complicate the arrangements for devolved school management? How do the proposals for area committees relate to existing arrangements for community education centre management committees? Devolved school management seeks to improve the quality of decision making by giving schools greater flexibility and choice in deciding on their priorities in response to the needs of pupils and the aspirations of parents. How will that fit in with the Government's intentions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct to emphasise the importance of devolved school management. I was surprised when the hon. Member for Falkirk, East described school boards as crazy—that was the word he used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the Minister to read the words of his previous contributions. He has taken the word "crazy" when I have used it before. In his reference to the word in last Thursday's debate, he took it from the point where it was used and referred to it in another context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might not have all of his retentive faculties working to the highest degree. Once again, he has misrepresented the position that I put forward. I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
consistently described the Government's ideas as crazy. I have commended the fact that school boards refuse to go down the road set for them by the Government. I have worked closely with head teachers and education authorities.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Lothian, community education centre management committees also provide local decision making.

I know from my constituency anecdotal experience that that has worked well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is correct to say that many decentralisation schemes work well. That is why the Government want to issue guidance and not be prescriptive. If we were prescriptive, we might lay down rigorous criteria that would not be appropriate for every authority in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose that decentralisation schemes should be published by 1 April 1997. Some commentators have suggested that plans should be required before that date. We have concluded, however, that decentralisation is too important to be rushed. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am glad that Opposition Members agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is best for councils to have a year after taking over the responsibilities to develop meaningful schemes which match the circumstances of their areas. There should be no question of decentralisation costing councils money. Councils should be able to save money by having fewer people in expensive headquarters buildings. There are many ways to improve local accessibility to services without costing money, for example, by using existing local offices for more purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a key question for the Minister. If what he says is the case—I go along with the concept of decentralisation—and everything that he has mentioned can be achieved simply by decentralisation, why is he reorganising local government?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with that matter. There should be no question of decentralisation costing councils money. Why should it cost councils money under a flexible framework when we are not being prescriptive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister will accept that his comment about decentralisation costing no money is absurd. Decentralisation schemes carried out in Scotland have been hugely expensive, if done properly. Decentralisation means a need for more staff in outreach facilities and for headquarters. Those provisions cost a substantial amount of money. How can the hon. Gentleman square his comments with this crazy reorganisation which, according to his own estimate, will cost £200 million? Surely he must have calculated the cost of decentralisation before including it in the Bill. If not, he has been quite irresponsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is a duty. Local authorities have a duty to have a decentralisation scheme, but a right to pursue the details themselves. We are not laying down a prescriptive model from the centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be saying that there shall be a scheme, but that it will not cost any money. I do not know whether the Minister has taken the trouble to contact or correspond with representatives of Stirling district council, whose budget was struck with, it was claimed, great savings. Those savings arose from the closure or an amalgamation of the Going Local offices run under the decentralisation scheme. The council admitted that it had substantial costs because the decentralisation schemes in its wards, which were very popular, had to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
maintained at great cost. Otherwise, it was claimed, even more money could have been saved from the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister is not saying that there must be a scheme, but that it will cost no money, and therefore it must have no faculties that will cost money. That seems to be a contradiction. Will such schemes have no costs? If they incur any, will it be all right for the local authority to abandon the instruction in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that under the Bill, the details of the scheme are left to the discretion of individual authorities. That does not mean that in no circumstances will costs be incurred in a decentralisation scheme. The cost of arrangements, and possible savings, will vary from area to area, depending on the facilities available. In some authorities, for example, there may be a network of local offices that are suitable for use in connection with some form of decentralisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important part of the Bill, especially in relation to rural areas. If a local authority such as the new Borders council puts forward a decentralisation scheme, because there is none extant at the moment, and it has a cost attached to it, will the Secretary of State veto such a scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Why should the Secretary of State do that? My general point is that a number of authorities are already pursuing successful decentralisation policies within their existing budgets. There is no indication that the authorities find those policies a particular financial burden. Indeed, in some areas, they can offer savings, with fewer staff requiring accommodation in expensive headquarters buildings and more staff working in out-of-town locations. I envisage that under the new arrangements, any costs associated with decentralisation will, as is the case at present, be taken as part of authorities' overall expenditure and supported in the usual way. Frankly, I do not see any problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister really saying that there will be no extra costs if councils are peripatetic and committee meetings move? If so, what is all the fuss about the European Parliament always being on the hoof at, proportionately, far more expense? Equally, what argument would be advanced against this Parliament moving elsewhere in the United Kingdom if no extra expense would be incurred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under current decentralisation schemes, local authorities do not take it to mean that their committees should be peripatetic, but that there should be decentralisation through such schemes as area committees, where an area committee has a particular local budget.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the local authority concerned. I am not saying that there may not be extra costs. However, it will be up to the new authorities to decide on the details of the decentralisation schemes. Of course, some authorities may decide, rightly and properly, that their scheme will involve extra cost. That is what happens at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with amendments Nos. 219 and 220 on area committees. As I have emphasised, we believe that the authorities should determine, in the light of local circumstances, whether such committees should form part of their centralised structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not prescriptive, in so far as there is no absolute requirement for area committees. That is the point about may and shall. Therefore, I do not consider amendments that would require arrangements for the involvement of representatives of community groups or the provision of officers and administrative arrangements to be appropriate for inclusion in the Bill. In effect, we would be prescribing requirements to apply to area committees which, in terms of decentralisation schemes, have the status of being one of several options available to the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be curious if the Opposition took the view that the Government should lay down such a requirement. The general theme of Opposition speeches is that local authorities should have discretion. That is the Government's argument. Such discretion would be limited by the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation provisions relating to draft schemes are designed to ensure that everyone can have their say about the content of the schemes. As I have said previously—and I am sure that all hon. Members agree—local authorities are responsible bodies which can be trusted to implement policies within a statutory framework without over-prescription on the part of central Government. Therefore, although I appreciate the thinking behind the amendments of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, I do not agree with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the safeguard for local authorities in the word "may" on line 37 of page 19 of the Bill. In that case, the debate should be about whether, if a local authority decides that it shall have area committees, those committees should include the type of groups mentioned in amendment No. 219 and whether, if consultation shall take place, that consultation should be only with community councils or with the organisations mentioned in amendment No. 212. The safeguard about "may" still applies, but the Government seem to be saying that should those committees exist, they are not willing to include on them the groups that we have mentioned. By saying that such organisations have no relevance to the committees, the Minister is devaluing their work when, in reality, they are often the life spark of
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
communities. They should be given respect and a position should the local authorities decide—under the provision of "may"—to have such area committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way undervaluing those groups. The hon. Gentleman referred to community involvement and I have much sympathy with what he is trying to achieve. Amendment No. 212 would require consultation on draft decentralisation schemes with
	<br><blockquote><p>"voluntary and community organisations and such other bodies"</p></blockquote>
as an authority considers appropriate. The present specification is limited to community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's position reflects in part the view that emerged from our public consultation, which showed considerable support for an enhanced role for community councils. I know that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East shares fully that view. There is a problem with extending consultation to voluntary or community organisations in general in that it would be difficult for an authority to know where to draw the line. Not all organisations would necessarily be known to local authorities. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's purpose, but I am not convinced that the amendment would achieve its intended effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposals in the Bill, it will be open to all organisations and individuals to comment on the draft decentralisation schemes that are prepared by the new authorities at an early stage. We have concentrated on subsection (2), but under subsection (3), authorities will be obliged to publicise their draft schemes and under subsection (5), they will be obliged to consider representations about them. There is no shortage of opportunity for everyone to become involved in the formulation of decentralisation schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the two sides of the Committee is perhaps not one of the objectives of decentralisation, as was clear from the speech of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. Although I appreciate the motivation behind the amendments, I am unable to accept them for the reasons I have given in relation to amendment No. 212. Moreover, the other amendments would be too prescriptive and we are anxious to avoid laying down a rigid pattern of rules and regulations in such matters from central Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming back to the Committee the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). I hope that his press briefing went well. I hope, too, that he made clear to the press the position of Monifieth high school, other non-denominational schools—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—and
Paisley grammar school and many others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The press are no further forward in obtaining clarification on this matter. I asked them whether they received the necessary clarification from the Minister and I was told that they did not. Therefore, we shall have to continue to pursue the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valuable, comment. The press have been treated with the same contempt as have members of the Committee and, indeed, the children who attend those schools and their parents who want to know what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to accuse the Minister of not knowing what he talks about, not because I think that he does know, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
because he is backed up by able civil servants, who most certainly do know what they are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understood the Minister correctly, he argued against my hon. Friends' amendments on the basis that they were prescriptive. In line 31 on page 19 of the Bill, clause 23(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every council shall have a duty to prepare a draft decentralisation scheme".</p></blockquote>
That is prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 33, subsection (2) states that a decentralisation scheme
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall contain a council's proposals for the administration of their functions".</p></blockquote>
Again, the Government are being prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in line 37, subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the foregoing, may include provision as to".</p></blockquote>
That leaves it to the councils to decide what to include in the decentralisation schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends' amendments—especially Nos. 219 and 220—would not alter the basic position between lines 31 and lines 37. They would amend the clause after line 37. They are not prescriptive in any way. It remains a matter for the local authorities to decide whether to add in to the schemes what is suggested in my hon. Friends' amendments. We are not telling local authorities what they should do; we are trying to contain in the Bill suggestions about what they might do, if it so pleased them. Therefore, the Minister's central argument against the amendments falls. The amendments are not prescriptive; they would leave it in the hands of local authorities to decide whether they want to carry through what is suggested in the amendments. The Minister may not—perhaps belatedly—realise his error. He may decide that there is no point in proceeding with this debate, that he will simply withdraw his objections to my hon. Friends' amendments and will let them go through unopposed. I certainly hope that that is so—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head and I wonder why. Why does he resist amendments that are not prescriptive? I can only assume that the Minister wants to make it easier for some local authorities not to do the kind of things that the amendments suggest. The amendments may be prescriptive in terms of councils such as Kyle and Carrick and Stirling—the new all-singing, all-dancing Tory councils that the Bill will create—because they would have to contain the proposals for a decentralisation scheme in a draft document. According to the Bill, however, those authorities do not have to decentralise anything. They do not have to approach or talk to the local community organisations, listen to them and carry out the actions that those local communities suggest. That worries me, because I know exactly what Kyle and Carrick and Stirling are about, and that is cutting council taxes and reducing the cost of services. If they approach the local communities for which they are responsible, and if those ask for additional services, for additional employees to be taken on by local government, and for certain services to be kept in the public sector, those local authorities will not be pleased to have such information returned to them. They are determined to do away with those services anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we are not the Stalinists. We want to impose on local authorities certain democratic standards that require them to listen to the people over whom they preside, about the services that they want. The Tories want to allow rogue Tory councils to avoid meeting standards, because they are all about cutting standards, particularly local council standards. That is why the Minister is rejecting the amendments and why he does not want the BiU to ensure that local authorities should consult community groups and provide officers to enable

	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's arguments for resisting the amendments are bogus and that is clear to anyone who spends a minute reading the clause and the amendments. The Minister's arguments do not stand up for a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to the Minister proclaiming the importance of the decentralisation aspect of the Bill. The Committee is united in the belief that that is good and worthwhile. Would not it be useful to reflect on Stirling district council, however, which I dealt with at some length in the Chamber last night? As part of its budget cuts, Stirling district council has axed the two Going Local offices in Plean and Cowie. The experiment in decentralisation in which the once Labour-controlled Stirling district council was engaged, which should have gained Conservative plaudits, is now being put into reverse by a council that wants to centralise and to sack people to save money. On the one hand we are hearing a philosophy of decentralisation and on the other we see that the Tory reality is the complete opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made the exact point to defeat the hon. Member for Ayr, who has put his head down and returned to his correspondence. He does not want to engage in a debate that shows his arguments to be absolutely bogus. The Minister says that he wants to leave matters to councils and wants councils to decentralise decision making away from council chambers. Tory councils are, however, closing local offices to save money to reduce the council tax; they are not interested in decentralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is bogus because the Government are not interested in decentralisation. They are interested only in giving the impression that they are interested. The truth in the real world of Scotland is different. People think that their local decentralised services are being taken away to reduce the burden on council tax payers. That is what it is all about. No one on the Opposition side of the Committee is fooled. Most important, no one in Scotland will be fooled because they do not judge the Tory party by what it says in the Committee Room; they judge it by what Tory councils do, and they see what they do all too clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from putting my head down, I am listening carefully to every word that the hon. Gentleman says, but he is way off the mark.

If people do not like what is being done in Stirling, they will change the council.

Before the hon. Gentleman becomes too confident about the futures of Kyle and Carrick, of Stirling or even of the new Stewartry of Eastwood, he
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>

Why should Opposition Members take seriously the Government's claim to want to decentralise decision making? For example, five Conservative Members in the Committee do not even five in the country, but are involved in taking the key decisions about what will happen to local government in Scotland. Where is the logic or the democracy in decentralising decision making in Scotland to Stroud, to Blackpool and to the other places in England and Wales which those Conservative Members represent?

The first sentence of the clause imposes a duty on local authorities. The Government rarely impose duties on anyone and they are particularly anxious that no duty should be imposed on them. On every Bill on which I have served, I have noted that they never want duties to be imposed on the Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland to do this, that or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North was a member of the first Committee on which I served, which considered the Housing (Scotland) Bill. On that occasion, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, led for the Government and we succeeded in getting the Government to impose a duty on their national housing agency, Scottish Homes, to deal with homelessness. Our proposal was resisted time and time again, however, by the Minister and by the hon. Member for Tayside, North and his colleagues because they did want duties to be imposed on central Government. They always want the maximum flexibility for central Government to do as they see fit, despite what anyone else thinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the key ingredient that we should understand about the Bill. The Government are not interested in giving real decision-making powers to anybody. They want to keep the powers for themselves.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall consider the Bill, and particularly the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some discussion about the costs involved in the decentralisation scheme proposed by the Bill. I know that the Government are anxious to avoid any additional costs to local government. For example, there is no statutory responsibility on councils to provide victim support schemes. No doubt that is because that has a cost implication. The same is true of nursery education and child-care facilities. If statutory obligations
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
were placed on local authorities to provide such services, that would have cost implications for the Government. That is why they are against the imposition of such obligations on those local authorities.

The Government have imposed a duty on local authorities to adopt a decentralisation scheme, but they have not placed a duty on them regarding the type of scheme that it should be. The hon. Member for Angus, East is right; introducing a proper decentralisation scheme has cost implications. For example, if the new Angus council meets not only in Forfar, but in Arbroath, Brechin and throughout the council area, there will be cost implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but the costs involved would be mitigated because the old borough council offices still exist. There are council chambers in Kirriemuir, Brechin and other areas. The hon. Gentleman's fundamental point is, however, correct. The council cannot meet in those places without extra cost. As the Government are not giving any extra money, that cost must be met from existing services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. Costs other than those of running the council chambers are involved, for example, the travelling expenses of councillors and the costs involved in moving council offices and the administration. The Minister is saying, "Go ahead. Set up a decentralisation scheme. Let the council meet in different communities, but you pay for it." Local authorities will have to pay by finding the money from their own resources and council tax payers. One thing is certain: the Government will not pay. That is the difference between "shall" in the first six lines of the clause and "may" in the next line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fine 37, the clause states that the decentralisation scheme
	<br><blockquote><p>"may include provision as to".</p></blockquote>
That means that the Government are leaving the decision with local authorities. If local authorities want to introduce schemes with cost implications, they can, but they will get no financial backing from the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Government. They will not spend one penny on anything that improves democracy in Scotland in any way. That will not surprise any hon. Member who knows this Government's record over many years, particularly their refusal to implement a Scottish Parliament, which is the key demand of the Scottish people. The Government have set up quangos across the country, which are not accountable to anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I place on the record that I, too, was not the Labour Member? I think that the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross would have been a great addition to the Committee and its workings. He has always been entertaining and amusing on any Committee on which I have served with him. More importantly, he is likely to vote against the Government and so he would have been a welcome addition for us. I suspect that it is because of his track record that the Government would not let him on to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing decentralisation and whether the Government are serious about it. I refer the Committee to a speech given by the Secretary of State for Scotland in defence of the large number of quangos that have been set up by the Government since they came into office in 1979. Of decentralisation, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"far from representing a process of centralisation, these are examples of the exact opposite. They are designed to carry the devolutionary process one step further not just from Government to a body at arm's length, but from such bodies to the grass roots delivery point."</p></blockquote>
When the Government bring forward clause 32 and oppose our amendments to it, we must remember that they want councils to act on the model of the quangos—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman referring to clause 23? He must also bear in mind that we are not having a clause stand part debate, but are discussing amendment No. 219.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And amendments Nos. 220 and 212.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes and they are grouped with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. The amendments show that the Opposition are arguing that decentralisation must be considered in relation to the community groups in the areas for which the local authority is responsible. Their views count and they must be kept informed. The Minister may agree with that, but it is a different story when one considers what the Government do, instead of what they say. They set up quangos which they claim are also about decentralisation and about getting Government
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the grass roots delivery point."</p></blockquote>
That is similar to the decentralisation schemes that they suggest for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I raised with Scottish Enterprise Tayside the sacking of its chief executive because of a conflict of interests, I received a letter from Crawford Beveridge saying that the chief executive was sacked because the company had lost confidence in him as a result of a conflict of interests. However, Mr. Beveridge was not prepared to carry out an inquiry or to keep the grass roots on Tayside informed about the sacking because he was accountable only to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the contradiction that I am trying to highlight. The rhetoric is all about decentralisation and about grass roots and local communities, but the reality of this Tory Government is that they keep matters to themselves in their quangos. The Bill will take away more power from local authorities and give it to those quangos. The Government are interested not in decentralisation, but in centralisation. Their arguments on the Bill, and particularly against the amendments, are a complete fake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of the type of decentralisation initiatives that local authorities are undertaking. A note has been passed to me about the decentralisation schemes in Strathclyde regional council. I am not familiar with it, unlike your good self, Mr. Martin, who knows all about Strathclyde regional council. However, I refer to it because the Government use Strathclyde as an example of everything that is wrong with local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefing from Strathclyde about decentralisation shows that since 1975—the year that the council was formed—council services have been provided and managed not from Glasgow, but through local offices spread throughout the region. Since the late 1970s, the council has participated in local neighbourhood regeneration initiatives in areas of priority treatment. They were designed to bring positive improvements through corporate working between regional council services and also through involving local communities in decision making. That is why it is important to consider what local authorities are already doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde has set up local committees, has involved local people and has given them decision-making powers over the services provided to them by the regional council. It is acting in ways that the Government now say should be a duty imposed on local authorities. Are the Government telling local authorities to follow the model and example of Strathclyde? Of course not. They are saying that they want to agree—at least in terms of rhetoric—with Strathclyde regional council and to pat it on the back and say, "Well done" when that Labour-controlled local authority involves local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
communities in decisions about their services. They want to ensure that no local authority is required to follow the example of Strathclyde. Local authorities will be let off the hook by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has opposed the attempt by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East to strengthen the clause, despite the fact that his arguments do not stand up to scrutiny and that the amendments would place no requirement on local authorities. The amendments would simply provide additional guidance on how local authorities should implement decentralisation schemes. Across Scotland, people are worried about the abolition of the regional councils in particular. They are power houses which have been providing quality services since 1975, but they are about to be abolished. They have had close working relationships with the voluntary organisations in Scotland, ensuring that local services are delivered in line with local people's needs. There will be a move from regional councils and the two-tier structure to a 30-council structure. No one knows how it will work or what the implications will be for local communities or the voluntary organisations that have worked with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note from the brief that has been given to members of the Committee that the voluntary organisations think that it will cost millions to reorganise their internal structures to cope with the new councils. The Minister did not consider that when examining the transitional costs involved in local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are all over the place on the question of democracy. They know that they can be elected only if they pay lip service to the ideas of democracy, of decentralising decision-making and of involving and empowering local people. Behind that lip service and the wall of rhetoric, the Government are taking away the freedom of local authorities to do any of the things that they think they should be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities cannot carry out tasks if there are not the resources to implement them. The Government are denying resources to local authorities. That is why the clause does not need to stand part of the Bill. I know that we are not having a clause stand part debate, but I believe that the Government do not mean what they say. If they do not provide resources to councils so that they can do something, nothing will happen. Whoever controls the purse strings controls what happens. The Secretary of State and his minions on the Government Benches control the purse strings. As long as that continues, it does not matter what people in local government think. They cannot do anything because they are restrained by the tight rein of the Conservatives. That is a disgrace.
Members of the Committee—especially Conservative Members who think of themselves as fair-minded and objective—should vote for the amendment after listening closely to the arguments instead of following the lead given to them by the Minister, who does not know what he is speaking about. They should not behave like puppy dogs or lap dogs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. You are being generous, and rightly so because the amendment is important. I wanted to contribute during the clause stand part debate. Will you give guidance to members of the Committee who might want to make general remarks?
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
Should they contribute now, or wait until the clause stand part debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in the hands of the Committee. If hon. Members spend a considerable time discussing amendments—they are straying wide of them—it may be that I will consider us to have had a clause stand part debate. That is the difficulty for the hon.

Members must keep to a discussion of the amendment or they will be running a risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I ask you to consider the matter carefully. There is a temptation to make a long speech about the amendment, but I support the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. I hoped to contribute to the clause stand part debate rather than to make a long speech at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter is in the hands of the Committee. Longer contributions about the amendment will not work. I must give due notice that I will call to order hon. Members who become involved in tedious repetition or stray from the amendment. If my words are not heeded, I might dispense with a clause stand part debate. That is entirely up to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Martin. My contribution will be reasonably brief. I also accept the wisdom o sticking to discussing the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the Minister have failed the test this morning. They have been offered three reasonable amendments which probe their commitment to decentralisation and the involvement of the community. It is clear from the Minister's comments that he has not accepted the extension of participation and consultation that the amendments would provide. That throws the Government's commitment to the clause into great doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not surprising, because it has taken the Government almost 15 years to acknowledge that decentraUsation is important. We welcome the Government's conversion. The amendments probe the seriousness of that conversion and what it will mean in practice if this crazy reorganisation reaches the statute book or is ever implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our cynicism is related to the issue of consultation, with which the amendments deal. The financial resources will not be available to implement what may emerge from consultation. The Government have included a duty in the clause. Like many of my hon. Friends, I have experience of local government and we know that duties mean money. They are not optional extras. It is irresponsible for the Government to include the serious concept of decentraUsation in the Bill when they are unwilling to provide resources. Indeed, they claim that decentralisation will not cost more and that it will even save expenditure. Clearly, it will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is aware of the good practices of many local authorities in Scotland, and especially Labour councils, it will be obvious to him that good schemes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
require diligent planning, effective staffing, using skills to get community involvement and public participation, and good communications between the centre and the decentralised units. The amendments aim to ensure that those issues are thought through clearly when schemes are established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are designed to get voluntary groups participating in the process and they urge serious consultation. Let us imagine what could happen under this crazy reorganisation if council officers or elected members want to involve voluntary groups. How ridiculous it would be if, after all the discussion and consultation, the representatives of the community say, "This is a duty. We are going through the motions, but we have to tell you that if we implement our scheme, it will mean a tax hike on the council tax". That tax will be bloated beyond belief by this crazy reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another possibility is even worse. If local authorities take the duty seriously and implement it without a council tax hike, they will have to cut costs in other areas of local government. That could mean cuts in services and jobs. The amendments are designed to probe the Government's commitment to the scheme. We now know that they want to get the public involved for mischievous reasons. They want to screw up the process of local government and litter the authorities with area committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may say that, but am I right or wrong? Are we discussing a duty? Is it a "shall" or a "may"? Has the clause been drafted wrongly? I invite the Minister to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has clearly not read the clause. There is a general duty to have a decentralisation scheme, but the clause makes it clear that the area committees, to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, are an option. They are not obligatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly not clear from the clause. Area committees are only one aspect of a long subsection. A duty is a duty. For the first time in local government debates in Parliament do we have new definitions of "shall", "may" and "duty"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was involved in local government, a duty had to be taken seriously, implemented and then properly costed. Are we to believe that the Government are not committed to the mess in clause 23, to which we have tabled amendments so that there is proper consultation in the community? We now find the Government are not committed to the clause, because the Minister is still saying that they may have this and they may have that. Clearly, the details of any decentralisation scheme will be left to the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely certain that the details will be left to the local authority. For example, will the duty to draw up a decentralisation scheme apply to joint boards, such as the police and fire joint board? If so, will it apply to one particular council on the joint board? Will all three councils have to agree a decentralisation scheme, or can there be three separate schemes through the joint boards? Those issues have not yet been raised in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am being too charitable in my understanding of what the Minister means. My hon. Friend raises a significant issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are about participation, consultation and the seriousness of decentralisation in relation to local committees. What about joint committees in an area such as Strathclyde if, indeed, the Government go ahead with their crazy proposals? How much decentralisation will there be? Will all the new authorities have a decentralisation scheme? Will the joint police committee and the joint fire committee and other committees also want decentralisation schemes? Will these provisions cause the biggest explosion of staffing that has ever been seen in Scotland? However, I shall not pursue that point, Mr. Martin, as you have given clear guidance that you want us to stick to these consultative amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fife has excellent authorities. Over the past two or three years, Kirkcaldy district council has pioneered some excellent, if expensive, decentralisation programmes. The authority is interested in providing quality and will not penny pinch if it can provide a better service to its consumers. Nevertheless, such programmes are expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to believe that the groups referred to in amendments Nos. 219, 220 and 212 will not worry about the costs involved? There are two ways that community groups can regard this issue. They can accept that decentralisation is a sound concept that they wish to pay for. If so, that is democracy—it is about value for money and the quality of services. However, those groups may be over-cynical, especially if the Government are confused about a duty, and ask themselves whether consultation will lead to any improvement in their quality of life. Will it mean an improvement in the delivery of services? Will it mean greater access to the corridors of power in town halls throughout Scotland? If such groups feel cynical enough, and if these proposals are not backed up by serious money, they may disengage from the consultative process that the amendments are designed to strengthen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard some confused comments from the Minister about a duty. The amendments attempt to probe the seriousness of the issue of decentralisation. I have talked about the failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister willing to put on record that the Government will foot the bill for decentralisation schemes to proceed? We already know from the Minister that this crazy reorganisation could cost between £120 million and £196 million. Are we now adding extra costs? I am a reasonable person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that encouragement from my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. The Committee deserves to know whether clause 23—we are using the amendments as a way of finding out how serious its provisions are—will be backed by serious money. Does its Conservative Member intend to answer that question? If there is a serious-commitment, will there be serious money? I do not see much animation on the Government Benches. Even the surrogate Minister, the Member for Ayr, is not responding to the call. We can take from that that we live in an extremely cynical world where the Government want to pretend that they have been genuinely converted to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
decentralisation but fall short by failing to back up their commitment with serious money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments should have been accepted. This was the litmus test of how far the Government wanted to proceed. In amendment No. 219 we are even offering the prospect of much greater public involvement in committee work. In amendment No. 212 we are looking at voluntary and community organisations. The amendment is designed to find out how committed the Government are to the voluntary sector. There is great anxiety in Scotland about the crazy reorganisation and how it will affect the voluntary sector. Would it not be right for the Committee to reaffirm its commitment to the voluntary sector by including the amendment in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend understand why this has not been included in the Bill. One of the most important organisations in the voluntary sector in communities is the community council. The two community councils that are closest to the Minister are those in Barrhead and Neilson. They have both said that they do not want to be part of East Renfrewshire. If they are so fundamentally opposed even to the concept, what chance has the Minister of getting their support in future? Perhaps that is the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises some serious issues which we could discuss for some time Mr. Martin, but I doubt that your tolerance would extend that far. Serious questions about the Government's commitment to the Bill have been raised. Clause 23 has now been exposed for what it is. The amendments have helped to expose the sham of a Government who are converted but not committed. They are willing to talk a lot but not to put any money where their mouth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three simple amendments have been rejected. That is a disappointment for the Opposition and an embarrassment for the Government, but at least it has ensured a debate which exposed what the Government are doing. We will continue to press home the point about
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
cost. It is the Bill's Achilles's heel. The Government will not face the cost implications. They have whitewashed any criticism of the cost. When we get into serious consultation the organisations identified in the amendments will want to know whether the Government are serious or whether it is just another of their cynical exercises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on amendment No. 219 about involving community groups in the committee's deliberations. I have been very much involved with community groups in my constituency work and before I was elected to Parliament. I should also like to speak to amendment No. 220 on the provision of officers and administrative arrangement and to amendment No. 212 on consulting voluntary and community organisations. You wisely grouped the amendments together, Mr. Martin because they are related.
